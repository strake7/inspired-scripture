<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is part of final psalms where each psalm begins and ends with a praise for Yahweh (Ps. 146-150). This psalm celebrates God’s faithfulness in gathering the Jews back in Jerusalem after they were scattered during their captivity. It also foreshadows when God’s people will be gathered in the new Jerusalem in heaven. The psalmist urged the Jews to praise God’s faithfulness. You can also praise Jesus for His faithfulness. His Word always comes true. From this psalm, the Bible reveals ways for you to respond to Jesus’ faithfulness. These include: (1) praise, (2) love, (3) humility, (4) trust, (5) reverent fear, (6) gratitude, and (7) evangelism.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, God was faithful in gathering back the Jews, in rebuilding the physical infrastructure of Jerusalem, and healing the Jews’ broken hearts. Thus, the psalmist urged God’s people to praise Him. You can also praise Jesus for His compassionate faithfulness to you. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist praised God that He could love every detail of His vast creation, including His lowly people. Jesus also has a faithful and indescribable love for you. You can respond by loving Him with all your mind, heart, and soul. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist praised God for caring about His humbled people and uplifting them from their exiled status. You can also respond to Jesus’ faithfulness with humble submission so that He can also uplift you in His timing. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist urged God’s people to praise Him for providing for all His creation. Jesus is also faithful to provide for you. You can respond by trusting Him. <u>Fifth</u>, God did not love Israel because it was once a mighty nation. Instead, He loved those who placed their hope in Him with reverent fear. You can also respond to Jesus’ faithfulness with reverence. This means hating what He calls evil in His Word. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist urged God’s people to praise Him for the protection, peace, and contentment that He offered in the rebuilt Jerusalem. Jesus offers protection, peace, and contentment both now and in the new Jerusalem in heaven. You can also respond with joyful gratitude. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist reminded God’s people that they were privileged to receive God’s Word. You are also privileged to have received God’s Word. Jesus is the Word who became flesh. You can respond to His faithfulness by sharing His Word with the lost.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to restore His people both physically and emotionally</u>. The psalmist cried out with joyful praise in response to God’s faithfulness in freeing the Jews from captivity, rebuilding Jerusalem, and healing their deep pain. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant and praise is beautiful</em>. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</em>” (Ps. 147:1-3). “The rebuilding of Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonish captivity covered a space of above ninety years, from B.C. 538 till B.C. 445. First the temple was built (B.C. 533-515); then the city; finally, the walls and the gates ( B.C. 445). It was in connection with this last portion of the building that the present psalm seems to have been written …The exiles returned gradually - some with Zerubbabel ( B.C. 538); some with Ezra, in B.C. 457; others, doubtless, with Nehemiah, in B.C. 445; and again in B.C. 434.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 147:2-3).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is worthy to be praised</u>. The psalmist declared that “<em>it is good to sing praises to our God</em>.” (Ps. 147:1). Another psalmist gave a similar exhortation to God’s people. “<em>It is good to give thanks to the LORD</em> and to sing praises to Your name, Most High;” (Ps. 92:1). Some believe these specific praises correspond with the Levites’ dedication of Jerusalem’s rebuilt walls. “It must have been written at a time when Jerusalem was enjoying special tokens of the restoration of Jehovah’s favor; and it is a not improbable conjecture that it was composed for the Festival of the Dedication of the walls of Jerusalem celebrated by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>). After the completion of the walls of Jerusalem Nehemiah summoned the Levites settled in the neighborhood to assemble at Jerusalem. The Priests and Levites purified themselves, and then purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. Two processions were formed of the Priests and Levites with the princes of Judah: one accompanied by Ezra went to the right, the other accompanied by Nehemiah went to the left. On the east of the city the processions met, and went to the Temple, where sacrifices were offered in the midst of general rejoicings.” (Alexander Francis Kirkpatrick, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Ps. 147).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Under Nehemiah, the Jews celebrated God’s faithfulness in restoring Jerusalem<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to restore Israel</u>. The psalmist praised God for gathering the “<em>the outcasts of Israel.</em>” (Ps. 147:2). Assuming this psalm corresponds with Nehemiah’s time, he also praised God for faithfully gathering the previously scattered Jews. “but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, <em>though those of you who have been scattered were in the most remote part of the heavens, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I have chosen to have My name dwell</em>.” (Neh. 1:9). Through His prophets, God repeatedly promised to restore His scatted people: “And He will lift up a flag for the nations and assemble the banished ones of Israel, and <em>will gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth</em>.” (Is. 11:12). “Then <em>I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them</em>, and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply.” (Jer. 23:3). “Hear the word of the LORD, you nations, and declare it in the coastlands far away, and say, ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him, and <em>He will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock</em>.”’ (Jer. 31:10). “I will certainly assemble all of you, Jacob, <em>I will certainly gather the remnant of Israel</em>. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; like a flock in the midst of its pasture they will be noisy with people.” (Micah 2:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God comforts the brokenhearted</u>. In addition to restoring Israel, God also healed His people. “<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</em>” (Ps. 147:3). ‘“<em>For I will restore you to health and I will heal you of your wounds</em>,’ declares the LORD, ‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying: ‘It is Zion; no one cares for her.”’ (Jer. 30:17). “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD anointed me to bring good news to the humble; <em>He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted</em>, to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners;” (Is. 61:1). “Come, let’s return to the LORD. For He has torn us, but <em>He will heal us</em>; He has wounded us, but <em>He will bandage us</em>.” (Hos. 6:1). “Yet even now,” declares the LORD, ‘Return to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, weeping, and mourning;’ And tear your heart and not merely your garments.’ Now return to the LORD your God, for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in mercy and relenting of catastrophe.” (Joel 2:12-13).</p></li>

<p>Jesus heals the brokenhearted<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will also gather and heal His people in the New Jerusalem</u>. The events of the Old Testament all foreshadow events in the New Testament. “Having accomplished the longed for new exodus, return from exile, and new conquests, the Lord builds the new Jerusalem in fulfillment of Ps 127:1. The new building also comes with the healing of broken hearts and the binding up wounds in 147:3. John speaks to the same work of the Lord when he writes of the wiping away of every tear in Rev 21:4. The sovereign Lord builds the new Jerusalem, and he builds the new heavens, …” (James Hamilton on Ps. 147:1-3).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Like the Jews, you also have many reasons to praise and glorify Jesus.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s love for every detail of creation is beyond our fully understanding</u>. The psalmist marveled that a God who knew and loved every detail of His unimaginably vast creation could love such a lowly people. “<em><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite</em>.” (Ps. 147:2-5). By one “rough estimate of 10 trillion galaxies in the universe. Multiplying that by the Milky Way’s estimated 100 billion stars results in a large number indeed: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a ‘1’ with 24 zeros after it (1 septillion in the American numbering system; 1 quadrillion in the European system).”<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> “The same God who cares for the lowly individual also knows and names all the stars. His majesty extends in both directions, from the span of the universe to the individual need. The psalmist allowed us to the make the logical conclusion – that if God knows and names all the stars, He certainly knows me and names me.” (David Guzik on Ps. 147:4).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God knows and cares for every detail of His creation</u>. The psalmist praised God who both created and named every star in the vast universe, “<em>He gives names to all of them.</em>” (Ps. 147:4). Isaiah made a similar claim. “Raise your eyes on high and <em>see who has created these stars,</em> the One who brings out their multitude by number, <em>He calls them all by name</em>; because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, not one of them is missing.” (Is. 40:26). As a sign of Jesus’ love for every person, He also pointed out that He knows every hair on your head. “But even the hairs of your head are all counted.” (Matt. 10:30). “But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not fear; you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows.” (Lk. 12:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also knows and cares about your every thought</u>. God further uses His omnipotent power to take an interest in your thoughts. “LORD, You have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I get up; You understand my thought from far away. You scrutinize my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. <em>Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, LORD, You know it all</em>.” (Ps. 139:1-4). “It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will listen.” (Is. 65:24). “So do not be like them; for <em>your Father knows what you need before you ask Him</em>.” (Matt. 6:8). “that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart, and <em>He knows all things</em>.” (1 Jo. 3:20).</p></li>

<p>Jesus cares for and loves every detail of His Creation, including your every thought<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s love for mankind is beyond our full understanding</u>. The psalmist argued that “<em>Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is infinite</em>.” (Ps. 147:5). His love is beyond mankind’s full understanding. “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot comprehend it.” (Ps. 139:6). “Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth does not become weary or tired. His understanding is unsearchable.” (Is. 40:28). “Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; the number of His years is unsearchable.” (Job 36:26). “Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!” (Ro. 11:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Respond to God’s love by showing your love for Him</u>. When asked to identify the greatest of the Ten Commandments, Jesus stated that it is to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul: “And He said to him, ‘you shall love the Lord your God <em>with all your heart</em>, and with all <em>your soul</em>, and with <em>all your mind</em>.”’ (Matt. 22:37; Mk. 12:30; Lk. 10:27). “And you shall love the LORD your God <em>with all your heart</em> and with <em>all your soul</em> and with all <em>your strength</em>.” (Dt. 6:5). “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God <em>with all your heart</em> and with all <em>your soul</em>,” (Dt. 10:12). This is what Jesus desires most from you.</p></li>

<h2 id="humility-respond-to-jesus-faithfulness-with-humble-submission.-ps.-1476."><strong>3. <u>Humility: Respond to Jesus’ Faithfulness with Humble Submission</u>. Ps. 147:6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to support humble believers against the proud</u>. Even though God’s people were lowly next to His infinite universe, the psalmist praised God for faithfully lifting His humbled people from their many afflictions during exile. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> supports the afflicted; He brings the wicked down to the ground</em>.” (Ps. 147:6). God supports or uplifts the “<span dir="rtl">עֲנָוִ֣ים</span>” (‘ă·nā·wîm). In the NASB, this is translated as “<em>afflicted</em>.” In the KJB, this is translated as the “<em>meek</em>.” In the NKJV, NIV, Berean, and other translations, this is translated as the “<em>humble</em>.” “He reverses the evil order of things. The meek are down, and he lifts them up; the wicked are exalted, and he hurls them down to the dust … In this verse we see the practical outcome of that character of Jehovah which leads him to count and call the stars as if they were little things, while he deals tenderly with sorrowful men, as if they were precious in his esteem. He is so great that nothing is great to him, and he is so condescending that nothing is little to him: his infinite majesty thus naturally brings low the lofty and exalts the lowly.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 147:6).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God exalts those who humble themselves before Him</u>.  The Jews who returned from exile wanted to be exalted among the nations as Israel once was under King David and King Solomon. But God will humble His people before He exalts them:  “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, and has exalted those who were humble.”  (Lk. 1:52).  “But the humble will inherit the land and will delight themselves in abundant prosperity.” (Ps. 37:11). God also wants you to humble yourself so that He can exalt you in heaven: “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble … Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.”  (Jam. 4:6, 10). “So that He sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.” (Job 5:11).  Thus, if you want to be called great in heaven, humble yourself before God. “So whoever will humble himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt. 18:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God can restore any nation that humbles itself before Him.</u> God’s promises apply equally to both individuals and to a nation that repents and turns to Him:  “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”  (2 Chr. 7:14).  Are you praying for your leaders and nation to repent?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t take pride in what God has done in your life</u>.  Every good and perfect thing that you have comes from God  (Jam. 1:17).  Your acts of righteousness are but filthy rags before Him (Is. 64:6).  All have sinned before Him  (Ro. 3:23; 1 Pet. 2:22; Ps. 14:3).  If your righteousness came through keeping the law or your good works, then Jesus’ death was unnecessary  (Gal. 2:21).  God wants to show you mercy and grace so that you can serve Him.  But He cannot use you if you are filled with pride: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”  (Prov. 16:18; 18:12; 11:2; 29:23).</p></li>

<h2 id="trust-respond-to-jesus-faithful-provision-by-trusting-him.-ps.-1477-9."><strong>4. <u>Trust: Respond to Jesus’ Faithful Provision by Trusting Him</u>. Ps. 147:7-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to provide for all of His creation</u>. The psalmist urged God’s people to sing praises for His provision for all creation, including creatures that the Jews considered to be unclean and loathsome. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with thanksgiving; sing praises to our God on the lyre; <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>it is He who covers the heavens with clouds, who provides rain for the earth, who makes grass sprout on the mountains. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It is He who gives an animal its food, and feeds young ravens that cry</em>.” (Ps. 147:7-9). “Through the plenty of grass growing upon the mountains, by the rain falling from the clouds of heaven upon them: these cannot provide for themselves, but the Lord feeds them; and they wait upon him for their food, and receive it of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>. How much more will he feed his own people, both with temporal and spiritual food; though in their fallen state they are become like the beasts, of which they are sensible when called by grace, and own and acknowledge it! <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 147:8-9).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>As the Creator, God provides for His creation</u>.  The psalmist celebrated that God provides for all His creation:  “<em><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>it is He who covers the heavens with clouds, who provides rain for the earth,</em>” (Ps. 147:8). God’s creation of Earth’s life-giving water cycle is proof of His love for all His creation. “yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”  (Act 14:17).  “You visit the earth and cause it to overflow; You greatly enrich it; the stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain, for so You prepare the earth.”  (Ps. 65:9). “He causes the mist to ascend from the ends of the earth, He makes lightning for the rain; He brings forth the wind from His treasuries.” (Ps. 135:7). “When He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens, and He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain, and brings out the wind from His storehouses.” (Jer. 10:13). “Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain? Or can the heavens grant showers? Is it not You, LORD our God? Therefore we wait for You, for You are the one who has done all these things.” (Jer. 14:22). When Job questioned God, God asked him who created Earth’s life-giving water cycle, “Who has split open a channel for the flood, and a way for the thunderbolt, to bring rain on a land without people, on a desert without a person in it, to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the seeds of grass to sprout?” (Job 38:25-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God provides for all creation, you can trust Him to provide for you as well</u>. The psalmist celebrated that God provides for even the loathsome creatures, like the raven. “<em>It is He who gives an animal its food, and feeds young ravens that cry</em>.” (Ps. 147:9). As unclean birds, the ravens were “not only neglected by men, but also forsaken by their dams as soon as ever they can fly, and so are wholly left to the care and keeping of Divine Providence.” (Matthew Poole on Ps. 147:9).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> God asked Job who provided for the needs of the raven. “Who prepares feed for the raven when its young cry to God, and wander about without food?” (Job 38:41). “They all wait for You to give them their food in due season. You give to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good.” (Ps. 104:27-28). Because God provides for even the smallest creatures, like the birds, you can also trust Him to provide for your needs as well. “Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather crops into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they? And which of you by worrying can add a single day to his life’s span?” (Matt. 6:26-27).</p></li>

<h2 id="fearing-god-respond-to-jesus-faithfulness-with-reverence.-ps.-14710-11."><strong>5. <u>Fearing God: Respond to Jesus’ Faithfulness with Reverence</u>. Ps. 147:10-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to bless those who fear Him</u>. The psalmist reminded the Jews that God did not love them because they were once a powerful nation. Instead, He loved those who demonstrated their hope in Him through reverent fear. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> favors those who fear Him, those who wait for His faithfulness</em>.” (Ps. 147:10-11). The psalmist said that God favors those who wait or put their hope in God’s “<span dir="rtl">לְחַסְדּֽו</span>ֹ׃” (<em>hesed</em>). In the NASB, this is translated as His “<em>faithfulness</em>.” In the KJB and the NKJV, this is translated as His “<em>mercy</em>.” In the NIV, this is translated as His “<em>unfailing love</em>”. In the Berean Bible, this is called His “<em>loving devotion</em>.” “The advantages afforded, as in war by the strength of the horse or the agility of man, do not incline God to favor any; but those who fear and, of course, trust Him, will obtain His approbation and aid.” (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Ps. 147:10-11).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> “God created these things, but they are not what fundamentally <strong>delight</strong> Him … What God takes pleasure in is the reverence and trust of His people. Those who find their <strong>hope in His mercy</strong> delight God, because they honor Him with their trust.” (David Guzik on Ps. 147:10-11).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Respond to Jesus’ Faithful Love With Reverent Fear<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God wants you to trust in Him alone</u>. The Jews longed for the respect that they once enjoyed. But God wanted His people to place their trust in Him, not through the might of becoming a powerful nation again. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the LORD.”’ (Jer. 17:5). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in people. It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in noblemen.” (Ps. 118:8-9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God promises to bless those who fear Him and put their hope in Him</u>. The psalmist declared that God “<em>favors those who fear Him, those who wait for His faithfulness</em>.” (Ps. 147:11). God repeatedly promised to bless those who fear Him. “<em>He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him</em>; He will also hear their cry for help and save them.” (Ps. 145:19). “Behold, the eye of <em>the LORD is on those who fear Him</em>, on those who wait for His faithfulness, to rescue their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.” (Ps. 33:18-19). God further blesses those with the faith to put their hope in Him. “Yet <em>those who wait for the LORD will gain new strength</em>; they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.” (Is. 40:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>You fear God when you “hate” what He calls evil</u>. The Bible is also clear regarding the definition of “fearing God”. You fear Him when you “hate” what He calls evil. “<em>The fear of the LORD is to hate evil</em>; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). This includes disobeying God. “<em>For rebellion is as reprehensible as the sin of divination</em>, and insubordination is as reprehensible as false religion and idolatry ...” (1 Sam 15:23a). It also includes rejecting what God calls evil in His Word. “<em>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil</em>; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” (Is. 5:20).</p></li>

Ps. 147:12-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to provide His people with security, peace, and contentment</u>. Because it was God’s will for Jerusalem to be rebuilt, the psalmist gave thanks that the Jews could enjoy security, peace, satisfaction, and abundant harvests of fine food.“<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Jerusalem! Praise your God, Zion! <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your sons among you. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>He makes peace in your borders; He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat.</em>” (Ps. 147:12-14). “Cities were surrounded by walls. They were entered through gates. Those gates were fastened by bars passed across them, to which the gates were secured. The language here might be applicable to any period, but it is probable that there is particular reference to Jerusalem as made strong in rebuilding it after the return from Babylon. He hath blessed thy children within thee - The inhabitants, by giving them safety and peace … The idea is that peace prevailed throughout the land.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 147:13-14).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Through Jesus, you can find security and peace in a fallen world</u>. The psalmist said that God had “<em>strengthened the bars of your gates;</em>” in order to make “<em>peace in your borders;</em>” (Ps. 147:13-14). This repeated God’s promise through Isaiah. “Then my people will live in a peaceful settlement, in secure dwellings, and in undisturbed resting places;” (Is. 32:18). When you place your trust in God, He offers you peace and security. “In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You alone, LORD, have me dwell in safety.” (Ps. 4:8). “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:7). “Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “Let the peace of Christ, to which you were indeed called in one body, rule in your hearts; and be thankful.” (Col. 3:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the new Jerusalem, Jesus offers eternal security, peace, and satisfaction</u>. Just as Jesus prepared a new Jerusalem for the Jews after captivity, He has prepared a new Jerusalem for believers. “And I saw the holy city, <em>new Jerusalem</em>, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (Rev. 21:2). There, you will also be protected from evil. “Awake, awake, clothe yourself in your strength, Zion; clothe yourself with your beautiful garments, <em>Jerusalem, the holy city; For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer come into you</em>.” (Is. 52:1). “and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.” (Rev. 21:27). Having been purified through faith in Jesus, you will also have the satisfaction of an eternal relationship with Him. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matt. 5:8). “Therefore you too have grief now; but <em>I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one is going to take your joy away from you</em>.” (Jo. 16:22). “and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.” (Rev. 21:4).</p></li>

<h2 id="evangelism-respond-to-jesus-faithful-word-by-sharing-it.-ps.-14715-20."><strong>7. <u>Evangelism: Respond to Jesus’ Faithful Word by Sharing It</u>. Ps. 147:15-20.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God provided His people with His Word, which offers wisdom and always comes true</u>. The psalmist concluded by reminding the Jews that God had blessed them with His Word and His Covenant to be a light to the world. “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He sends His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>He showers snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He hurls His ice as fragments; who can stand before His cold? <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>He sends His word and makes them melt; He makes His wind blow, and the waters flow</em>. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He has not dealt this way with any other nation; and as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 147:15-20). “The climax of creation came with the forming of human beings; and so ultimately God entrusted them with his word. But because people rejected the creator and his word, he gave it to his covenant people to make them distinct from the nation … All of us who have been redeemed are entrusted with the word of God. This is not only a reason for praise, but a solemn responsibility to carry the message of God to people who remain alienated from him.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 147).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> “Election is the loudest call for grateful adoration.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 147:20).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust that His Word will always be fulfilled</u>. The psalmist declared that God “<em>sends His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly.</em>” (Ps. 147:15). God’s Word will always be fulfilled. “So will My word be which goes out of My mouth; it will not return to Me empty, without accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding in the purpose for which I sent it.” (Is. 55:11). ‘“Is My word not like fire?’ declares the LORD, ‘and like a hammer which shatters a rock?”’ (Jer. 23:29). As an example of this, the psalmist declared, “<em>He showers snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes.”</em> (Ps. 147:16). Elihu made a similar declaration to Job. ‘“For to the snow He says, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the downpour and the rain, ‘Be strong.”’ (Job 37:6). The psalmist also declared, “<em>He hurls His ice as fragments; who can stand before His cold? He sends His word and makes them melt; He makes His wind blow, and the waters flow</em>.” (Ps. 147:17-18). This was also similar to Elihu’s declaration to Job. “From the south comes the storm, and from the north wind the cold. From the breath of God ice is made, and the expanse of the waters is frozen.” (Job 37:9-10). “The thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and the thawing wind the Spirit of Christ; for the Spirit is compared to the wind, Joh 3:8. Converting grace softens the heart that was hard frozen, and melts it into tears of repentance, and makes good reflections to flow, which before were chilled and stopped up. The change which the thaw makes is very evident, yet how it is done no one can say. Such is the change wrought in the conversion of a soul, when God’s word and Spirit are sent to melt it and restore it to itself.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 147:15-20).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God blessed Israel so that others could see that His promise always comes true</u>. Unlike any other nation, the psalmist declared that God had blessed Israel with His Covenant. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.</em> <em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He has not dealt this way with any other nation; and as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 147:19-20). This was similar to Moses’ declaration to the Jews. “For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him? Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Law which I am setting before you today?” (Dt. 4:7-8). “Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? Great in every respect. First, that they were entrusted with the actual words of God.” (Ro. 3:1-2). The Jews were meant to reflect God’s light (Is. 42:6 49:6). So are you (Matt. 5:14-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Share the good news by fulfilling Jesus’ Great Commission</u>.  As part of the Great Commission, Jesus wants you to share His offer of salvation: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”  (Matt. 28:18-20).  Are you sharing Jesus’ good news?</p></li>
