<p>2 Chr. 25: From Amaziah’s Reign and Mistakes as King, Seven Lesson on Being a Good Leader</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: Chronicles documents the sad apostacy and decline of Judah after King David. Following Elisha’s death (2 Kgs. 13:20), the kings in Northern Israel and Judah reigned without consistently listening to God’s prophets. As a result, both nations suffered. This chapter records many events regarding the reign of King Amaziah of Judah. From his reign and his mistakes, God reveals seven lessons for being a good leader. These include: (1) obedience, (2) fairness / justice, (3) faith / trust, (4) vigilance, (5) humility, (6) the fear of God, and (7) repentance.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Amaziah ruled Judah with only partial obedience towards God. Although he initially started off with good intentions, he drifted in his walk with God and eventually embraced idolatry. From Amaziah’s mistakes, God reveals that a good leader fully obeys His Word. <span class="underline">Second</span>, before he rebelled against God, Amaziah was fair and just by judging his father’s assassins by withholding judgment from their innocent family members. From Amaziah’s example, God reveals that a good leader is fair and just in his or her decisions and in dealing with others. <span class="underline">Third</span>, also before he rebelled against God, Amaziah listened to God’s prophet and reduced the size of his army before going to war with Edom. From Amaziah’s example, God reveals that a good leader has faith and trusts Him. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, Amaziah then took a turn for the worse. He began to follow the idols from the nation that he defeated. In his success, he became complacent in his walk. From his mistake, God reveals that a good leader must remain vigilant in guarding his or her heart against evil temptations that frequently follow success. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, in addition to his idolatry, Amaziah became prideful and threatened Northern Israel with a war that God did not sanction. From Amaziah’s many mistakes, God reveals that a good leader is humble and is led by the Holy Spirit. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, Amaziah refused to accept warnings that he would lose his war. Because he would not turn from his pride and idolatry, God allowed Judah to lose, and he became a prisoner. From Amaziah’s defiance, God reveals that a good leader fears Him by hating evil. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, after being freed from prison, God allowed Amaziah to rule Judah for another 15 years. Yet, he refused to repent or restore his people from the injuries that he inflicted upon them. As a result, the people hated him, and assassins later murdered him. From Amaziah’s mistakes, God reveals that a good leader repents after receiving God’s discipline.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Obedience: A Good Leader Fully Obeys God’s Word</span>. 2 Chr. 25:1-2.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah becomes King of Judah and only partially follows God’s laws</span>. Like his father King Joash (Jehoash), Amaziah ruled Judah with only partial obedience towards God: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. <sup>2 </sup>He did right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, yet not with a whole heart</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:1-2). King Joash’s servants Jozacar and Jehozabad killed him as part of a conspiracy against him. As a result, Joash’s son Amaziah became king of Judah at age 25 (2 Kgs. 12:21). He reigned 29 years, from 796-767 B.C. (2 Chr. 25:1-2). The name Amaziah means “strength of Jehovah”. He at first did many things right as king. God previously guided events to eradicate state-sanctioned Baal worship in both Judah (2 Kgs. 11:17-18) and in Northern Israel (2 Kgs. 10:18-28). Amaziah ensured that Baal worship did not reemerge in Judah. God had also ensured that His Temple was repaired for proper worship (2 Kg. 12:9-15). For a time, Amaziah protected the Temple as well. As set forth below, he also initially trusted God in a battle with Edom. Yet, like his father before him, he tolerated evil by allowing many pagan worship temples to exist. The book of Kings explains that “<sup>3 </sup>He did right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, yet not like David his father; he did according to all that Joash his father had done. <sup>4 </sup>Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.” (2 Kgs. 14:3-4). His tolerance of evil would ultimately become a snare upon him and turn his heart against God.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Like his father, Amaziah disobeyed God’s commands by tolerating evil in Judah</span>. Canaanite pagan altars were typically built on “high places” (1 Kgs. 13:32; Jer. 7:31). Whenever the Jews came across pagan altars, they were ordered to destroy them: “then you shall . . . destroy all their figured stones . . . and demolish all their <em>high places</em>;” (Nu. 33:52). “You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, <em>on the high mountains</em> and on the hills and under every green tree. You shall tear down their altars . . .” (Dt. 12:2-3). Failing to observe this rule would eventually cause the Jews to blend their worship of God with Canaanite pagan practices: “ . . . For on every <em>high hill</em> and under every green tree you have lain down as a harlot.” (Jer. 2:20). Failing to follow this rule also caused many kings to stumble. Possibly in the name of celebrating diversity, Amaziah later embraced the pagan Edomite gods (2 Chron. 25:14-16). This was the outgrowth of the seeds of sin in his life.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Partial disobedience was the beginning of the downfall of many kings</span>. Amaziah was not alone in his path to failure that began with partial disobedience by not removing the pagan high places of worship. His father, King Joash, committed the exact same sin: “Only the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.” (2 Kgs. 12:3). And their forefathers committed the same sin as well. King Solomon was a reformer who ultimately led a path to failure that began with the same small act of disobedience in refusing to remove the pagan worship centers (1 Kgs. 3:2). He later built special altars on “high places” for his foreign wives to worship their pagan gods (1 Kgs. 11:7-8). King Jeroboam later followed after Solomon’s example and built altars for idol worship with unauthorized priests (1 Kgs. 12:31). King Asa’s disobedience in this area also led to his downfall (1 Kgs. 15:14). King Jehoshaphat was also a reformer who failed for the same acts of disobedience (1 Kgs. 22:43). King Manasseh later rebuilt pagan altars on high places after King Hezekiah destroyed them (2 Kgs. 21:3). Thus, several kings began with great intentions. Yet, their partial or full disobedience led to their downfall. Their disobedience also effected their kingdoms.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Partial obedience can be corrected if you open your heart and repent of your sins</span>. Although Amaziah initially did right in God’s eyes, he was “<em>not like David his father</em>.” (2 Kgs. 14:3). To many, it might seem curious for God to consider David as a role model. At one point in David’s life, he violated at least seven of God’s Ten Commandments (2 Sam. 11:1-27). <span class="underline">First</span>, by lusting after his neighbor Uriah’s wife Bathsheba, he violated God’s <strong>Tenth Commandment against coveting</strong> (Ex. 20:17; Dt. 5:21). <span class="underline">Second</span>, by repeatedly giving into his lusts of his flesh, he made an idol out of attractive women and violated God’s Second Commandment (Ex. 20:4-5; Dt. 5:8-9). <span class="underline">Third</span>, by sleeping with a married woman, he violated God’s Seventh Commandment against adultery (Ex. 20:14; Dt. 5:18). <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, he violated God’s Sixth Commandment against murder when he killed Uriah (Ex. 20:13; Dt. 5:17). <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, by engaging in lies and deceit to cover up his neighbor Uriah’s murder, he violated God’s Ninth Commandment against bearing false witness (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, after he later married Bathsheba, he violated God’s law against a leader having more than one wife (Dt. 17:17). To become king, he would have made a public vow to uphold the Torah. By breaking his vow before God, David also profaned His holy name (Lev. 19:12). Thus, his actions also violated the Third Commandment (Ex. 20:7; Dt. 5:11). <span class="underline">Finally</span>, as God’s appointed king, David violated the Fifth Commandment by dishonoring his heavenly Father (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Even if he only broke one Commandment, he would have broken them all (Jam. 2:10). David came to appreciate and write psalms about God’s mercy and grace only after God showed him his sins. David was a man after God’s heart not because he was perfect. Instead, he was a godly man because he later repented of his many sins (Ps. 51:4). Amaziah did not repent of his sins. As a result, his heart grew hard and his sins became worse over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Fairness / Justice: A Good Leader is Fair and Just With Others</span>. 2 Chr. 25:3-4.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah’s initial obedience in following God’s law</span>. Amaziah did not start off as an idolater. His later sins would have been hard for most to predict because he initially showed courage in ignoring the customs of the day and following God’s law by sparing the lives of the children of his father’s assassins: “<sup>3 </sup><em>Now it came about as soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who had slain his father the king. <sup>4 </sup>However, he did not put their children to death, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded, saying, ‘Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, nor sons be put to death for fathers, but each shall be put to death for his own sin</em>.’” (2 Chr. 25:3-4; 2 Kgs. 14:5-6). The Jews had seen kings kill off entire families after they deposed prior kings (e.g., 2 Kgs. 10:11). Amaziah also likely hated Jozachar and Jehozabad for betraying and murdering his father, King Joash (2 Kgs. 12:21). Thus, the people of Judah most likely expected Amaziah to kill off every living member of the murders’ families as an act of retribution and to deter future assassination attempts. Yet, Amaziah ignored Jewish custom and instead followed God’s law.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah initially faithfully judged each person according to their own actions</span>. Jozachar and Jehozabad violated God’s Sixth Commandment against murder (Ex. 20:13; Dt. 5:17). Under God’s law predating Moses, their actions carried the penalty of capital punishment: “Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man’s brother I will require the life of man.” (Gen. 9:5). “He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.” (Ex. 21:12). “If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.” (Lev. 24:17). “Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.” (Nu. 35:31). It was also the custom of that time to kill the children of a murder. Yet, that was not God’s law. God spared the innocent children from being killed for the sins of their fathers. “Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.” (Dt. 24:16). “But everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.” (Jer. 31:30). “The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” (Ezek. 18:20). Because Amaziah was initially following God’s law, God initially blessed him.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah initially succeeded because of his faith-led obedience</span>. Before his death, David advised Solomon that his success as king would depend upon his obedience: “Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, <em>that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn</em>,” (1 Kgs. 2:3). Each king was further required to write a personal copy of the law to make sure that he followed it: “Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.” (Dt. 17:18). Amaziah initially succeeded as King of Judah because of his faith-led obedience. This faith-led obedience also led to God’s blessings in his war with Edom. Yet, because he did not completely follow God’s Word, he fell off his walk.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A Spirit-led leader should pursue justice.</span> Like Amaziah at this point, God required that His kings pursue: “Justice, <em>and only</em> justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.” (Dt. 16:20). God further appointed the kings to “do justice and righteousness.” (1 Kgs. 10:9). A king is also supposed to sit “on the throne of justice.” (Prov. 20:8). This means that a Spirit-led leader must care about addressing wrongs and the plight of those in need: “The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.” (Prov. 31:9). “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.” (Ps. 82:3). “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.” (Dt. 10:18). Are you just and fair to others?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Faith / Trust: A Good Leader Has Faith and Trusts God</span>. 2 Chr. 25:5-12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah initially trusts God and defeats Edom in battle</span>. God then blessed Amaziah with a victory over Edom because he trusted God and listened to God’s prophet: “<sup>5 </sup><em>Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according to their fathers’ households under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin; and he took a census of those from twenty years old and upward and found them to be 300,000 choice men, able to go to war and handle spear and shield. <sup>6 </sup>He hired also 100,000 valiant warriors out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. <sup>7 </sup>But a man of God came to him saying, ‘O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is not with Israel nor with any of the sons of Ephraim. <sup>8 </sup>But if you do go, do it, be strong for the battle; yet God will bring you down before the enemy, for God has power to help and to bring down.’ <sup>9 </sup>Amaziah said to the man of God, ‘But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?’ And the man of God answered, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has much more to give you than this.’ <sup>10 </sup>Then Amaziah dismissed them, the troops which came to him from Ephraim, to go home; so their anger burned against Judah and they returned home in fierce anger. <sup>11 </sup>Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth, and went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 of the sons of Seir. <sup>12 </sup>The sons of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff and threw them down from the top of the cliff, so that they were all dashed to pieces. <sup>13 </sup>But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 of them and plundered much spoil</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:5-12; 2 Kgs. 14:7). When David was King of Israel, he defeated Edom (1 Kgs. 11:15). After Israel broke into two nations, Judah took control over Edom. During a war with Moab (which was under Northern Israel’s control), Edom provided troops to assist Northern Israel and Judah (2 Kgs. 3:12-26). Yet, during Jehoram’s reign, the Edomites rebelled against Judah (2 Kgs. 8:20-22). Amaziah called the able bodied men of Judah as well as others to fight against Edom. Because Amaziah trusted God and obeyed Him in this war, God blessed him with victory.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah’s initial faith in trusting God</span>. Amaziah initially assembled a large army to wage a war against Edom. This included 300,000 men of fighting age from Judah (yet most without prior fighting experience) and 100,000 mercenaries from Northern Israel (most battle tested from their wars with Aram in Syria) (2 Chr. 25:5-6). Yet, a prophet then warned Amaziah not to join forces with Northern Israel. Because of its idolatry, God was not with Northern Israel (2 Chr. 25:7-8). Amaziah initially showed great faith and trust in God by asking what to do about the money that he had already given to the mercenaries. God’s prophet promised Amaziah that he would recover this money if he trusted God (2 Chr. 25:9). Because of Amaziah’s initial faith in following God’s command to trust Him, he turned away 100,000 mercenaries from Northern Israel before a battle with Edom. For this reason, God granted him victory in battle (2 Chr. 25:11-12).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Act upon God’s Word, and He will bless you</span>. God expects you to act on His Word. Obedience is not a test for salvation. Yet, for those who obey God’s Word, He promises many kinds of blessings: “So be careful to do what the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left. Walk in all the way that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.” (Dt. 5:32-33). “O Israel, you should listen and <span class="underline">be careful to do <em>it</em></span>, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of your fathers, has promised you, <em>in</em> a land flowing with milk and honey.” (Dt. 6:3). “But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.” (Ex. 23:22). Throughout the Bible, God reminds His people that vows of obedience must be followed by action: “And the LORD said to me, ‘Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant <em>and do them</em>.’” (Jer. 11:6). In case anyone believes that these are relics of the Old Testament, they are repeated even more often in the New Testament: “Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and <em>do not do what I say</em>?” (Luke 6:46). “Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but <em>he who does the will of My</em> Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and <em>acts on them</em>, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25). “[F]or it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but <em>the doers of the Law will be justified</em>.” (Ro. 2:13). “But <em>prove yourselves doers of the word</em>, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22; see also, Rev. 14:12; 22:14). God doesn’t want you to be obedient for the wrong reasons. Out of love (and not the promise of reward) are you being obedient to God’s Word, His Spirit, and His calling in your life?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Vigilance: A Good Leader Remains Vigilant in Guarding Against Evil</span>. 2 Chr. 25:14-16.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah grows complacent in his walk and embraces idolatry</span>. Amaziah had seen God’s Word fulfilled when he was faithful. But he then became enamored with the idols that he captured, and he began to incorporate them into his worship: “<sup>14 </sup><em>Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down before them and burned incense to them. <sup>15 </sup>Then the anger of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, ‘Why have you sought the gods of the people who have not delivered their own people from your hand?’ <sup>16 </sup>As he was talking with him, the king said to him, ‘Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?’ Then the prophet stopped and said, ‘I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel</em>.’” (2 Chr. 25:14-16). Amaziah assumed that he was responsible for his victory. Thus, he felt no need to depend upon God. This caused him to become compromised in his walk. He decided to incorporate the Edomite idols into his worship. Yet, this was both offensive to God and in violation of the First and Second Commandments. Out of mercy and grace, God sent a prophet to warned him. Amaziah, however, did not take this warning seriously. Because his heart was hardened, Amaziah instead threatened God’s prophet: “<em>‘Have we appointed you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?’”</em> (2 Chr. 25:16). But in Amaziah’s judgement of God’s prophet, he cast judgment upon himself. “For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.” (Matt. 7:2).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Failing to listen to God’s counsel will allow your heart to grow hard to sin</span>. David had Nathan to convict him of his sins (2 Sam. 12:1-12). After Nathan confronted him, David listened and repented (2 Sam. 12:13). Although Amaziah initially listened to God’s prophet, he now took counsel from only himself. “You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;” (Dt. 12:8). If you are not in an accountability relationship, you may also drift from God in your walk.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Without vigilance, fellowship can be quickly broken</span>. Amaziah made the same mistake as his father. Joash was initially obedient in rooting out idolatry (2 Chr. 24:1-14). But following the death of the High Priest Jehoiada, he and his advisors drifted back into idol worship. In his success, Joash was also no longer willing to listen to God’s prophets: “<sup><em>17</em></sup> But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them. <sup>18 </sup>They abandoned the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt. <sup>19 </sup>Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; though they testified against them, they would not listen.” (2 Chr. 24:17-19). These examples show that you will stay trapped in a cycle of sin unless you learn to be vigilant in guarding your heart. You should never allow your spiritual successes to cause you to become complacent in your walk. If you do, Satan will try to take advantage of you. “Be of sober <em>spirit</em>, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. <sup>9 </sup>But resist him, firm in <em>your</em> faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. <sup>10 </sup>After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen <em>and</em> establish you.” (1 Pet. 5:8-10). Who are you accountable to in order to stay vigilant in your walk? Are you also keeping yourself out of environments where you might turn to sin?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If you desire your old life, Satan will try to pull you back into it</span>. These Jews liked having different idols to pray to. They most likely believed that their prayers were more likely to succeed if they could pray to multiple gods. Yet, this diversity of worship was offensive to God. If you desire for your old life of the flesh, Satan will use that to pull you away from Jesus. And, you will grow cold toward Jesus: “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” (Lk. 9:62). Do you long for any aspects of your old life when you lived according to the desires of the flesh?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <span class="underline">Humility: A Good Leader is Humble and Led by the Holy Spirit</span>. 2 Chr. 25:17-19.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoash warns Amaziah not to start a war out of pride, but Amaziah refuses to listen</span>. God had not counseled Amaziah to wage war against Northern Israel. Yet, he was blinded by his pride. Thus, he would not listen to warnings to stand down from his threats of war: “<sup>17 </sup><em>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, ‘Come, let us face each other.’ <sup>18 </sup>Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, ‘The thorn bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trampled the thorn bush. <sup>19 </sup>You said, ‘Behold, you have defeated Edom.’ And your heart has become proud in boasting. Now stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you, even you, would fall and Judah with you?</em>’” (2 Chr. 25:17-19; 2 Kgs. 14:8-11). In his parable, Jehoash depicted Amaziah as a thistle to symbolize his weaker power. Amaziah was foolish to feel pride merely because he defeated the small desert nation of Edom. In contrast, Jehoash depicted himself as the cedar, which had defeated the far more mighty opponent in Syria (2 Chr. 25:18; 2 Kgs. 13:25). The mercenaries from Northern Israel had already looted parts of Judah (2 Chr. 25:6-10, 13). Jehoash warned that his battle-tested armies from the ten tribes of Northern Israel would defeat the two tribes of Judah like a mighty wild beast crushing a lowly bush if Judah attacked. Both parties in this dispute were governed by their pride. Both also failed to give God credit for their victories. Yet, Amaziah carried the greater sin as the aggressor in this war.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah’s pride turned his heart against God</span>. Amaziah’s pride in taking credit for his victory was another part of his spiritual compromise. He became angry when the mercenaries from Northern Israel raided Judah: “But the troops whom Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 of them and plundered much spoil.” (2 Chr. 25:13) In his pride, he threatened Northern Israel with war unless it submitted to him. Even though Northern Israel had 10 tribes and more people, its wars with Syria had reduced its strength: “For he left to Jehoahaz of the army not more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and 10,000 footmen, for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.” (2 Kgs. 13:25). And Amaziah had assembled 300,000 soldiers against Edom (2 Chr. 25:5, 11-12). He trusted in his own strength and believed that he would prevail. Yet, he did not turn to God for guidance regarding whether he should go to war. As a result of his spiritual blindness, he could not see that God had granted him victory of Edom. He did not realize that he was powerless trying to fight without God.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Do not trust in his own strength or understanding in battle</span>. Although Amaziah could not see it, God was solely responsible for his prior victory: “For by their own sword they did not possess the land, and their own arm did not save them, but Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence, for You favored them.” (Ps. 44:3). “and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’S and He will give you into our hands.” (1 Sam. 17:47). “Some boast in chariots and some in horses, but we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not delivered by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Do you trust in God or your own abilities to prevail in your conflicts?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">The Fear of God: A Good Leader Fears God by Hating Evil</span>. 2 Chr. 25:20-24.</p>

<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoash defeats Amaziah and loots God’s Temple</span>. Because Amaziah refused to back down from his prideful threats against Northern Israel, God allowed Northern Israel to defeat Judah and even loot the gold from His Temple: “<sup>20 </sup><em>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom. <sup>21 </sup>So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah. <sup>22 </sup>Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled each to his tent. <sup>23 </sup>Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. <sup>24 </sup>He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:20-24; 2 Kgs. 14:12-16). Amaziah paid dearly for his pride. He lost his freedom and his treasuries of gold (2 Chron. 25:23-25). He remained a prisoner in Samaria until King Jehoash died, circa 782 B.C. (2 Kgs. 14:17). His people also suffered. King Jehoash had his armies rip down the walls that protected Jerusalem. His troops looted the city and took people hostage. He even looted the holy things that existed inside of God’s Temple. Much of the gold had only recently been replenished. King Joash, the prior king, had previously used the Temple gold to bribe King Hazael of Damascus not to attack Judah (2 Kgs. 12:17-18).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God judged Amaziah for his pride</span>. Through his pride, Amaziah committed one of the sins that God “hates”: “ . . . pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). Because Amaziah exalted himself, God humbled him. “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12). “When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, and the humble person He will save.” (Job 22:29). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’” (Jam. 4:6). Because Amaziah’s pride would not let him repent, it led to his defeat and later his death: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18). “A man’s pride will bring him low, . . .” (Prov. 29:23). His pride deceived him into thinking that he was responsible for God’s victory over Edom: ‘“ . . . The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,’ . . . declares the LORD.” (Jer. 49:16). Like Amaziah, when you are prideful, your heart will also deceive you into doing foolish things.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God also judged Amaziah because of his idolatry</span>. God also judged Amaziah for his disobedience and idolatry in worshiping the gods of Edom: “But Amaziah would not listen, <em>for it was from God, that He might deliver them into the hand of Joash because they had sought the gods of Edom</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:20). God did not allow Amaziah’s idolatry to revoke God’s eternal covenant with David (2 Sam. 7:12-13). Yet, God still disciplined Amaziah for his acts: “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,” (2 Sam. 7:14). God was faithful to fulfill this promise to David.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah’s defeat was predicted under God’s law</span>. Amaziah’s troops could not even put up a fight. Instead, “<em>they fled each to his tent.</em>” (2 Chr. 25:22; Kgs. 14:12). Amaziah did not need a prophet to tell him that he would be defeated with his troops fleeing in terror if he disobeyed God and fought a war against God’s people without His consent. Through Moses, God warned that His people would be defeated in battle with their troops fleeing if they disobeyed Him: “<sup>25 </sup><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shall cause you to be defeated before your enemies</em>; you will go out one way against them, but <em>you will flee seven ways before them</em>, and you will be <em>an example of</em> terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.” (Dt. 28:25). “I will set My face against you so that <em>you will be struck down before your enemies</em>; and those who hate you will rule over you, and <em>you will flee when no one is pursuing you</em>.” (Lev. 26:17) The Jews had also experienced this on a number of occasions when they turned against God. For example, when they misused the Ark and tried to fight the Philistines while disobeying God, the Jews also fled from the fight and lost: “So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the slaughter was very great, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.” (1 Sam. 4:10). When you disobey God, He will not forsake you (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5). Yet, He may discipline you.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Fear God by hating evil</span>. Like many believers, Amaziah did not take God’s warnings seriously. He found out when it was too late that there were consequences for his actions. The beginning of all knowledge is the fear of God (Prov. 1:7). The Bible defines the fear of God as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:13). Are you ignoring or condoning evil in your life?</p></li>

<p>7. <span class="underline">Repentance: A Good Leader Repents and Restores the Injured</span>. 2 Chr. 25:25-28.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Jews kill King Amaziah and appoint his son Azariah (Uzziah) as King of Judah</span>. Following Jehoash’s death, Amaziah was allowed to return to Judah where he served out his final 15 years as a weakened king. In the end, his own people hated him enough to conspire together and kill him: “<sup>25 </sup><em>And Amaziah, the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. <sup>26 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel? <sup>27 </sup>From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. <sup>28 </sup>Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:25-28; 2 Kgs. 14:17-22). Although not stated in the text, Jeroboam II appears to have released Amaziah from prison after Jehoash died (2 Chr. 25:25). Following King Joash (Jehoash)’s disobedience towards God, God lifted His hand of protection, and he died as a result of an assassination (2 Kgs. 12:21). Amaziah had 15 years to repent and turn to God after his return, 782-767 B.C. Because he failed to do so, he shared his father’s fate.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Amaziah sought and failed to find refuge in a city of idolatry</span>. Amaziah lived out his final 15 years hated by his people for the pain he caused them. We can assume that the King of Northern Israel educated the people of Judah that Amaziah provoked the unnecessary war and was even given an opportunity to back down. When the conspiracy became known to Amaziah, he “<em>fled to Lachish</em>.” (2 Chr. 25:27; 2 Kgs. 14:19). This was the place where idolatry began in Judah: “Harness the chariot to the team of horses, o inhabitant of <em>Lachish</em>-- <em>she was the beginning of sin</em> <em>to the daughter of Zion</em>-- because in you were found the rebellious acts of Israel.” (Mic. 1:13). In other words, Amaziah sought refuge with the people who also practiced idolatry instead of trusting God. But he found no refuge in either his idols or the people who practiced idolatry.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Azariah (Uzziah) refused to follow in his father’s idol worship</span>. Following Amaziah’s death, Azariah (also referred to as Uzziah (2 Chr. 26:1; Isa. 1:1)) succeeded him. Although he may have served as a regent while his father was in jail, his reign began in 767 B.C. (2 Chr. 26:1-23; 2 Kgs. 15:1). He was a reformer who refused to follow his father’s mistakes. He rebuilt the port city of Elath on the northern coast of the Gulf of Aqabah. This was an important city during Solomon’s reign (1 Kgs. 9:26-28; 10:22), and Jehoshaphat’s reign (2 Chr. 20:36). Azariah (Uzziah) also trusted God and succeed in many other aspects of his administration as King of Judah (2 Chr. 26:6-15).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Respond to God’s mercy and grace by repenting of your sins</span>. Amaziah refused to use either his time in jail or his last 15 years as king to repent and restore those that he hurt. Jesus called upon the people He met to repent and return to Him before they would experience His mercy and grace: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 3:2; 4:17; Mk. 1:15). “Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;” (Acts 3:19). “For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.” (Ps. 51:1). David was a sinner in God’s eyes. Yet, what made David different was his willingness to come back to God when he sinned.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If you confess your sins, Jesus will forgive you</span>. During Old Testament times, when a believer became aware of their sins, the believer was required to make a “guilt” offering (Lev. 5:5-13). Today, you do not need to make a physical sacrifice to be forgiven. Jesus did that for you on the cross (1 Jo 2:2). He further promises to forgive you if you will confess your sins: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). Will you confess your sins when the Holy Spirit reveals them to you?</p></li>
