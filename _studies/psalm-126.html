<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the seventh Song of Ascent (Ps. 120–134). Matthew Henry observes that this psalm is most likely a psalm of gratitude in Ezra’s time following the Jews’ deliverance from Babylonian captivity. “It was with reference to some great and surprising deliverance of the people of God out of bondage and distress that this psalm was penned, most likely their return out of Babylon in Ezra’s time. Though Babylon be not mentioned here (as it is, Ps 137) yet their captivity there was the most remarkable captivity both in itself and as their return out of it was typical of our redemption by Christ. Probably this psalm was penned by Ezra, or some of the prophets that came up with the first.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 126).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> God’s deliverance of Israel was a miraculous work and a testament to His faithfulness. But God’s redemptive work was not completed with the Jews’ freedom from captivity. Israel’s restoration remains an ongoing work. Here, through the psalmist’s prayer for the full restoration of Israel, God reveals seven lessons on spiritual revival. To succeed, spiritual revival includes: (1) God’s deliverance, (2) gratitude for God’s mercy and grace, (3) praise, (4) joy, (5) the Holy Spirit, (6) perseverance, and (7) service.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist began his praise by celebrating God’s deliverance of the Jews from captivity. Before any revival can begin, God first delivers His people from spiritual bondage. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist said that the people looked at their freedom as if they were in a dream. The psalmist realized that their deliverance was a miracle and a testament to God’s mercy and grace. Revival also requires gratitude for God’s miraculous mercy and grace. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist stated that the pagan nations would respond to the Jews’ joyful laughter and praise by recognizing God’s hand in the Jews’ deliverance. Revival should also include public praise for God’s works. This is a form of evangelism. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist proclaimed the Jews’ joy related to God’s works. Revival should also include joy in your walk with God. In addition to reflecting your appreciation towards God, it also sends a powerful message to nonbelievers. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist asked for God’s to restore the Jews’ fortunes like a desert flash flood. Through this metaphor, God reveals that revival is in part brought about through the instantaneous, transformative power of the Holy Spirit. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist declared that those who sow tears of sorrow through their labors will reap tears of joy. Through this metaphor, God reveals that a revival also requires perseverance for it to endure. Faithful service to God will ultimately bring joy to the believers for his or her labors. <u>Finally</u>, through another metaphor related to agricultural work, the psalmist revealed that a life of serving God will bring the believer joy. Here, God reveals that revival should be evidenced through a lifetime of service, devotion, and tithing to further His kingdom. God will reward a lifetime of service and giving with the joy and peace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 id="deliverance-before-revival-god-first-delivers-from-bondage.-ps.-1261a.">1. <u>Deliverance: Before Revival, God First Delivers from Bondage</u>. Ps. 126:1a.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Revival begins with Jesus’ redemptive work in releasing you from spiritual bondage</u>. The psalmist began by acknowledging that it was God’s sovereign will that released Israel from bondage. “<strong><sup>1a</sup></strong> <em>When the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> brought back the captives of Zion,..</em>.” (Ps. 126:1a). “No doubt the restoration from exile in Babylon is meant, whether the literal meaning of the phrase is <em>to bring back the captivity</em>, or <em>to turn the fortunes</em>, i.e. restore the prosperity, of Zion.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on P. 126:1a).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>To demonstrate His power and to give His people hope, God promised to free the Jews</u>. Before the Jews even entered the Promised Land, God promised through Moses that He would free His people from a future, foreign captivity. “[T]hen the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.” (Dt. 30:3). To encourage the Jews, God later sent other prophets who repeated His promises to free the Jews. “[B]ut, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up and led the descendants of the household of Israel back from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will live on their own soil.” (Jer. 23:8). “For behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The LORD says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take possession of it.’” (Jer. 30:3). “I will also restore the fortunes of My people Israel, and they will rebuild the desolated cities and live in them; they will also plant vineyards and drink their wine, and make gardens and eat their fruit.” (Amos 9:14). God’s deliverance of the Jews showed that He is faithful to keep His promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God used King Cyrus II to deliver the Jews</u>. To show the Jews that they were spiritual bondage, God allowed them to experience physical bondage. Yet, out of mercy and grace, God did not forsake His people. He instead used the Persians to free the Jews from Babylonian bondage (2 Chr. 36:22-23). In 559 B.C., Cyrus II (the “Great”) became King of Persia (550-530 B.C.), which then existed in south-eastern Iran and the Iranian coastline of the Persian Gulf. Nine years later, he conquered Medes, located in western Iran and the southern Caspian Sea, and he created a unified Medo-Persian Empire. Yet, at that time, it was called the Achaemenid Empire after Persia’s first king. In 539 B.C., to fulfill God’s prophecies, God empowered the Medo-Persian army to capture Babylon. Cyrus II’s general Gobryas diverted the Euphrates River. This caused the water level around Babylon to drop and allowed his troops to take Babylon by surprise. Just before this attack, the prophet Daniel told the Babylonian King Belshazzar that God had judged him (Dan 5:5-31). Daniel then became an advisor to the Persians. By some traditions, he showed the Persians the many prophecies predicting Cyrus II’s future conquests. In 538 B.C., the Holy Spirit moved in King Cyrus II’s heart, and he made a decree that gave the Jewish captives in Babylon the right to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple (Ezra 1:1-4; 5:13-17). Possibly after having seen the Jewish prophecies, King Cyrus II further understood God’s divine providence in giving him his kingdom and his obligation to rebuild the Temple (Is. 44:28-45:4). Sheshbazzar then led the first wave of faithful Jews from Babylonian captivity to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:11).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> God was faithful to deliver His people as soon as He had removed their pagan idolatry. ‘“Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, now I will arise,’ says the LORD; ‘I will put him in the safety for which he longs.”’ (Ps. 12:5).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus came to set you free from spiritual bondage</u>. Like the Jews in Babylon, every person is in spiritual bondage to sin without Jesus. But Jesus came to set believers free. “The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, because He anointed Me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent Me to proclaim release to captives, and recover of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed, to proclaim the favorable year of the LORD.” (Lk. 4:18-19). Are you regularly crediting God with your deliverance from spiritual bondage?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gratitude-revival-requires-gratitude-for-gods-mercy-and-grace.-ps.-1261b.">2. <u>Gratitude: Revival Requires Gratitude for God’s Mercy and Grace</u>. Ps. 126:1b.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s mercy and grace is greater than anything you can imagine</u>. The psalmist recognized that the Jews did not deserve God’s mercy and grace. Thus, he stated that the Jews felt as if they were dreaming when God freed them. “<strong><sup>1b</sup></strong> <em>… we were like those who dream</em>.” (Ps. 126:1b). “The Latin Vulgate and the Septuagint render this, ‘we were comforted.’ The meaning is, ‘It seemed like a dream; we could hardly realize that it was so; it was so marvelous, so good, so full of joy, that we could scarcely believe it was real.’ This state of mind is not uncommon, when, in sudden and overpowering joy, we ask whether it can be real; whether it is not all a dream. We fear that it is; we apprehend that it will all vanish away like a dream.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 126:1b).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Peter was also so amazed by his deliverance that he thought he was dreaming. “And he [Peter] went out and continued to follow, and yet he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.” (Acts 12:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rival requires gratitude, or you will take God for granted</u>. As our example, the psalmists regularly gave God the credit for their deliverance. “For the music director. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. LORD, You showed favor to Your land; You restored the fortunes of Jacob.” (Ps. 85:1). “I sought the LORD and He answered me, and rescued me from all my fears … This wretched man cried out, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.” (Ps. 34:4, 6). “For He has saved me from all trouble, and my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies.” (Ps. 54:7).</p></li>

<p>Let the joy of your transformation be part of your testimony to nonbelievers<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that Jesus delivered you from bondage to sin and eternal death</u>. When you get to heaven, you will also feel as though you are dreaming. Every person in heaven will recognize how undeserving they are of their salvation and turn to Jesus with praise. But you should not wait until you get to heaven to give thanks. At all times, you should give thanks for your deliverance. “[I]n everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20). Do you treat your deliverance as a dream come true? If not, your spiritual revival may slowly fade away.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="praise-revival-should-include-public-praise-for-gods-works.-ps.-1262.">3. <u>Praise: Revival Should Include Public Praise For God’s Works</u>. Ps. 126:2.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let your joy related to God’s deliverance be evident for everyone to see</u>. The psalmist declared that the Jews were filled with so much joyful praise for God that even the pagan nations saw God’s redemptive power. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with joyful shouting; then they said among the nations, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has done great things for them</em>.”’ (Ps. 126:2). “The joy of those returned from Babylon was ecstatic, and elicited the admiration even of the heathen, as illustrating God’s great power and goodness.” (Jamieson-Faussett-Brown Bible Commentary on Ps. 126:1-3).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> “The Orientals weep when they are disappointed, and, when they are pleased, laugh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm">Job 8:21</a>) and shout for joy (Herod., 8:99).” (Pulpit Commentary Ps. 126:2).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The psalmists regularly praised God for His miraculous redemptive power</u>. As our example, the psalmists regularly praised God before the gentiles for their undeserved salvation. “Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation; then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.” (Ps. 51:14). “My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your glory all day long … For Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, You who have done great things; God, who is like You?” (Ps. 71:8, 19). (Ps. 71:8). “My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:21). “And my tongue shall proclaim Your righteousness and Your praise all day long.” (Ps. 35:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus before nonbelievers as part of your testimony of your deliverance</u>. The psalmists and the prophets all recognized the importance of praising God’s deliverance before the gentiles. “That Your way may be known on the earth, Your salvation among all nations.” (Ps. 67:2). “The LORD has made His salvation known; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.” (Ps. 98:2). “The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, so that all the ends of the earth may see the salvation of our God.” (Is. 52:10). Are you praising Jesus for deliverance before nonbelievers?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joy-revival-should-include-joy-in-your-walk-with-god.-ps.-1263.">4. <u>Joy: Revival Should Include Joy in Your Walk With God</u>. Ps. 126:3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you walk with God, He offers the blessings of the joy of the Holy Spirit</u>. The psalmist proclaimed that the Jews were filled with joy as a result of their deliverance from captivity. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has done great things for us; we are joyful</em>.” (Ps. 126:3). “To capture the intensity of this passage one must imagine what it would have been like to have lived in Babylonian captivity and not have been free or able to worship in the way the nation had been accustomed to before, and then imagine what it would have been like to be free to go once again to Jerusalem for the festivals.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 126).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s prophets foretold the joy that would come from the Jews’ freedom</u>. Before the Jews’ release from captivity, the prophets promised that their deliverance would be a joyful occasion. “And it will be said on that day, ‘Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited; let’s rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”’ (Is. 25:9). “Do not fear, land; shout for joy and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things.” (Joel 2:21). “Shout for joy, daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, Israel! Rejoice and triumph with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem!” (Zeph. 3:14). The psalmists also declared that the people would shout for joy to celebrate their salvation. “Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.” (Ps. 14:7). “Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, Israel shall be glad. (Ps. 53:6).</p></li>

<p>The joy of the Holy Spirit should be a testament to your spiritual revival<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let the joy of the Holy Spirit be part of your testimony to nonbelievers</u>. When nonbelievers see you, the joy of the Holy Spirit should be evident in your life. “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Gal. 5:22). “for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” (Ro. 14:17). Your joy should attract non-believers to Jesus. Is the fruit of the Spirit evident for others to see? “You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?” (Matt. 7:16). If the joy of your deliverance has faded, your spiritual revival may also fade.</p></li>

<h2 id="the-holy-spirit-revival-is-in-part-brought-about-through-the-instantaneous-transformative-power-of-the-holy-spirit.-ps.-1264.">5. <u>The Holy Spirit: Revival is in Part Brought About Through the</u> <u>Instantaneous, Transformative Power of the Holy Spirit</u>. Ps. 126:4.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through the Holy Spirit, God can instantly transform you</u>. With the Jews still under the control of Persia, the psalmist prayed for God to fully restore Israel as fast as a flash flood in the Negev desert. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Restore our fortunes, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, as the streams in the South</em>.” (Ps. 126:4). “The second half of this psalm does not deny the amazed joy of the first half, but it recognizes that there is still work yet to be done. The returning exiles (under Ezra or David) realized there was much work yet to do, and the restoration had only yet begun…The <strong>streams in the South</strong> flowed when the rain fell in faraway mountains. Those <strong>streams</strong> could appear suddenly and rush with a mighty flow, sometimes known as <em>flash floods</em>. The psalmist prayed for a mighty, sudden work of God to further the work of restoration among His people. (David Guzik on Ps. 126) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God promised to transform His people in an instant, like a desert flash flood</u>. In a foreshadow of the Holy Spirit, God promised to transform His people with the rivers of life as quickly as a river appearing in a desert following a rain storm. “Behold, I am going to do something new, now it will spring up; will you not be aware of it? I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.” (Is. 43:19). “Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.” (Ezek. 36:26). “I will also give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me wholeheartedly.” (Jer. 24:17). “Then those who limp will leap like a deer, and the tongue of those who cannot speak will shout for joy. For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.” (Is. 35:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the water of life who will instantly transform you</u>. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He offers you the water of eternal life. “Therefore you will joyously draw water from the springs of salvation.” (Is. 12:3). “Jesus replied to her, ‘If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.’ … but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”’ (Jo. 4:10, 14). The waters of life that He offers will also burst forth from your life like a river. “The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.”’ (Jo. 7:38). Jesus will transform you by filling you with the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus can instantly transform you by making you a new creation</u>. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you instantly become a new creation. “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Cor. 5:17). This process is instantaneous, like a flash flood. At the moment of your salvation, the Holy Spirit fills you and transforms you to become a new creation. But each person must make an effort to continue to live as a new creation (Ro. 6:4).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="perseverance-revival-requires-perseverance-for-it-to-endure.-ps.-1265.">6. <u>Perseverance: Revival Requires Perseverance For It To Endure</u>. Ps. 126:5.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Your redemption should be followed by a lifetime of diligence in serving God</u>. Although a part of the Jews’ redemption would be instantaneous, the psalmist recognized that it would be followed by hard work. But if they persevered, God would fill them with His joy. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Those who sow in tears shall harvest with joyful shouting</em>.” (Ps. 126:5). “Hence, present distress must not be viewed as if it would last forever; it is not the end, by any means, but only a means to the end. Sorrow is our sowing, rejoicing shall be our reaping. If there were no sowing in tears there would be no reaping in joy. If we were never captives we could never lead our captivity captive.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 126:5).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews who returned to Jerusalem from captivity had to persevere in the face of attacks</u>. As soon as the returning began rebuilding the Temple, the devil stirred up a Persian governor to make inquiries and potentially stop the building process. Yet, because the Jews persevered in faith, God ensured that the building process continued: “<sup>3 </sup>At that time Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, ‘Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?’ <sup>4 </sup>Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were reconstructing this building. <sup>5 </sup>But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a written reply be returned concerning it.” (Ezra 5:3-5). Tattenai was the Persian governor responsible for the territory west of the “River”. This referenced the Persian territory from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. Shethar-boznai, his assistant, and his colleagues most likely acted in response to new complaints from the elders in Samaria and other Jewish opponents. Yet, unlike other leaders, Tattenai made inquiries without a hatred toward the Jews. Thus, God influenced him to allow the building to continue while he sent an official inquiry to King Darius I. Like the Jews, the devil will also try to stop you when you step out in faith to serve Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you diligently serve God during times of sorrow, He will strengthen you</u>. To encourage the Jews, the prophets promised that God would renew them if they persevered in their faith. “Yet those who wait for the LORD will gain new strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.” (Is. 40:31). “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.” (Is. 51:11). “A wicked person earns deceptive wages, but one who sows righteousness gets a true reward.” (Prov. 11:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>If you persevere in your faith, you will reap the joy of the Holy Spirit</u>. The Holy Spirit will also reward you with joy when you are diligent in serving God. “Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.” (Gal. 6:9). “Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be firm, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58). “With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be alert with all perseverance and every request for all the saints,” (Eph. 6:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God use your trials to build up the perseverance of your faith</u>. God tested the Jews with these trials so that they would learn to place their faith in Him. Your trials should also produce perseverance and endurance: “And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;” (Ro. 5:3). “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.” (Jam. 1:2-3). Paul faced a harder trial when he faced death in Asia. But he advised that God put him through trials so that he would rely upon Him and not his own strength: “<sup>8 </sup>For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; <sup>9 </sup>indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; . . . He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,” (2 Cor. 1:8-10). Are you turning to Jesus to build up your faith so that you can persevere in the face of trials? If not, any revival in your life may fade or fall away in the face of adversity or trials.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to reward those who respond to the gift of salvation with grateful service</u>. If done for the right reasons, God will reward your service and tithing. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>One who goes here and there weeping, carrying his bag of seed, shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him</em>.” (Ps. 125:6). “The psalm closes in verses 5-6 confidently asserting that those who suffer for remaining true to Yahweh will eventually rejoice when he establishes his word.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 126:5-6).”<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> “Our attitude in ministry is vitally important. God has taken His glorious treasure, the ‘seed,’ and put it in earthen pots, us. God wants us to pour forth His love to the needy world around us so they're captivated by Him, not by us.” (Chuck Smith on Ps. 126:5-6).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Those who sow seeds in service to God are more likely to see their revivals endure<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Show your appreciation for your salvation through your service and tithing to God</u>. To show their gratitude for their unearned redemption, Moses urged Israel to serve God with all their heart and soul: “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to <em>serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul</em>,” (Dt. 10:12). Joshua gave a similar exhortation. “Now, therefore, fear the LORD and <em>serve Him</em> in sincerity and truth; and do away with the gods which your fathers served beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.” (Josh. 24:14). In his farewell address, Samuel also implored the Jews to show their love for God through their service. “If you will fear the LORD and <em>serve Him</em>, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the command of the LORD, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God. . . Only fear the LORD and <em>serve Him</em> in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.” (1 Sam. 12:14, 24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>With gratitude, be a co-builder of His Kingdom by giving from what God has given you</u>. During the first exodus, the Jews gave freely to help build the Tabernacle (Ex. 25:2-9; 35:21-29). During this second exodus, the Jews again “offered willingly for the house of God to restore it.” (Ezra 2:68). They also gave “according to their ability.” (Ezra 2:69). Just as all had to work together then to rebuild the Temple, God calls on every believer today to be a co-builder of God’s Church (1 Cor. 3:9). Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from above, even if someone in the world hands it to you (Jam. 1:17). God commands each believer to give back from the things that He has given. He in turn promises to bless you as a steward with more gifts (Mal. 3:8-10). But He only wants you to give out of gratitude, not obligation (Ex. 36:2-7; 2 Cor. 9:6, 8-14). Are you giving to God from what He has given you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will give back in proportion to your giving</u>. To the extent you give to God, He will give back proportionally to you: “Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <sup>7 </sup>Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:6-7). “And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings. <sup>10 </sup>“He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. <sup>11 </sup>Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?” (Lk. 16:9-11). Are you giving Jesus your time, talent, and treasure?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Serving God fulfills your highest calling</u>. God has called every believer by name before the foundation of the world to do good works for Him: “For we are His workmanship, <em>created in Christ Jesus for good works</em>, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10). “Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, <em>prepared for every good work</em>.” (2 Tim. 2:21). How are you fulfilling your calling for His “good works”?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When times are tough, test God by giving to Him</u>. Giving is the one area where God encourages you to test Him. If you give to Him in faith, He promises to bless you with even more (Mal. 3:8-10). Are you giving God the opportunity to bless you abundantly?</p></li>
