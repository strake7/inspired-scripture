<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 72 concludes the second of the five books of the Psalms.  Here, Solomon prayed for the wisdom to be a just ruler (1 Kgs. 3:5-14). But Psalm 72 is also best understood as a prophesy about Jesus, the promised Messiah and King of Kings (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14; 19:16). Jesus also made clear that He came to fulfill the Psalms: “Now He said to them, “these are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and <em>the Psalms must be fulfilled</em>.” (Lk. 24:44). Here, the Bible reveals seven reasons to praise Jesus as your King of Kings. Jesus rules with: (1) justice, (2) deliverance, (3) peace, (4) sovereignty, (5) compassion, (6) provision, and (7) glory.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon prayed for wisdom to a just ruler. Jesus is the source of wisdom and justice. He deserves your praise because He is a just and wise King of Kings. <u>Second</u>, Solomon prayed for the ability to deliver God’s people from oppression. True deliverance also comes from Jesus. He deserves your praise because He can deliver you from any bondage to sin. <u>Third</u>, Solomon then prayed for the promised Messiah and prayed for a future of everlasting peace. This also foreshadowed Jesus. He is the source of true peace, and He offers to let you share in His eternal reign of peace. <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon again prayed for the Messiah, whose reign will encompass all the Earth. This again foreshadowed Jesus. He deserves your praise because He is sovereign over evil, and He uses His power for good. <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon prayed for the Messiah, who will rule with love and compassion. Jesus again deserves your praise because He rules with love and compassion. <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon praised the Messiah, who will forever provide for His people. Jesus again deserves your praise because He provides for you. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon gave thanks for God’s glorious name. Jesus again deserves your praise for sharing His Shekinah glory with you.</p>
<h2 id="justice-praise-jesus-as-your-just-and-wise-king-of-kings.-ps.-721-3."><strong>1. <u>Justice: Praise Jesus as Your Just and Wise King of Kings</u>. Ps. 72:1-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for God’s wisdom to be a just ruler</u>. Solomon began by praying for God to give His wisdom to rule over Israel with God’s justice and righteousness: “<em>The Reign of the Righteous King. A Psalm of Solomon. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Give the king Your judgments, God, and Your righteousness to the king’s son. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong> May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice. <strong><sup>3</sup></strong> May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills, in righteousness</em>.” (Ps. 72:1-3). Like Solomon, every leader should turn to God for wisdom (1 Kgs. 3:5-14). Jesus makes His wisdom known through His Word and prayer.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God gave Solomon the wisdom to be a just ruler because he asked for it in humility</u>. Before asking for wisdom from God, Solomon showed reverence to God by recognizing the “mercy” that God showed to his father, King David (1 Kgs. 3:6).  Even though he was the youngest of David’s children and the son of an adulterous marriage, it was God’s will that Solomon would be the next king.  God then made that happen.  In humility, Solomon recognized his lack of qualifications and training to be king: “<em>I am but a little child”</em>  (1 Kgs. 3:7; 1 Chr. 22:5; 29:1).  Because Solomon was already married and a father at age 20 (1 Kgs. 14:21), this was a reference to his lack of experience, not his age.  He conceded that he could not lead the 12 rebellious tribes without God’s help. Thus, he asked for the wisdom to be a just ruler: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is capable of judging this great people of Yours?</em>” (1 Kgs. 3:9). God understood Solomon’s prayer as a request for “<em>discernment to understand justice</em>,” which He granted. (1 Kgs. 3:11-12). Jesus makes the same offer to share in His wisdom when you study His Word and pray for guidance.</p></li>

<p>Govert Flinck (1615-1660) “Solomon asks for wisdom” (1 Kgs. 3:5-14) (painting 1658)<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon’s wisdom came from Jesus, the true source of any ruler’s wisdom</u>.  Solomon later praised God as the source of true wisdom:  “For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.”  (Prov. 2:6).  Before his death, David also paid tribute to God: “He who rules over men righteously” (2 Sam. 23:3).  For a time in his life, David followed the King of Kings and ruled righteously:  “So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people.”  (2 Sam. 8:15).  Like David and Solomon, rulers must turn to the King of Kings, the true source of righteousness, for wisdom in ruling:  “Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5).  Like Solomon, Jesus wants you to pray for His wisdom and study His Word so He can guide you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8).  “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30).  “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Spirit of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding</em> . . . <em>with righteousness He will judge</em> the poor, and decide with fairness for the humble of the earth; . . . <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.” (Is. 11:1-5). “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with <em>justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore</em>.”  (Is. 9:7; 16:5).  “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  His righteous reign is another reason to praise Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is also free when you ask for it</u>.  Jesus is also ready to pour out His wisdom freely when you ask for it for the right reasons:  “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.”  (Ja. 1:5).  “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.”  (Ps. 51:6).  Are you seeking His wisdom?</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-praise-jesus-as-your-deliverer-from-bondage-to-sin.-ps.-724-6."><strong>2. <u>Deliverance: Praise Jesus as Your Deliverer From Bondage to Sin</u>. Ps. 72:4-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for the ability to execute God’s justice and deliver His people</u>. Solomon prayed for the ability to deliver those in need from physical and monetary oppression: “<strong><sup>4</sup></strong> <em>May he vindicate the afflicted of the people, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor. <strong><sup>5</sup></strong> May they fear You while the sun shines, and as long as the moon shines, throughout all generations. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, like showers that water the earth</em>.” (Ps. 72:1-3). This also prophetically pointed to Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon learned that lasting deliverance required the fear of God</u>. Solomon prayed: “<em><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> May they fear You while the sun shines, and as long as the moon shines, throughout all generations.</em>” (Ps. 72:5). Through his many mistakes, he learned that God’s wisdom required fearing Him: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 2:5). “The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person.” (Ecc. 12:13; Ps. 111:10; 1 Sam. 12:24). Solomon defined the fear of the Lord as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:13). Solomon was the wisest and richest man to ever live (1 Kgs. 3:12, 4:30; 10:23). “I said to myself, ‘Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”’ (Ecc. 1:16). Yet, without the fear of God, his wisdom, knowledge, and wealth did not prevent him from descending into covetousness, rebellion and idolatry. His life is a warning to all believers. Unless you cling to Jesus, knowledge, wisdom, and wealth cannot save you from drifting in your walk from Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus as your deliverer</u>.  Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would bring good news and deliver God’s people: “The Spirit of the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> is upon me, because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> anointed me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners;” (Is. 61:1). Jesus quoted from this prophesy to reveal that it referred to Him (Lk. 4:17-18; Matt. 11:4-5). David also prophesied that the Messiah who would free the oppressed: “You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.’” (Ps. 2:9). The New Testament confirms that David was referring to Jesus: “And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are shattered, as I also have received authority from My Father;” (Rev. 2:27). Jesus will one day come to judge evil: “Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;” (2 Thess. 2:8). “From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.” (Rev. 19:15). Jesus again deserves your praise for delivering you from evil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His protection</u>.  Jesus is also your rock.  He also deserves your praise for His protection from your enemies:  “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,”  (2 Sam. 22:47).  “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my savior, You save me from violence.”  (2 Sam. 22:3).  “The Rock!  His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He.” (Dt. 32:4).  “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2, 31, 46; 19:14).  Do you praise Jesus for His protection in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because His deliverance leads to eternal life</u>. Solomon prayed: “<em><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, like showers that water the earth</em>.” (Ps. 72:6). This referred to Moses’ statement that God’s Word would bring life, like the life-giving rain in the dry desert: “May my teaching drip as the rain, My speech trickle as the dew, as droplets on the fresh grass, and as the showers on the vegetation.” (Dt. 32:2). “I will be like the dew to Israel; . . .” (Hosea 14:5). Jesus, the Word incarnate, brings eternal life: “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there without watering the earth and making it produce and sprout, and providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;” (Is. 55:10). “The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.” (Jo. 7:38). This also referred to the abundant life through the Holy Spirit: “‘For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring, and My blessing on your descendants;” (Is. 44:3; 55:10). Jesus again deserves praise.</p></li>

<h2 id="peace-praise-jesus-for-his-promised-eternal-reign-of-peace.-ps.-727."><strong>3. <u>Peace: Praise Jesus for His Promised Eternal Reign of Peace</u>. Ps. 72:7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for the Messiah’s reign of peace</u>. Solomon then turned to the promised Messiah and prayed for a future everlasting peace that no man could provide: “<strong><sup>7</sup></strong> <em>May the righteous flourish in his days, as well as an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more</em>.” (Ps. 72:7). Solomon sought the ability to bring righteous peace: “And the work of righteousness will be peace, and the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.” (Is. 32:17). But he spoke of an everlasting peace that only God can provide.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon sought God’s peace</u>. Solomon previously prayed: “<em><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills, in righteousness</em>.” (Ps. 72:3). Here, he prayed for “<em>the righteous flourish in his days</em>” in “<em>abundance of peace</em>.” (Ps. 72:7). “Sometimes <strong>mountains</strong> represent human governments in the Bible, and Solomon may have intended this allusion. He had in mind a national government (<strong>mountains</strong>) that blessed the people and local government (<strong>the little hills</strong>) that ruled with <strong>righteousness</strong>. This godly government would accomplish at least three things · <strong>He will bring justice to the poor</strong>: Though they are often denied justice, the king and his government will make sure that justice is administered fairly. · <strong>He will save the children of the needy</strong>: The king and his government will rescue those most vulnerable in society. · <strong>And will break in pieces the oppressor</strong>: The king and his government will protect Israel, keeping the people free from external domination and from internal corruption.” (David Guzik on Ps. 72).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon was not able to offer lasting peace because he rebelled against God</u>.  Solomon’s reign lasted exactly 40 years (1 Kgs. 11:41-43). Because he misused God’s blessings to hoard wives and wealth and embrace idolatry, God placed all of Israel under His judgment. Simply put, Solomon failed to fear God: “The God of Israel said it; the Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘He who rules over mankind righteously, who rules in the fear of God,” (2 Sam. 23:3). God’s judgment included armed uprisings from the peoples under Solomon’s control. King Hadad of Edom plotted a revolt against the Jews’ rule in Jordan (1 Kgs. 11:14-18). He sought freedom for his people and revenge for the slaughter of the Edomites under David’s ruthless generals, like Joab (2 Sam. 8:13-14; 1 Chron. 18:12-13). Egypt’s Pharaoh was an initial ally of Solomon. But Pharaoh let Hadad hide in Egypt and gave him land and a wife to form an alliance once he led his revolt against Israel (1 Kgs. 11:17-22). Solomon ignored God’s warnings against forming an alliance with Egypt only to be betrayed by Egypt. Historians have confirmed that an Egyptian pharaoh Shishak (circa 945-924 B.C.) invaded Judah during Rehoboam’s reign (1 Kgs. 14:25-26). Shishak’s invasion confirms that the Bible is true, and God’s wrath against disobedient nations should not be ignored. Solomon also faced a revolt in Aram (Syria) (1 Kgs. 11:23-25). After God removed His hand of protection, Israel’s internal divisions also reemerged and formed the seeds for its future division into two kingdoms (1 Kgs. 11:26-40). Solomon’s kingdom would soon be reduced to a rump with only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (1 Kgs. 11:32; 2 Chr. 11:12). Lasting peace comes only from God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the Prince of Peace</u>. Jesus came to fulfill Solomon’s prayer for a peace that will never end: “And He will judge between the nations, and will mediate for many peoples; and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not lift up a sword against nation, and never again will they learn war.” (Is. 2:4). “For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; . . . Mighty God, Eternal Father, <em>Prince of Peace</em>.” (Is. 9:6). He is also the King of Peace (Heb. 7:1-3). “ . . . <em>the LORD will bless His people with peace</em>.” (Ps. 29:11). He again deserves your praise for offering to share His peace with you. “For as the earth produces its sprouts, and as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and <em>praise to spring up before all the nations</em>.” (Is. 61:11). He again deserves your praise for offering you His everlasting peace.</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-jesus-because-he-is-sovereign-over-evil.-ps.-728-11."><strong>4. <u>Sovereignty: Praise Jesus Because He is Sovereign Over Evil</u>. Ps. 72:8-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for the Messiah’s sovereign authority to be accepted and unchallenged</u>. Solomon again prayed for the arrival of the Messiah whose reign would encompass all the Earth: “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>May he also rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong> May the nomads of the desert bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust. <sup><strong>10 </strong></sup> May the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring gifts; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer tributes. <strong><sup>11</sup></strong> And may all kings bow down before him, all nations serve him</em>.” (Ps. 72:8-11). Every knee will one day bow to Jesus (Ro. 14:10; Phil. 2:10-11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom allowed Solomon to become respected by all who met him</u>.  Because Solomon wanted God’s wisdom to rule for God’s Kingdom, God blessed him with wisdom that also brought him the respect he needed to govern (1 Kgs. 3:28).  His wisdom would continue to set him apart until his lusts for women led him to idolatry.  Only Jesus, the King of Kings, would surpass Solomon’s God-given wisdom and righteousness.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is sovereign over the entire Earth</u>. .  Although Israel was a small nation surrounded by greater powers, David praised Yahweh as the ruler of the entire Earth:   “<em>The King of Glory Entering Zion.  A Psalm of David.  <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> The earth is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span>, and all it contains, the world, and those who live in it</em>.”  (Ps.  24:1).  Paul repeated David’s praise in the New Testament:  “The earth is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span>, and all it contains,”   (1 Cor. 10:26). Everything in heaven or on Earth belongs to God alone:  “Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.”  (Dt. 10:14).  “‘ . . . the thunder will cease and there will no longer be hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD’S.”’  (Ex. 9:29). “ . . . for all the earth is Mine;”  (Ex. 19:5 <sup>b</sup>).  “Whatever is under the entire heaven is Mine.”  (Job 41:11b).  “For the world is Mine, and everything it contains.”  (Ps. 50:12b).  There is no one with power comparable to His power: “Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,”  (Is. 46:9).  Thus, He is worthy of your praise and worship. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is sovereign over every nation and person on Earth</u>.  David also made clear that God’s authority extends over not just the Earth, but also “<em>those who live in it</em>.” (Ps.  24:1). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” (Ps. 10:16). Daniel later explained:  “It is He [God] who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.”  (Da. 2:21).  “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.”  (Job 12:23).  “Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.”  (Is. 40:15).  “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17).  “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; . . .”  (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’”  (Dan. 4:35).  Even when evil surrounds you or when you are ruled by evil leaders, do you trust that Jesus is still in ultimate control?     </p></li>
<li><p><u>When you walk with Jesus, you never need to fear Satan</u>.  Satan has temporary authority on the Earth because of original sin:  “in whose case <em>the god of this world</em> has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.”  (2 Cor. 4:4).  He tried to bargain with Jesus by offering all the kingdoms of Earth if only Jesus would bow before him (Matt. 4:8-9). Jesus rebuked Satan (Matt. 4:10).  He is no match for Jesus’ power:  “Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.”  (Jo. 12:31).  “ . . . because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.”  (1 Jo. 4:4b).  In the Book of Job, God set the limits for Satan’s attacks.  Jesus also controls any test that you may receive.  He will never give you a test that you cannot handle.  He also controls the timing and duration of any test.  You may not know your true limits, but Jesus does.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He uses His sovereign power for good</u>.  Jesus is in control and causes all things to work together for good (Ro. 8:28). Thus, He deserves praise for using His power for the greater good:  “whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, <em>who is over all</em>, <em>God blessed forever</em>. Amen.”  (Ro. 9:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you follow Jesus’ wisdom, He also promises to bless you with honor and respect</u>. Like Solomon, God will also bless you with honor and respect when you follow His wisdom.  “Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the country.”  (Dt. 28:3).  Joseph is another example regarding how following God-given wisdom can lead to honor and respect.  As a slave, Joseph was obedient to administer God’s wisdom for the benefit of others.  As a result, God blessed Joseph and the entire Egyptian household that he managed: “It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; thus the LORD’S blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field.” (Gen. 39:5).  Joseph showed that he was faithful and obedient in the face of the temptations of Potiphar’s wife.  He was again faithful and obedient to God, even when he was thrown in jail on false charges and then forgotten.  Because he showed that he was obedient and faithful in small things, God blessed him by elevating him to have power second only to Pharaoh  (Gen. 41:40-41).  God’s many blessings throughout the Bible show that He wants to bless you.  When you sin (not if you sin), He is faithful to forgive you when you repent of your sins  (1 Jo. 1:9).  The devil is your accuser and will try to make you feel unworthy of serving God after you sin  (Rev. 12:10).  Yet, when you repent, you are no longer subject to any condemnation  (Ro. 8:1).  Nevertheless, if you ignore God’s Ten Commandments that were meant for your protection, you make it more unlikely that He will bless you.  Like Solomon and Joseph, if you prove yourself obedient in small things, He will bless you with great things.  Are you showing yourself faithful and obedient with the small things so that God can grant you His wisdom?</p></li>

<h2 id="compassion-praise-jesus-for-his-love-and-compassion.-ps.-7212-14."><strong>5. <u>Compassion: Praise Jesus For His Love and Compassion</u>. Ps. 72:12-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for the Messiah who would rule with love and compassion</u>. Solomon praised the coming Messiah because He would rule with love and compassion: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>For he will save the needy when he cries for help, the afflicted also, and him who has no helper. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He will have compassion on the poor and needy, and he will save the lives of the needy. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>He will rescue their life from oppression and violence, and their blood will be precious in his sight</em>;” (Ps. 72:12-14). Jesus also loves you, and He has compassion for you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>True love and compassion come from Jesus</u>.  Jesus is the source of true love:  “Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.  The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.”  (1 Jo. 4:7-8). “We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.”  (1 Jo. 4:16). When you serve Him, you learn to love others:  “For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;”  (1 Jo. 3:11).  “This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.”  (Jo. 15:12). God the Father also showed His love for us through His willingness to give up His only son Jesus (Jo. 3:15).  If you truly love Jesus, you will want to show His love to others in need.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ promise to bless those who help those in need</u>.  David declared: “Blessed is one who considers the helpless; the LORD will save him on a day of trouble.” (Ps. 41:1). “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 82:3). As part of the Covenant that God gave to Moses, He promised to bless those who help the needy:  “You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your <em>God will bless you in all your work</em>, and in all your undertakings.”  (Dt. 15:10).  “You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your countrymen you shall not charge interest, so that the LORD your <em>God may bless you in all that you undertake</em> in the land which you are about to enter to possess.”  (Dt. 23:20). “The LORD will command the blessing for you in your barns and in everything that you put your hand to, and <em>He will bless you</em> in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.”  (Dt. 28:8).  “<em>One who is generous will be blessed</em>, because he gives some of his food to the poor.”  (Prov. 22:9).  If you show Jesus’ love to others, He will bless you.</p></li>

<h2 id="provision-praise-jesus-because-he-provides-for-you.-ps.-7215-17."><strong>6. <u>Provision: Praise Jesus Because He Provides for You</u>. Ps. 72:15-17.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon prayed for the Messiah who would forever provide for His people</u>. Solomon then praised the One, whose name “<em>name endure forever</em>”, for His abundant provision: “<strong><sup>15<em> </em></sup></strong><em>so may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him; and they are to pray for him continually; they are to bless him all day long. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>May there be abundance of grain on the earth on top of the mountains; its fruit will wave like the cedars of Lebanon; and may those from the city flourish like the vegetation of the earth. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>May his name endure forever; may his name produce descendants as long as the sun shines; and may people wish blessings on themselves by him; may all nations call him blessed</em>.” (Ps. 72:15-17). Solomon’s words could only apply to the Messiah, who will reign forever.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers abundant provision to His people</u>. If the Jews followed God’s Covenant, He promised them abundant life (Lev. 26:4; Joel 2:24; Prov. 3:10; Ps. 144:13).  God also promises to “pour out” His blessings when you tithe with the right motives (Mal. 8:3).  He does not hold back that which is good when you walk with Him (Ps. 84:11; 19:7).  Jesus also promised not just life but “abundant life” when you follow Him  (Jo. 10:10).  His blessing comes when you store up treasures in heaven by giving to others  (Lk. 12:33).  This blessing brings joy, happiness, and love no matter what trials you may face.  Are you being obedient and generous to receive this blessing?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His provision in your life</u>. Jesus’ provision in your life is a sign of His love for you and another reason for you to praise Him: “yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” (Acts 14:17). Failing to give thanks only causes Him grief (Jer. 5:24). Do you praise Jesus for His “abundant” provision? Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from Him (Jam. 1:17).</p></li>

<h2 id="glory-praise-jesus-for-sharing-his-glory-with-you.-ps.-7218-20."><strong>7. <u>Glory: Praise Jesus For Sharing His Glory With You</u>. Ps. 72:18-20.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon praised God for His glorious name</u>. Solomon concluded by praising God’s “<em>glorious name</em>”, who does wonders for His people: “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, the God of Israel, who alone works wonders. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>And blessed be His glorious name forever; and may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen and Amen. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended</em>.” (Ps. 72:18-20). Each of the five books within the Psalms ends with a similar benediction and blessing for Yahweh.  These include: Book One (Ps. 41), Book Three (Ps. 89), Book Four (Ps. 106) and Book Five  (Ps. 150). This book differs only because it contains a postscript to note the end of David’s prayers.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the King of Glory</u>.  God promised that the Messiah would come from David’s line (1 Chr. 17:11-12; 22:10; 2 Sam. 7:13; Jer. 33:17).  ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.’ Selah.”  (Ps. 89:4). “He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”  (Ps. 18:50).  Jesus was born into the line of David (Matt. 1:1).  He came to fulfill God’s covenant with David as the eternal King of Kings:  “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”  (Lk. 1:32-33).  “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.’”  (Rev. 19:16). Jesus, the King of Glory, rules in righteousness in heaven: “So I will establish his descendants forever and <em>his throne as the days of heaven</em>.” (Ps. 89:29).  </p></li>

<li><p><u>Jesus revealed His glory on Earth, but many failed to understand it</u>.  God the Father revealed His glory through Jesus Christ: “And the Word became flesh  . . .  and <em>we saw His glory</em>, glory as the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”  (Jo. 1:14). But only those with faith could see that Jesus was light of the world (Jo. 8:12). Most could not comprehend His light because they loved evil (Jo. 3:19).  “in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that <em>they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ</em>, who is the image of God.”  (2 Cor. 4:4).  Thus, they crucified Him:  “the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified <em>the Lord of glory</em>;”  (1 Cor. 2:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for offering to share His full glory with you</u>.  After Jesus returns, His Shekinah glory will again be present in the Temple (Micah 4:1-8; Zech. 14:3-9).  In heaven, you will also see His Shekinah glory without the need for a veil  (1 Jo. 3:2).  You “<em>will see His face. . . [and] the Light of God (“Shekinah glory”) will illumine them forever and ever</em>.”  (Rev. 22:5).  “And <em>He is the radiance of His glory</em> and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.  When He had made purification of sins, <em>He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</em>,” (Heb. 1:3).  “LORD, I love the dwelling of Your house, and the place <em>where Your glory remains</em>.”  (Ps. 26:8).  “Be exalted above the heavens, God; may <em>Your glory be above all the earth</em>.”  (Ps. 57:11). He deserves your praise for offering to share His glory with you.</p></li>
