<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 114 continues the psalmist’s praises for the Jews’ deliverance from Egypt. This psalm was sung during Passover.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> “It’s possible that Psalm 114 was written in Exile or just after.  Its intent was to remind Israel of the history that had made them who they were and to invite them to not only praise God for the wonders he had done, but also tremble in his renewed Presence.” (Stan Mast on Ps. 114).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Through the faith in the blood of the Passover lamb, death passed over the Jews. God then delivered them from first Egyptian bondage then 40 years of trials in the wilderness. These events all pointed to Jesus. He is the lamb of God (Jo. 1:29). He allowed death to pass over you and free you from bondage. Charles Spurgeon celebrated Psalm 114 because it is filled with deep, symbolic meaning that points to Jesus: “True poetry has here reached its climax: no human mind has ever been able to equal, much less to excel, the grandeur of this Psalm.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Here, the Bible reveals several things about Jesus that deserve your praise. Through faith in His atoning blood, He offers you: (1) deliverance, (2) fellowship, (3) a covenant relationship, (4) sovereignty, (5) transformation, (6) His holy majesty, and (7) eternal life.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, to encourage the Jews living through Babylonian captivity, the psalmist reminded them of God’s faithfulness in delivering them from Egyptian bondage. Jesus is also faithful to deliver you from bondage and death. Thus, He deserves your praise. <u>Second</u>, to further encourage God’s people, the psalmist reminded the Jews that God made a sanctuary amongst them in order to dwell with them. Jesus took on human form to dwell with us, and He made it possible for the Holy Spirit to dwell with you. Jesus deserves your praise for offering His fellowship to you. <u>Third</u>, through His covenant with Abraham, God established His dominion over Israel as its King. Through faith in Jesus, you become an heir to this covenant. Jesus also deserves your praise for offering you His covenant relationship. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist reminded the Jews of God’s power to rebuke the Red Sea and the River Jordan. No force of nature, human power, or demonic power can resist Him. Jesus is the sovereign ruler over creation. No force can harm you unless He allows it for some greater purpose. Again, He deserves your praise. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist used poetic language to refer to mountains skipping like rams. Jesus has the power to transform hearts as hard as rocks with His joy. Again, He deserves your praise. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist proclaimed that the whole Earth trembles before God. His enemies will one day tremble before Him. You can praise Jesus for His holy, just, and majestic character. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist celebrated when God caused water to gush from rocks during the Jews’ time in the wilderness. Jesus is your Rock, and the water symbolized the eternal life that He offers. The gushing water symbolizes the abundant life that He offers. He again deserves your praise.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God delivered His people once before and would do so again</u>. While suffering through 70 years of Babylonian captivity, the psalmist reminded the Jews that God was faithful to deliver them from Egyptian bondage: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>When Israel went forth from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a foreign language</em>,” (Ps. 114:1). “When Israel went out of Egypt; literally, at the going forth of Israel from Egypt; ἐν ἐξόδῳ Ἰσράηλ, LXX. The ‘going forth from Egypt’ was the only thing parallel in Israelitish history to the going forth from Babylon. The nation should learn what to expect in the future by what occurred in the past. The house of Jacob (compare the more common ‘house of Israel,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-3.htm">Psalm 98:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-19.htm">Psalm 135:19</a>) from a people of strange language; literally, from a stammering people; but a people of foreign speech is no doubt meant (compare the Septuagint, ἐκ λαοῦ βαρβάρου).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 114:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God proved His faithfulness by delivering His people from Egyptian bondage</u>. The psalmist’s goal was to encourage the Jews by reminding them of God’s prior miraculous acts of deliverance. He first told Moses what He would do to deliver His people from Egyptian bondage, “Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the labors of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.” (Ex. 6:6). After delivering His people, Moses then directed God’s people to never forget His supernatural acts of deliverance: “And Moses said to the people, ‘Remember this day in which you departed from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place. And nothing with yeast shall be eaten.’ . . . And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.”’ (Ex. 13:3, 14). To emphasize the universal nature of God’s offer of deliverance, this message is repeated in the New Testament: “The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.” (Acts 13:17). Jesus died on the cross to offer all who believe in Him deliverance from both bondage and death (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God warned the Jews that they would be placed back into bondage if they rejected Him</u>. The reference to a “<em>foreign language</em>” (Ps. 114:1) referred to the Jews’ 400 years of Egyptian captivity and subjugation: “He established it as a testimony in Joseph when he went throughout the land of Egypt. I heard a language I did not know:” (Ps. 81:5). To show the Jews that their Babylonian captivity was part of God’s plan for redemption, Moses used those same words to prophetically warn of the Jews future second time of bondage (Dt. 28:49). But the Jews ignored this warning. Jeremiah then repeated this warning: ‘“Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from far away, you house of Israel,’ declares the LORD. ‘It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, <em>a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say</em>.”’ (Jer. 5:15). But the Jews again ignored God’s warning, and they suffered because of their rebellion. Many Jews would have likely felt that God had given up on them after they ignored His repeated warnings. But God loves His people, and He is filled with mercy and grace. Even though you may have repeatedly sinned, Jesus is ready to forgive you (1 Jo. 1:9). Thus, He deserves your praise and worship for delivering you from bondage and death.</p></li>

<h2 id="fellowship-praise-jesus-for-offering-his-fellowship-to-you.-ps.-1142a."><strong>2. <u>Fellowship: Praise Jesus For Offering His Fellowship to You</u>. Ps. 114:2a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>After freeing His people, God dwelt with them</u>. After God dwelt with Israel’s 12 tribes in a tabernacle, He choose Jerusalem within the territory of Judah for His permanent dwelling place: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Judah became His sanctuary; . .</em> .” (Ps. 114:2a). “Judah was his sanctuary - His home; his abode; his sacred dwelling-place. Judah was the principal or leading tribe, recognized as the tribe where power was to be concentrated, and from which the Messiah was to proceed <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-12</a>; and hence, the name was early used to denote the entire people, and ultimately, as modified in the word Jews, became the common name of the nation.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 114:2).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-114/media/image4.jpg" style="width:6.01736in;height:2.03819in" alt="SHEKINAH GLORY" /></p>
<p>God’s glory filled the Temple to allow Him to fellowship with His people<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God took His people out of bondage to have a relationship with them</u>. While in the wilderness, God dwelled with His people to fellowship with them: “Have them construct a sanctuary for Me, <em>so that I may dwell among them</em>.” (Ex. 25:8). “And <em>I will dwell among the sons of Israel</em> and will be their God.” (Ex. 29:45). God again dwelt with His people after Solomon built the Temple (2 Chr. 7:1). But the glory of the Lord later departed from the Temple because of the Jews’ sins (1 Sam. 4:21-22; Ezek. 10:18). For the Jews who wondered if they could ever again enjoy God’s fellowship, Ezekiel promised that they would: “<em>My dwelling place also will be among them</em>; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.” (Ezek. 37:27). Because God loves His people, He sought to have a relationship with them. He seeks the same from you as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus came and dwelt with His people</u>. To fulfill Ezekiel’s promise and as part of His plan for redemption, Jesus was born in human form: “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (Jo. 1:14). Although He was sacrificed and ascended back into heaven, the Bible promises that we will one day again dwell with Jesus: “And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, ‘Behold, the tabernacle of God is among the people, and <em>He will dwell among them</em>, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,”’ (Rev. 21:3). Jesus’ plan has always been to have a relationship with mankind. He knocks at the door of your heart seeking to have a relationship with you (Rev. 3:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Until Jesus returns, the Holy Spirit dwells within us</u>. While we wait to dwell with Jesus in heaven, He has left us with the Holy Spirit. The Spirit dwells within us and provides the means for you to fellowship with Jesus: “Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.” (1 Cor. 3:16-17). “Or what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, ‘I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”’ (2 Cor. 6:16). He also protects you from evil: “You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4). You can show your appreciation by making your life a living sacrifice of gratitude (Ro. 12:1-2).</p></li>

<h2 id="covenant-praise-jesus-for-offering-a-covenant-relationship.-ps.-1142b."><strong>3. <u>Covenant: Praise Jesus For Offering a Covenant Relationship</u>. Ps. 114:2b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God selected Israel to be His covenant people</u>. Through Abraham, God formed a special covenant with all of Israel to rule over it: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong> <em>. . . Israel, His dominion</em>.” (Ps. 114:2b). God expected His people to respond by submitting to Him: “[T]he people of Israel were in a very particular and remarkable manner His dominion; from the time of their coming out of Egypt to their having a king, their government was properly a theocracy; God was their King, and by Him they were immediately ruled and governed, and had a body of laws given them from Him, and were under his immediate care and protection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>. In this they were typical of the saints called by grace, who are then translated from the power of Satan into the kingdom of Christ; whom they acknowledge to be their Lord and King, and whose laws, commands, and ordinances, they willingly observe; the people of God are often represented as a kingdom, and Christ as King of saints; the Targum is ‘the congregation of the house of Judah was united to his holiness, and Israel to his power.’” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 114:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God formed a covenant relationship with Abraham’s descendants</u>. God promised to form a covenant with Abraham’s descendants: “I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you.” (Gen. 17:7). When God freed the Jews from Egypt, He fulfilled His promise. He also established Himself as the one true ruler over Israel: “Then I will take you as My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, . . .” (Ex. 6:7). “ . . . then you shall be <em>My own possession among all the peoples</em>, for all the earth is Mine;” (Ex. 19:5b). Although the covenant is based upon faith, God still expects His subjects to obey Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith in Jesus, you become an heir to God’s covenant promises</u>. Abraham’s faith allowed all to share in God’s covenant: “And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:8)). When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He has dominion over you, and you become an heir to the covenant: “Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, ‘And to seeds,’ as one would in referring to many, but rather as in referring to one, ‘And to your seed,’ that is, Christ. . . And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise.” (Gal. 3:16, 29). But you cannot claim to love Jesus as your Lord if you openly rebel against Him (Jo. 14:21). The psalmist wanted the Jews to submit to their King. This lesson applies equally today.</p></li>
<li><p><u>As heirs to the covenant, God’s people were meant to be a kingdom of priests</u>. God set Israel apart as its King so that it could become a kingdom of priests: “ . . .<em>you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation</em>.’” (Ex. 19:6a). When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you also become part of His royal priesthood: “But you are a chosen people, <em>a royal priesthood</em>, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Pet. 2:9). This means that you have been given a special role as part of your covenant relationship to serve Him by helping others around you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>As part of His royal priesthood, Jesus wants you to be His light to the lost</u>. God formed His covenant with Israel, made it His dominion, and meant for the nation to be holy so that it would be a light to all other nations: “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; <em>I will also make You a light of the nations</em> so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”’ (Is. 49:6). As part of His royal priesthood, Jesus also wants you to be a light to the lost: ‘<em>Your light must shine before people</em> in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”’ (Matt. 5:16). Do your actions towards others properly reflect Jesus’ light within you of love and forgiveness?</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-jesus-as-the-sovereign-ruler-over-creation.-ps.-1143-5."><strong>4. <u>Sovereignty: Praise Jesus as the Sovereign Ruler Over Creation</u>. Ps. 114:3-5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>During the exodus, God demonstrated His full dominion and power over evil</u>. To stress God’s complete sovereignty, the psalmist pointed to God’s control over the Red Sea at the beginning of the exodus and over the Jordan River at the end: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The mountains skipped like rams, the hills, like lambs. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What ails you, sea, that you flee? Jordan, that you turn back?</em>” (Ps. 114:3-5). In the Bible, the sea often symbolized evil: “But the wicked are like the tossing sea, for it cannot be quiet, and its waters toss up refuse and mud.  ‘There is no peace,’ says my God, ‘for the wicked.’”  (Is. 57:20-21).  Thus, Job praised God’s power to trample the sea’s waves (Job 9:12).  Jesus trampled over the waves as part of His plan for salvation: “Did the LORD rage against the rivers, or was Your anger against the rivers, or was Your rage against the sea, that You rode on Your horses, <em>on Your chariots of salvation</em>?” (Hab. 3:8). When the sea disappears in heaven, it symbolizes the disappearance of evil (Rev. 21:1). These two miracles together symbolized God’s complete sovereignty over all evil: “When Christ comes for the salvation of his people, He redeems them from the power of sin and Satan, separates them from an ungodly world, forms them to be his people, and becomes their King. There is no sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God’s time is come, it shall be divided and driven back.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 114:3-5).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign over all creation</u>. At the beginning of the exodus, God showed His power over all creation by causing the Red Sea to part to allow the Jews to cross over (Ex. 14:21). “He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot; let’s rejoice there, in Him!” (Ps. 66:6). At the end of the exodus, God again showed His power over all creation by causing the Jordan River to dry up to allow the Jews to cross over (Josh. 3:16). “You broke open springs and torrents; You dried up ever-flowing streams.” (Ps. 74:15). The pagan nations all feared God’s mighty power (Josh. 2:10).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>God showed His sovereign power when He parted the Red Sea to redeem His people<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ passage across the Red Sea and the Jordan River symbolized their baptism</u>. With each generation, God baptized the Jews before they could enter the Promised Land: “For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; and <em>all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea</em>;” (1 Cor.10:1-2). Like the Jews, you also have been baptized into Jesus’ living waters: “Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?” (Ro. 6:3). “For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.” (Gal. 3:27). Just as you were baptized into the living waters of Christ, you are encouraged to teach others to do so as well: “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,” (Matt. 28:19). Are you leading others to Jesus Christ?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The passage through the Red Sea and the Jordan River symbolized the Jews’ redemption</u>. God also makes clear that the passage through the waters to the Promised Land symbolized the Jews’ redemption:  “Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; <em>who made the depths of the sea a pathway for the redeemed to cross over</em>?” (Is. 51:10). The symbolism of redemption is repeated in Moses’ subsequent song of praise: “In Your lovingkindness <em>You have led the people whom You have redeemed</em>; in Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.” (Ex. 15:13). In addition to being a symbol for “the wicked people” (Is. 57:20-21), the sea also symbolized both a “door” (Job 38:8-11) and a “boundary” (Prov. 8:29 NASB and NIV translations). The Jews understood that the Messiah would bring the people across the sea of distress: “And they will pass through the sea of distress and He will strike the waves in the sea, so that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; and the pride of Assyria will be brought down and the scepter of Egypt will depart.” (Zech. 10:11; Is. 11:15). Thus, Jesus’ control over the sea confirmed that He is God: “They became very much afraid and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?’” (Mark 4:41). When the sea disappears in heaven (Rev. 21:1), it also symbolizes the opening of the path that Jesus made possible for believers to pass into the Promised Land of everlasting life.</p></li>

<h2 id="transformation-praise-jesus-for-his-power-to-transform-hearts-as-hard-as-rocks-through-the-holy-spirit.-ps.-1146."><strong>5. <u>Transformation: Praise Jesus For His Power to Transform Hearts as Hard as</u> <u>Rocks Through the Holy Spirit</u>. Ps. 114:6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God can transform a hardened heart and fill it with joy</u>. In poetic form, the psalmist confirmed that the mountains would “skip” in God’s presence: “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Mountains, that you skip like rams? Hills, like lambs?</em>” (Ps. 114:6, 4). “He makes <em>Lebanon skip like a calf</em>, and Sirion like a young wild ox.” (Ps. 29:6). God can supernaturally fill with joy that which was once lifeless and hard: “<strong>Skipped.</strong>--The Hebrew word thus rendered is translated ‘dance’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm"><u>Ecclesiastes 3:4</u></a>. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm"><u>Psalm 18:7</u></a>.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm"><u>Exodus 19:18</u></a> was no doubt in the poet’s thought, but the leaping of the hills formed part of every theophany.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary on Ps. 114:4,6).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> He can also do this with any human heart.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for transforming your heart</u>. Through the prophet Ezekiel, God promised to transform the hearts of His people and give them a new spirit: “And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them. And I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,” (Ezek. 11:19). “Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.” (Ezek. 36:26). The new heart that God promised would allow His people to know Him: “I will also give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me wholeheartedly.” (Jer. 24:7). Jesus made this possible when He died to atone for our sins. This also allowed the Holy Spirit to live inside our hearts: “revealing yourselves, that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Cor. 3:3). If Jesus has transformed you, are you praying for Him to soften the hearts of others?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Holy Spirit offers joy when you live as a new creation</u>. Through faith in Jesus, you become a “new creation.” “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a <em>new creation</em>; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Cor. 5:17). If you live as a new creation by allowing the Spirit to guide you, you can experience His peace: “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but <em>the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace</em>,” (Ro. 8:6). “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.” (Gal. 5:22-23). The power of the Spirit “<em>makes a human heart cheerful.</em>” (Ps. 104:15).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>All creation will bow before Jesus in either fear or awe</u>. Jesus is supernaturally creating a new creation. For those who reject Jesus, they will tremble in fear and bow before Him: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Tremble, earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob</em>,” (Ps. 114:7). “Yahweh has come. In response, Ps. 114:7 commands the earth to writhe. This “writhing” (<strong> </strong><span dir="rtl">חִיל</span> ) is often associated with childbirth, so the psalmist could well be calling for the birth pangs through which the new will be brought forth.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 114:7).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> “So the earth should tremble because there was the sovereign Lord God of creation using all of nature in bringing about a new order.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 114:7).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Jesus’ believers do not need to tremble in fear of judgment.

<p>Jesus’ enemies will tremble in fear as He creates a new creation<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>You never need to fear evil when you do God’s will</u>. Although evil can at times feel overwhelming, no evil can stand before God. Any evil person or demonic spirit will tremble in fear before God: “Then the earth shook and quaked; and the foundations of the mountains were trembling and were shaken, because He was angry.” (Ps. 18:7). “God blesses us, so that all the ends of the earth may fear Him.” (Ps. 67:7). “His lightning lit up the world; the earth saw it and trembled.” (Ps. 97:4). “So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth, Your glory.” (Ps. 102:15). “He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke.” (Ps. 104:32). “Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the entire mountain quaked violently.” (Ex. 19:18). The disasters that we now observe are the “birth pains” of His new creation, “But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pains.” (Matt. 24:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Treat Jesus with the reverence that He is owed</u>. Because of who Jesus is and what He has done for us, believers will one day bow in awe of Him: “Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.” (Ps. 33:8). This means that you should treat the King of Kings with the reverence and respect that He deserves: “Worship the LORD in holy attire; tremble before Him, all the earth.” (Ps. 96:9). “Let the believer feel that God is near, and he will serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Awe is not cast out by faith, but the rather it becomes deeper and more profound. The Lord is most reverenced where he is most loved.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 114:7).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Does your walk with Jesus reflect the reverence He deserves?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His living waters</u>. Many Jews likely felt that God would not provide for their sinful nation. Thus, the psalmist concluded by reminding them that their God was filled with mercy and grace. Even when their ancestors spent 40 years in the desert for constant rebellions, God was faithful to supernaturally sustain them: “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of water</em>.” (Ps. 114:8). “The psalmist remembered one more event which demonstrated God’s power over creation during the Exodus years – when God brought forth water for His people from <strong>the rock</strong> and the hardened <strong>flint</strong>. This assured the people of God that His mighty presence works <em>for</em> them, not against them. As <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+113&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 113</a> closed with God’s compassion on the barren woman, this psalm closes with God’s compassion on thirsty Israel. His great power and might are not merely for the dividing of waters and the shaking of mountains. His majestic might brings blessing to His people one by one.” (David Guzik on Ps. 114:8).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God miraculously provided life-giving water from rocks in the desert</u>. Near the beginning of the exodus, God demonstrated His ability to give life by allowing Moses to draw water from a rock at Mount Horeb: “Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.” (Ex. 17:6). “The mountains flowed with water at the presence of the LORD, this Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.” (Jdgs. 5:5). Near the end of the exodus, God confirmed His ability to give life by again allowing Moses to draw water from a rock: “Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their livestock drank.” (Nu. 20:11). “He who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions, and its thirsty ground where there was no water; He who brought water for you out of the rock of flint.” (Dt. 8:15). “He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them plenty to drink like the ocean depths.” (Ps. 78:15). God will always provide for His people.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Jesus supernaturally provided for the Jews</u>. Jesus was the Rock who provided for the Jews with living waters: “and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.” (1 Cor. 10:4). He offers His waters of life to all who turn to Him as their Lord and Savior.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers the waters of eternal life</u>. The water that Jesus offered in the desert sustained them temporarily. But the waters that He offers believers will allow them to live forever: “but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.” (Jo. 4:14). Like the water that supernaturally gushed from the rock, He offers abundant eternal life: ‘Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, ‘If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’’” (Jo. 7:37-38).  “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.” (Jo. 10:10). In addition to providing eternal life, His water sanctifies you. Thus, “[l]et us draw near… having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.”  (Heb. 10:22). Thus, Jesus deserves your praise, and others deserve to know where to find His living water. </p></li>
