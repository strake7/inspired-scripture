<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 122 has many fascinating aspects to it. It is the third Song of Ascent, a prayer for the peace of Jerusalem, the 600<sup>th</sup> chapter in the Bible, and an end times prophecy. Its authorship is also filled with mystery. In modern translations, David is listed as the author. But the events described in the psalm take place long after his death in approximately 970 B.C. For example, it references contemporaneous events at “<em>the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>” or Temple (Ps. 122:1, 9). But the Temple was not built until after David’s death (1 Kgs. 1:9; 2 Chr. 7:11). Psalm 122 further describes in the third person “<em>the thrones of the house of David</em>.” (Ps. 122:5). The two preceding Songs of Ascent also describe a pilgrim’s return journey to worship in Jerusalem from a far-off pagan land (Ps. 120:5), which would not have applied to David. Thus, scholars like Alexander Kirkpatrick (1849-1940), the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Hebrew_(Cambridge)">Regius Professor of Hebrew</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University">Cambridge University</a> have argued that “the Psalm cannot have been written by David, for the Temple is standing, and the opening words are clearly those of one who has to travel to it from a distance; nor even in the time of the monarchy, for <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/122-4.htm">Psalm 122:4-5</a> appear to look back across the Exile to a distant past. Most probably it belongs to the time of Nehemiah, when the walls had been rebuilt, and means taken to provide the city with an adequate population.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In support of this view, the Greek Septuagint does not have the words “of David.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> But the Dead Sea Scrolls contain these words.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Thus, the words “of David” could have been a late addition to this psalm. Alternatively, David could have written this psalm as a prophecy the same way Moses wrote of Israel’s future exile centuries before it happened (Dt. 28:64-65). Whoever wrote Psalm 122, the prophetic prayers for peace in Jerusalem have been needed throughout history. Until Jesus returns, Jerusalem will be a stumbling block (Zech. 12:2). But Jesus will one day return to restore peace in Jerusalem and throughout the world. Psalm 122 reveals seven lessons regarding Jesus’ future reign over all the nations. When Jesus returns, His will offer all: (1) fellowship, (2) security, (3) unity, (4) joyful gratitude, (5) righteousness, (6) peace, and (7) goodness for His Church.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, after a long journey, the psalmist was glad to go to God’s Temple to worship and seek out His fellowship. Through worship and faith, Jesus also offers you His fellowship. <u>Second</u>, after a long and dangerous journey, the psalmist celebrated that his feet were safely behind the gates of Jerusalem. Through faith, Jesus also offers you security. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that Jerusalem was “firmly joined together,” possibly in celebration of Nehemiah’s rebuilding of its walls. Jesus also promises to unify His believers as one Church. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that the tribes could give thanks at one of the appointed holy festivals, which all foreshadowed Jesus. Jesus also offers believers many reasons to come together and express their joyful gratitude. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist gave thanks for the promised future restoration of the righteous reign of David’s line. Jesus will one day return to reign with justice and righteousness. <u>Sixth</u>, after ongoing conflict, the psalmist prayed for the peace of Jerusalem. Jesus’ reign will also bring His peace to all His people. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist declared that he would seek out God’s goodness. Out of grace, Jesus offers gifts that you are meant to use to serve His Church.</p>
<h2 id="fellowship-through-worship-jesus-offers-you-his-fellowship.-ps.-1221."><strong>1. <u>Fellowship: Through Worship, Jesus Offers You His Fellowship</u>. Ps. 122:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek out God’s presence at His places of worship</u>. After completing a journey from a far distant land while facing many enemies (Ps. 120-121), the psalmist celebrated that he could now worship in the Temple. “<em>A Song of Ascents, of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I was glad when they said to me, ‘Let’s go to the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.’” (Ps. 122:1). “The language is expressive of the happiness which is felt by those who love God and his sanctuary, when the stated season of worship returns. The heart is drawn to the house of prayer; the soul is filled with peace at the prospect of being again permitted to worship God. Who the speaker here is, is not known. It may have been David himself; more probably, however, it was designed by him to be used by those who should go up to worship, as expressive of their individual joy.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 122:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> David prepared for the building of the Temple (1 Chr. 22:2-16). Thus, he could have also prepared this psalm in advance for future pilgrims to use after Solomon finished building the Temple.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks anytime you can worship with others in God’s places of worship</u>. Other psalmists also celebrated any time they could be in God’s Temple to worship, including during the appointed festivals. “I remember these things and pour out my soul within me. For I used to go over with the multitude and walk them to the house of God, with a voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude celebrating a festival.” (Ps. 42:4). “Blessed is the person whose strength is in You, in whose heart are the roads to Zion!” (Ps. 84:5). Today, you don’t need to worship God at an appointed place. In any place where two or more are gathered in Jesus’ name for prayer or worship, He is present. “For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.” (Matt. 18:20).</p></li>

<p>Gladly seek out God’s fellowship by worshiping Him in His places of worship<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Don’t forsake the assembly of believers for worship, instruction, and encouragement</u>. The psalmist’s joy was not merely from reaching God’s Temple. His joy also came from worshiping with others. You should also make sure that your walk with God includes church worship, small group discipleship, and church service. “not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>During Jesus’ Millennial Reign, nations will gladly come to worship in the Temple</u>. Just as the psalmist professed joy at the opportunity to travel to Jerusalem to worship in God’s Temple, a day will come when the nations of the Earth will travel to Jerusalem to worship the Messiah in a new Temple. “Many nations will come and say, ‘Come and let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD and to the house of the God of Jacob, so that He may teach us about His ways, and that we may walk in His paths.’ For from Zion will go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.” (Micah 4:2). “And many peoples will come and say, ‘Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; so that He may teach us about His ways, and that we may walk in His paths.’ For the law will go out from Zion and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.” (Is. 2:3). These events correspond to Jesus’ Millennial Reign (Rev. 20:1-3).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-through-faith-jesus-offers-you-eternal-security.-ps.-1222."><strong>2. <u>Security: Through Faith, Jesus Offers You Eternal Security</u>. Ps. 122:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust in the security that Jesus offers</u>. After his journey, the psalmist celebrated that he was safe inside of Jerusalem. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem</em>,” (Ps. 122:2). “[H]appy are those that are within these gates, and have a comfortable assurance of their abiding there; and still more happy will they be who will be admitted within the gates of the New Jerusalem, which are said to be twelve, and every, one of them of one pearl; and through which none shall enter into the city but pure and holy persons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 122:2).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God offered the Jews security within Jerusalem</u>. David and other psalmists frequently sang of the joy they felt worshiping within the protective gates of Jerusalem. “So that I may tell of all Your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.” (Ps. 9:14). “The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwelling places of Jacob.” (Ps. 87:2). “In the courtyards of the LORD’S house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem! Praise the LORD!” (Ps. 116:19). “Stand at the gate of the LORD’S house and proclaim there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, who enter by these gates to worship the LORD!”’ (Jer. 7:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also has dwelling places waiting in the eternal Promised Land</u>. Jesus also promises that every member of the body of Christ will receive a secure dwelling place in heaven. No believers will be left behind: “In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.” (Jo. 14:2). Thus, even if you lose your possessions on Earth, your eternal inheritance cannot be taken.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers every believer with faith a chance to dwell securely in the new Jerusalem</u>. In Nehemiah’s time, Jews with the faith to live in the rebuilt Jerusalem received God’s blessing (Neh. 11:2). Today, any believer in Jesus receives the blessing of joyfully dwelling with Him forever in the new Jerusalem in heaven: “And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, ‘Behold, the tabernacle of God is among the people, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them, and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”’ (Rev. 21:2-4). This will also fulfill prophecies in the book of Isaiah: “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.” (Is. 35:10; 51:11). “But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing and her people for gladness. I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people; the voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.” (Is. 65:18-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also offers you eternal security from death and the evil one</u>. In the New Jerusalem, Jesus will ensure that you will never perish, and you will be out of the evil one’s reach. “and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.” (Jo. 10:28-30). Thus, you have many reasons to give thanks and find hope in times of darkness.</p></li>

<h2 id="unity-jesus-will-unify-his-believers-as-one-church.-ps.-1223."><strong>3. <u>Unity: Jesus Will Unify His Believers as One Church</u>. Ps. 122:3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through God’s faithful promises, find unity in the Body of Christ</u>. In addition to being well protected, the psalmist celebrated that Jerusalem had become unified, organized, and a well-built city of refuge. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Jerusalem, that has been built as a city that is firmly joined together</em>;” (Ps. 122:3). “This verse … is taken as a rustic’s impression on first seeing a compact city after being accustomed to straggling villages.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Ps. 122:3).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>David celebrated Jerusalem’s secure foundations</u>. In other psalms, David and other psalmists celebrated that Jerusalem was also well built and secure from its many enemies. “So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.” (2 Sam. 5:9). “Consider her ramparts; go through her palaces, so that you may tell of her to the next generation.” (Ps. 48:13). “By Your favor do good to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.” (Ps. 51:18). “For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, so that they may live there and possess it.” (Ps. 69:35). “The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the outcasts of Israel.” (Ps. 147:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nehemiah also rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem to make it safe and secure</u>. The psalmist’s wonder at seeing how Jerusalem was built suggested that he was seeing it for the first time. This could correspond with the time when God allowed Zerubbabel, Joshua, and Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls and its civilian infrastructure to allow the people to flourish. “So the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of armies, their God,” (Hagg. 1:14). “So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.” (Neh. 4:6).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Jews rejoiced after Nehemiah led them in rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Find unity in the body of Christ under the Holy Spirit</u>. The unity of the rebuilt City of Jerusalem also brought unity to God’s people. The Jews previously saw themselves as divided by their tribes, clans, and their different traditions. But God meant for His people to be united as one people. When the Jews arrived together with this psalmist to worship as pilgrims for an appointed feast, they did so as a united body of believers. Believers today also have different backgrounds and traditions. Many choose to define themselves by their differences. But, under the Holy Spirit’s guidance, God gives every believer the chance to live united as part of the body of Christ: “so we, who are many, <em>are one body in Christ</em>, and individually members one of another.” (Ro. 12:5). “Since there is one bread, we who are many are <em>one body</em>; for we all partake of the one bread.” (1 Cor. 10:17). “For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are <em>one body</em>, so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12). “There is <em>one body</em> and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;” (Eph. 4:4). “A Song of Ascents, of David. Behold, how good and <em>how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!</em>” (Ps. 133:1). “A church should be one in creed and one in heart, one in testimony and one in service, one in aspiration and one in sympathy. They greatly injure our Jerusalem who would build dividing walls within her; she needs compacting, not dividing … Note that Israel was one people, but yet it was in a sense divided by the mere surface distinction of tribes; and this may be a lesson to us that all Christendom is essentially one, though from various causes we are divided into tribes. Let us as much as possible sink the tribal individuality in the national unity, so that the church may be many waves, but one sea; many branches, but one tree; many members, but one body.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 122:3).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Do your actions help to unite or divide believers?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will unite all believers with him with His wedding to His Church</u>. In heaven, Jesus will marry His Church (Rev. 19:7-10). Believers will then become one with Him. Believers will experience perfect unity with Him and all His people. Again, you have many reasons to give thanks and find hope during times of darkness.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joyful-gratitude-jesus-offers-you-many-reasons-to-be-thankful.-ps.-1224."><strong>4. <u>Joyful Gratitude: Jesus Offers You Many Reasons to be Thankful</u>. Ps. 122:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Join together with other believers to celebrate Jesus</u>. The psalmist celebrated that he was united with other Jewish pilgrims to give joyful thanks during one of the three appointed holy festivals in Jerusalem. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>— An ordinance for Israel—to give thanks to the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Ps. 122:4). God blessed those who made these frequently difficult pilgrimages to Jerusalem to worship. “Blessed is the person whose strength is in You, in whose heart are the roads to Zion!” (Ps. 84:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God called His people to come together three times a year to collectively worship</u>. In the Torah, God called His people to travel to Jerusalem to worship during three appointed holy festivals. “Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me.” (Ex. 23:14; 23:17). These included: (1) (The “Passion Week”) Passover /<em>Pesach</em>/ the Feast of Unleavened Bread/ The Feast of First Fruits (Dt. 16:1-8; Nu. 28:16-25; Ex. 12:12-46)) (2) (The Feast of Weeks / Pentecost / <em>Shavuot</em> (Dt. 16:9-10; Nu. 28:26-31; Ex. 34:22), and (3) (The Feast of Tabernacles / Booths / “Ingathering” or <em>Sukkot</em> (Dt. 16:13-17; Ex. 23:16; 25:8; 34:22; 29:44-45; Lev. 23:33-43; Nu. 29:12-40; 31:10-13; Zech. 14:16-19; Jo. 7) “Three times a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God at the place which He chooses at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths; and they are not to appear before the LORD empty-handed.” (Dt. 16:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The festivals all foreshadowed Jesus</u>. Although the Jews did not understand it at the time, all of these festivals foreshadowed Jesus  (Col. 2:16-17; Heb. 10:1).  Each festival was a “holy convocation” or rehearsal for Jesus  (Lev. 23:2). The unknowingly rehearsed for His arrival. We are freed from any legal obligation to follow these festivals  (Col. 2:16-17). But they can help us to prepare for and celebrate His promised return.</p></li>
<li><p><u>All the nations will one day worship Jesus during His holy days</u>. Many believe that God’s holy days are relics of the Old Testament. But, through the prophet Isaiah, Jesus revealed that all the nations will come during His Millennial Reign and worship before Him during all His holy days: ‘“And it shall be from new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all mankind will come to bow down before Me,’ says the LORD.” (Is. 66:23). This will also continue in heaven. “Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before YOU, for Your righteous acts have been revealed.” (Rev. 15:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The importance of praise and gratitude in avoiding sin</u>.  Having gratitude for Jesus’ sacrifice for you on the cross is an important way to keep yourself free from sin.  If you don’t care about His sacrifice or if you don’t internalize the price He paid for you, you are more likely to sin.  One way to remain grateful is to constantly thank Jesus for His sacrifice:  “Through Him then, <em>let us continually offer up a</em> <em>sacrifice of praise</em> to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.”  (Heb. 13:15).  As an example to follow, David regularly thanked God through songs of praise (e.g., Ps. 18:49; 26:7; 30:4, 12; 50:14; 69:30; 75:1; 79:13; 92:1; 95:2; 97:12; 100:4; 106:1; 107:1, 8; 116:17; 118:1; 119:62; 140:13; 147:7).  Another way to be thankful is to offer your life as a living sacrifice of gratitude: “You are not your own; you were bought at a price.  Therefore, glorify God in your body.”  (1 Cor. 6:19-20). “You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men”  (1 Cor. 7:23).  “Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, <em>to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice</em>, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”  (Ro. 12:1-2).  Do you regularly sing songs of gratitude?  Is your life a living sacrifice of gratitude?</p></li>

<h2 id="righteousness-jesus-will-reign-with-justice-and-righteousness.-ps.-1225."><strong>5. <u>Righteousness: Jesus Will Reign With Justice and Righteousness</u>. Ps. 122:5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ righteousness and justice</u>. In hope for the promised restoration of the Davidic line of kings, the psalmist gave thanks for the promised rule of the Messiah from David’s line, who would rule with justice and righteousness. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>For thrones were set there for judgment, the thrones of the house of David</em>.” (Ps. 122:5). “[I]n the New Jerusalem there will be thrones set, not only for the twelve apostles of Christ, and for the martyrs of Jesus, but for all the saints; there will be the thrones of God and of the Lamb, and every overcomer shall sit down on the same; this honour will have all the saints, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 122:5).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God for His righteousness</u>. As an example for believers to follow, the psalms repeatedly praise God for His righteousness: “God is a <em>righteous</em> judge, and a God who shows indignation every day.” (Ps. 7:11). “For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging <em>righteously</em>.” (Ps. 9:4). “For the LORD is <em>righteous</em>, He loves <em>righteousness</em>; the upright will see His face.” (Ps. 11:7). “He loves <em>righteousness and justice</em>; the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.” (Ps. 33:5). “I have not hidden Your <em>righteousness</em> within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation.” (Ps. 40:10). “And the heavens declare His <em>righteousness</em>, for God Himself is judge. Selah” (Ps. 50:6). “The heavens declare His <em>righteousness</em>, and all the peoples have seen His glory.” (Ps. 97:6). “Or what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as <em>righteous</em> as this whole Law which I am setting before you today?” (Dt. 4:8). “Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will also help you, I will also uphold you with My <em>righteous right hand</em>.” (Is. 41:10). Because God is righteous, you can trust Him to keep His promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will come to restore the eternal throne of justice promised to David</u>. God promised David an eternal covenant. “He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:13). “So I will establish his descendants forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” (Ps. 89:29). Dave later told Solomon that his descendants would forever be on the throne to bring justice to God’s people if they obeyed Him. “so that the LORD may fulfill His promise which He spoke regarding me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful about their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and all their soul, you shall not be deprived of a man to occupy the throne of Israel.”’ (1 Kgs. 2:4). For a time, David’s descendants lost their right to rule because of their disobedience. But Jesus will return and restore the promise that God made to David. “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “Upon the Davidic throne of justice King Jesus will sit, and we want no one else there. He will decide matters of justice and punishment, mercy and pardon. The hope of justice will be realized when he reigns (122:5). God’s people will be unified in praise (122:3-4) as they enjoy shalom in Jerusalem (122:6-7), and all will want to worship God (122:1-2) for the sake of God’s glory and the good of our companions (122:8-9). (James Hamilton, Ps.122).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus is our righteous and just judge<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8). “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30). “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Spirit of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding</em> . . . <em>with righteousness He will judge</em> the poor, and decide with fairness for the humble of the earth; . . . <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.” (Is. 11:1-5). “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with <em>justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore</em>.”  (Is. 9:7; 16:5).  “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  He will judge evil and deliver His people. Thus, you can trust Him to be fair and just and right every wrong against you.</p></li>

At a time when Jerusalem remained surrounded by enemies seeking to destroy it, the psalmist prayed for God’s peace and prosperity for both Jerusalem and all of God’s people. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: ‘May they prosper who love you. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>May peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.’ <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For the sake of my brothers and my friends, I will now say, ‘May peace be within you</em>.’” (Ps. 122:6-8). “Those who can do nothing else for the peace of Jerusalem, may pray for it.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 122:6-8).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jerusalem has been and will continue to be a stumbling block</u>. Through Zechariah, God warned that Jerusalem would be a stumbling block for the nations: “Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. It will come about on that day that <em>I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples</em>; all who lift it will injure themselves severely. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.” (Zech. 12:2-3). “For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be taken, the houses plundered, the women raped, and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be eliminated from the city.” (Zech. 14:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Prince of Peace will restore peace throughout the world</u>. Jesus is the promised Prince of Peace: “For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called wonderful Counselor, mighty God, eternal Father, <em>Prince of Peace</em>.” (Is. 9:6). He will bring an end to all conflict. “And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young lion and the fattened steer will be together; and a little boy will lead them.” (Is. 11:6). ‘“The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil or harm on all My holy mountain,’ says the LORD.” (Is. 65:25). “But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.” (2 Pet. 3:13). Thus, believers have many reasons to be thankful and have hope.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a prayer warrior for peace</u>. Until Jesus returns, Jerusalem will continue to be a source of conflict. Believers are called upon to be intercessors to pray for peace to be restored in Jerusalem. “Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her; be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her,” (Is. 66:10). “A prayer of a righteous person, when it is brought about, can accomplish much.” (Jam. 5:16b).</p></li>

<li><p><u>When others attack you, find peace in Jesus</u>. The struggles that Jerusalem experienced correspond with the struggles that all believers experience in the world. When you encounter conflict, Jesus offers you His peace if you turn to Him in faith. “<em>Peace I leave you, My peace I give you</em>; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that <em>in Me you may have peace</em>. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). “For <em>He Himself is our peace</em>, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “The LORD lift up His face to you, and give you peace.” (Nu. 6:26). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be at peace with others</u>.  Jesus’ offer of peace also includes His command that you be at peace with others when it is possible.  “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.”  (Ro. 12:18).  “Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”  (Mark 9:50). If you stay at peace with others around you, Jesus promises to bless you:  “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”  (Matt. 5:9).  Are you a peacemaker when others try to create conflict with you?</p></li>

<h2 id="grace-jesus-pours-out-blessing-for-you-to-serve-his-church.-ps.-1229."><strong>7. <u>Grace: Jesus Pours Out Blessing For You to Serve His Church</u>. Ps. 122:9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek out Jesus’ grace and goodness to serve His Church</u>. As our example, the psalmist committed to seeking out all the grace and good things that God offers to serve. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>For the sake of the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, I will seek your good</em>.” (Ps. 122:9). “Whereas in verse 8 the psalmist resolved to pray for ‘peace’ within the city; now he is determined to seek ‘good’ for it. ‘Good’ (<span dir="rtl">ט֣וֹב</span>; s.v. Ps. 34:8) is a broad term; its meaning includes anything that promotes, preserves or enhances life. Here the psalmist is seeking the best for the city. And his efforts are for the sake of the ‘house of the Lord.’ If the city enjoys peace and prosperity, the worship of the LORD in the sanctuary will thrive.”<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God pours out His blessings on His servants to bless His people</u>. Throughout history, God has poured out blessings on His faithful servants so that they could bless God’s people. For example, He made Joseph the second most powerful person in Egypt to save God’s people. “And he had him ride in his second chariot; and they proclaimed ahead of him, ‘Bow the knee!’ And he placed him over all the land of Egypt.” (Gen. 41:43). Centuries later, He made Mordecai the second most powerful person in Persia to again save God’s people. “For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his entire nation.” (Esth. 10:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His many gifts in your life</u>.  Paul urged believers to thank Jesus for His many indescribable gifts:  “Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!” (2 Cor. 9:15).  Are you giving thanks for the many gifts in your life?  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Use God’s gifts to benefit His Church</u>. Psalm 122:9 also strongly implies that God has given each believer a gift for a special purpose in advancing the needs of His Church. “This has a special application for the Christian under the New Covenant. For us, the church is the <strong>house of the LORD</strong>, with Jesus the Head and Son of the house (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Hebrews+3.5-6&amp;t=NKJV">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Hebrews+10.21&amp;t=NKJV">Hebrews 10:21</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Peter+2.5&amp;t=NKJV">1 Peter 2:5</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Peter+4.17&amp;t=NKJV">1 Peter 4:17</a>). What makes the church special is that it is <em>God’s</em> habitation, <em>His</em> house. His presence makes it special. Ancient Jerusalem had political, economic, and social importance. Yet the most important reason to love and care for Jerusalem was because of <strong>the house of the LORD</strong>. Christians should have the same great care for and focus upon the work of God’s house. <strong>I will seek your good</strong>: Just as it was good for pilgrims in Israel to <strong>seek</strong> the good of Jerusalem <em>for the sake of God’s house</em>, so Christians today can and should <strong>seek</strong> the <strong>good</strong> of society for the sake of God’s house.” (David Guzik on Ps. 122:9) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
