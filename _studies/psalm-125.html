<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the sixth Song of Ascent (Ps. 120–134). “The so-called ‘Songs of Degrees,’ of which this psalm is one, are probably a pilgrim’s song-book, and possibly date from the period of the restoration of Israel from the Babylonish captivity. In any case, this little psalm looks very much like a record of the impression that was made on the pilgrim, as he first topped the crest of the hill from which he looked on Jerusalem.” (Alexander MacLaren’s Expositions of Holy Scripture, Ps. 125).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Here, the psalmist encountered government tyranny. Through his psalm, God reveals seven blessings that come from trusting Him during any trial. These include: (1) stability, (2) protection, (3) hope, (4) perseverance, (5) grace, (6) discipline, and (7) peace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in the face of some form of government oppression, the psalmist declared that those who trust in God will not be moved. If you place your trust in God, He also offers you stability during any trial. <u>Second</u>, for those who trust God, the psalmist further promised that God will surround them to protect them. If you place your trust in God, He also offers you His protection. <u>Third</u>, at a time of government opposition, the psalmist declared his faith that those who trust in God will one day be free from tyranny. For those who place their trust in God, He also offers this hope. This hope includes the promise of the future perfect reign of Jesus Christ. <u>Fourth</u>, for those made righteous through their faith and their trust in God, the psalmist further promised that they would not be compelled to sin. For those who trust God, He also helps them to persevere. He also strengthens them to turn away from the temptations of evil. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist pleaded for God to bless those who do good and are upright in their hearts. For those with the faith to fully trust God, He also offers to pour out His goodness and grace. <u>Sixth</u>, for those who reject God’s ways and fail to trust Him, the psalmist warned that God may lead them away with those who embrace evil. If you trust God, have faith that He will correct you and discipline you out of love when you turn to sin. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist prayed for God’s peace upon Jerusalem, a reference to all God’s peoples. If you trust God, He will also offer you His peace during a trial.</p>
<h2 id="stability-trust-god-and-he-will-offer-stability-during-a-trial.-ps.-1251."><strong>1. <u>Stability: Trust God, and He Will Offer Stability During a Trial</u>. Ps. 125:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>No evil can move a person with the faith to fully trust God</u>. For those who fully trust God, the psalmist promised that God will make them immovable in the face of the enemy’s attacks, like Mount Zion. “<em>A Song of Ascents. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Those who trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever</em>.” (Ps. 125:1). “We can’t properly put our trust in Him until we remove our trust in other things. He alone is our refuge and strength … The pilgrim who came from afar was impressed with the stature and standing of <strong>Mount Zion</strong>, the prominent hill upon which Jerusalem was established. The one who believes and trusts in the LORD is promised the same security, and he or she <strong>abides forever</strong>. Our place in His love, His new life, and His gracious purpose lasts forever and <strong>cannot be moved</strong>. · Some people are like the sand, ever shifting and unstable (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+7.26&amp;t=NKJV">Matthew 7:26</a>). · Some people are like the sea, restless and unsettled (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+57.20&amp;t=NKJV">Isaiah 57:20</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=James+1.6&amp;t=NKJV">James 1:6</a>). · Some people are like the wind, uncertain and inconsistent (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Ephesians+4.14&amp;t=NKJV">Ephesians 4:14</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 125:1) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith and trust, God also offers you stability</u>. Solomon promised that those made righteous through their faith will not be shaken in the face of a trial. “The righteous will never be shaken, but the wicked will not live in the land.” (Prov. 10:30). David made similar promises for Israel’s leaders. “For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the faithfulness of the Most High he will not be shaken.” (Ps. 21:7). “God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.” (Ps. 46:5).</p>

<p>When you face a trial, pray for Jesus to strengthen you<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith and trust in God, no evil can move you</u>. Jesus used the analogy of the mustard seed of faith to convey that you can move great things when you have faith. “And He said to them, ‘Because of your meager faith; for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.”’ (Matt. 17:20). The converse is likely true as well. With faith and trust, He will also give you supernatural power to find stability during a crisis or a trial. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God in the small things, and your faith will grow over time</u>. If you are consistent in trusting God, your faith will grow like the mustard seed to become stronger and powerful over your lifetime. “He presented another parable to them, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his field; and this is smaller than all the other seeds, but when it is fully grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”’ (Matt. 13:31-32). You can also grow your faith by reading and listening to God’s Word. “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” (Ro. 10:17).</p></li>

<h2 id="protection-trust-god-and-he-will-offer-you-his-protection.-ps.-1252."><strong>2. <u>Protection: Trust God, and He Will Offer You His Protection</u>. Ps. 125:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God also offers you His Hedge of protection when you place your full trust in Him</u>. As a continuation of the blessings God offers to those who fully trust and have faith Him (Ps. 125:1), the psalmist also promised that God would completely surround them with His presence and protection for all eternity. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> surrounds His people from this time and forever</em>.” (Ps. 125:2). “Jerusalem, except on the north, is encompassed with hills or mountains, so that although the city was built on hills - Zion, Moriah, Bezethah, Acra - it was itself surrounded by hills higher than any of these, and was, in a certain sense, in a valley … So the Lord is around about his people ... - As Jerusalem is thus protected by the hills around, so the people of God are protected by Yahweh. He surrounds the church; he is exalted far above the church; he guards the approaches to the church; he can defend it from all its foes. Under his protection it is safe. Jerusalem, as surrounded by hills and mountains, has thus become an emblem of the church at all times; its security was an emblem of the security of all who trust in the Lord.” (Albert Barnes Notes on the Bible, Ps. 125:2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith and trust, God’s presence will also surround you and protect you</u>. In a prior Song of Ascent, the psalmist promised God’s eternal protection for those who trust and have faith in Him. “The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in from this time and forever.” (Ps. 121:8). “You have encircled me behind and in front, and placed Your hand upon me.” (Ps. 139:5). ‘“But I,’ declares the LORD, ‘will be a wall of fire to her on all sides, and I will be the glory in her midst.”’ (Zech. 2:5). “Psalm 125:1 likens those who trust Yahweh to what will last, the to-the-age-abiding Mount Zion, and verse 2 explains why: because just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, Yahweh surrounds his people with his unconquerable protection.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 125:2).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God protected the Jews in Nehemiah’s time when their enemies tried to stop them</u>. In Nehemiah’s day, the local opponents of the Jews first mocked the Jews. They then defamed the Jews to try to stop their rebuilding plans. “But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked us and despised us, and said, ‘What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”’ (Neh. 2:19). “Now it came about that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry, and he mocked the Jews.” (Neh. 4:1). When your enemies mock you to try to stop you, turn to God for protection.</p>

<p>Turn to Jesus for protection when you are under attack<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, God can be your shield against Satan</u>. When you have faith in God and take refuge in Him, He will be your refuge against Satan’s attacks. “For you have made the LORD, my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place. <em>No evil will happen to you,</em> nor will any plague come near your tent.” (Ps. 91:9-10). “You will pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me, for You are my strength.” (Ps. 31:4). “But whoever listens to me will live securely and will be at ease from the dread of evil.” (Prov. 1:33). “No harm happens to the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble.” (Prov. 12:21). ‘“No weapon that is formed against you will succeed; and you will condemn every tongue that accuses you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their vindication is from Me,’ declares the LORD.” (Is. 54:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will always be with His people to protect them</u>. The psalmist promised God’s presence “<em>from this time and forever</em>.” (Ps. 125:2). God promised that He would never leave or forsake His people. “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or in dread of them, for the LORD your God is the One who is going with you. He will not desert you or abandon you.” (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5). Jesus came to fulfill the promise of God’s eternal presence and protection. “<strong><sup> </sup></strong>teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matt. 28:20). As a saved believer, Jesus will further ensure that you will never perish, and you will be out of the evil one’s reach. “and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.” (Jo. 10:28-30). Thus, you have many reasons to give thanks for Jesus’ mercy and grace.</p></li>

<h2 id="hope-trust-god-and-he-will-offer-you-hope-during-a-trial.-ps.-1253a."><strong>3. <u>Hope: Trust God, and He Will Offer You Hope During a Trial</u>. Ps. 125:3a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God offers you hope through Jesus’ promised, eternal reign</u>. In reference to some form of government oppression that the Jews encountered while rebuilding Jerusalem, the psalmist  prophesied that a day would come when the world’s evil rulers will no longer be able to oppress God’s faithful believers. “<strong><sup>3a </sup></strong><em>For the scepter of wickedness will not rest upon the land of the righteous,…”</em> (Ps. 125:3a). “The ‘scepter of wickedness’ does not refer simply to the fact that Israel was subject to Persian rule, but to the injuries done them by the Samaritans and others with the sanction of the Persian power, resulting in the disastrous condition of things which Nehemiah had found on his arrival. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-23.htm">Ezra 4:23</a>.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Ps. 125:3).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Enemies fought back after the Jews refused to allow other faiths in the Temple</u>.  When the Jews started the Temple rebuilding process, local Samaritans initially sought to ensure that the future Temple would include both pagan and Jewish worship. They alleged that they had been sacrificing to Yahweh since the “since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria (circa 681 to 669 B.C.), who brought us up here.”  (Ezra 4:1-3).  They were captured servants from other nations whom the Assyrians brought to Northern Israel after King Sargon II deported most of the ten northern tribes (2 Kgs. 17:34-41).   These foreign exiles intermarried with the Jews who remained in Northern Israel.  Together, they formed a hybrid religion that worshiped both Yahweh and idols.  If the returning Jews had accepted their help, these Samaritans would have demanded the right to include pagan worship in the Temple along with Yahweh worship.  In modern terms, they would be celebrated for advocating diversity of worship.  The Samaritans would have viewed the returning Jewish pilgrims as extremists who threatened their inclusive religious practices.  They used deception to advance their agenda.  The returning Jews said no to their help while still trying to live at peace.  The Samaritans then responded with conflict.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are oppressed, place your hope in Jesus</u>. There were many times when the psalmists had no answer to their conflicts. All they could do was place their hope in God. “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? <em>My hope is in You</em>.” (Ps. 39:7). “For <em>You are my hope;</em> Lord GOD, You are my confidence from my youth.” (Ps. 71:5). “For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and <em>a hope</em>.”’ (Jer. 29:11). When your adversary refuses to reconcile, Jesus wants you to place your hope in Him. He will then encourage you. “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to <em>a living hope</em> through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,” (1 Pet. 1:3). “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a <em>hope</em> both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). “For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and <em>the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope</em>.” (Ro. 15:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will come to restore the eternal throne of justice promised to David</u>. God promised David an eternal covenant. “He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:13). “So I will establish his descendants forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” (Ps. 89:29). Dave later told Solomon that his descendants would forever be on the throne to bring justice to God’s people if they obeyed Him. “so that the LORD may fulfill His promise which He spoke regarding me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful about their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and all their soul, you shall not be deprived of a man to occupy the throne of Israel.”’ (1 Kgs. 2:4). For a time, David’s descendants lost their right to rule because of their disobedience. But Jesus will return and restore the promise that God made to David. “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “Upon the Davidic throne of justice King Jesus will sit, and we want no one else there. He will decide matters of justice and punishment, mercy and pardon. The hope of justice will be realized when he reigns (122:5). God’s people will be unified in praise (122:3-4) as they enjoy shalom in Jerusalem (122:6-7), and all will want to worship God (122:1-2) for the sake of God’s glory and the good of our companions (122:8-9). (James Hamilton, Ps.122).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Jesus is our righteous and just judge<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8). “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30). “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “<sup>1</sup> Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <sup>2 </sup>The Spirit of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding</em> . . . <em>with righteousness He will judge</em> the poor, and decide with fairness for the humble of the earth; . . . <sup>5 </sup>Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.” (Is. 11:1-5). “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with <em>justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore</em>.”  (Is. 9:7; 16:5).  “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  He will judge evil and deliver His people. Thus, you can trust Him to be fair and just and right every wrong against you.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God can also strengthen and guide you away from temptation</u>. Possibly because some Jews had given into the influence of evil rulers, the psalmist further prophesied that a day would come when God’s faithful believers would also be freed from the temptations to give into evil in the world around them. “<strong><sup>3b</sup></strong> <em>… so that the righteous will not extend their hands to do wrong</em>.” (Ps. 125:3b). “The point is that the true believer would not begin to get involved in evil activities just because there is a wicked government making it difficult for them to hold to their integrity … The assurance of the psalmist is that the wicked government would not be able to pressure the faithful to comply with evil practices, or influence them to live on a lower standard of righteousness. This assurance does not mean that believers would not be persecuted or reproached for their faith; it means that they will not waver in their faithfulness.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 125:3).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God knows your limits and will protect you from temptations that exceed your abilities</u>. The message in this verse is that “God will not try men beyond that they are able.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 125:3).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> “… He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.” (1 Cor. 10:13). But you are called upon for Jesus to strengthen you and to lead you away from temptation. “‘And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”’ (Matt. 6:13). “But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.” (2 Thess. 3:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Persevere in your faith</u>.  When you encounter oppression, pray for God’s strength to persevere.  “Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.”  (Gal. 6:9).  “But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.”  (2 Thess. 3:13).  “You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.”  (Matt. 10:22).  Every believer will experience loss and setbacks because we live in a fallen world.  But you must never allow your setbacks to cause you to give up.  Instead, you must persevere in your faith.</p></li>

<h2 id="grace-trust-god-and-he-will-pour-out-his-goodness-and-grace.-ps.-1254."><strong>5. <u>Grace: Trust God, and He Will Pour Out His Goodness and Grace</u>. Ps. 125:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>With faith and trust, God will pour out His goodness and blessings</u>. In the face of oppression, the psalmist prayed for God to be gracious and bless His people. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Do good, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to those who are good and to those who are upright in their hearts</em>.” (Ps. 125:4). “Those who trust in the Lord are good; for faith is the root of righteousness, and the evidence of uprightness. Faith in God is a good and upright thing, and its influence makes the rest of the man good and upright. To such God will do good: the prayer of the text is but another form of promise, for that which the Lord prompts us to ask he virtually promises to give. Jehovah will take off evil from his people, and in the place thereof will enrich them with all manner of good. When the rod of the wicked is gone his own rod and staff shall comfort us. Meanwhile it is for us to pray that it may be well with all the upright who are now among men. God bless them, and do them good in every possible form. We wish well to those who do well. We are so plagued by the crooked that we would pour benedictions upon the upright.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 125:4).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="/psalm-125/media/image4.jpeg" style="width:5.99583in;height:3.4604in" alt="Psalm 125:4 Do good, O LORD, to those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts." /></p>
<p>God desires to pour out His grace and goodness upon you<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of grace, God’s blessings that are based upon faith and not conduct</u>.  There are two kinds of blessings in the Bible; those that are unearned and those that are earned. Salvation is an example of a blessing that cannot be earned.  You cannot earn your salvation by being obedient.  Instead, you are saved by your faith alone  (Ro. 7:6; 8:3).  If salvation could be earned by keeping the Law, Jesus would have died needlessly at the cross  (Gal. 2:21).  As another example, by your faith alone you are blessed to become part of Abraham’s family and an adopted child of God:  “<em>So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer</em>.”  (Gal. 3:9).  “For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through <em>the righteousness of faith</em>.”  (Ro. 4:13).  As a third example, when you accept Jesus by faith, God seals you with the Holy Spirit as an eternal pledge or a down-payment on your salvation  (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:14).  Even when you break the Law, God promises that His Spirit will never leave you nor forsake you  (Heb. 13:5; Dt. 31:6).  Jesus also promised various conditional blessings in the beatitudes.  For example, He promised “rewards” for those who store up their treasures in heaven  (Matt. 6:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who persevere for Him</u>.  As another example, if persevere through your trials, Jesus will bless you:  “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.”  (Jam. 1:12).  If your strength fails you, pray for Jesus’ strength.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you faithfully serve others for Jesus, He will also bless your labors for Him</u>.  When you serve others in faith, you are in effect serving Jesus:  “The King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.”’  (Matt. 25:40; 10:42; Mk. 9:41).  “One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” (Prov. 19:17).  You should never serve out of a motivation to be rewarded.  Yet, when you serve with the right motives, God will remember your works for Him:  “For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.”  (Heb. 6:10).  Are you stepping out in faith to serve the poor so that Jesus can bless you?  </p></li>

<h2 id="discipline-trust-god-to-correct-you-when-you-turn-to-sin.-ps.-1255a."><strong>6. <u>Discipline: Trust God to Correct You When You Turn to Sin</u>. Ps. 125:5a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you reject God and embrace sin, God may be forced to discipline you</u>. For the Jews who had given into the evil influences around them, the psalmist warned that they could be expelled from Israel. “<strong><sup>5a </sup></strong><em>But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will lead them away with those who practice injustice</em>.” (Ps. 125:5a). “But, as for those unstable persons who, either through fear of the rod, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-3.htm">Psalm 125:3</a>, or for other considerations, shall turn aside from those good ways, which, for a time, they professed to walk in, unto sinful courses, and who, instead of growing better by the Lord’s chastisements, decline more and more from the paths of righteousness; <em>the Lord shall lead them forth — </em>Namely, unto punishment, as malefactors are led to the place of execution; <em>with the workers of iniquity — </em>With the most obstinate and profligate sinners, with whom he will appoint them their portion; for, as they partook of their sins, they shall also partake of their plagues.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on the Bible, Ps. 125:5).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God was forced to discipline Israel by sending it into exile</u>. Nehemiah warned that many Jews in his time were still in spiritual captivity to evil. “Behold, we are slaves today, and as to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty, behold, we are slaves in it.”  (Neh. 9:36). Before the Jews even entered the Promised Land, Moses warned them that disobedience could force God to lead them into exile. “Because you did not serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God with joy and a glad heart, for the abundance of all things; <sup>48 </sup>therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things;…”  (Dt. 28:47(a)).  Centuries later, God sent prophets to repeat these warnings. “Then I will cause your enemies to bring it into a land you do not know; for a fire has been kindled in My anger, it will burn upon you.”  (Jer. 15:14).  “And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance that I gave you; and I will make you serve your enemies in the land which you do not know; for you have kindled a fire in My anger which will burn forever.”  (Jer. 17:4).  “But they will become his slaves so that they may learn the difference between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”  (2 Chr. 12:8). </p></li>
<li><p><u>God disciplines those He loves</u>.  Another psalmist promised a blessing for the person who accepts God’s discipline: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Blessed is the man whom You discipline, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and whom You teach from Your Law,” (Ps. 94:12). God disciplines sinners the same way a loving father disciplines a wayward child:  “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,”  (2 Sam. 7:14). In a similar way, God disciplines His people out of love:  “Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5).  “It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?” (Heb. 12:7).  “But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.”  (1 Cor. 11:32).  If God has disciplined you, pray about how and why you have sinned. God wants you to then repent and change your ways by renewing your mind daily (Ro. 12:2). He will then bless you with protection.</p></li>

<h2 id="peace-trust-god-and-he-will-give-you-peace-during-a-trial.-ps.-1255b."><strong>7. <u>Peace: Trust God, and He Will Give You Peace During a Trial</u>. Ps. 125:5b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>With faith and trust, God offers you peace</u>. The psalmist concluded with a prayer for peace. “<strong><sup>5b</sup></strong> <em>Peace be upon Israel</em>.” (Ps. 125:5b). “Those who cleave to the ways of God, though they may have trouble in their way, their end shall be peace. The pleading of their Saviour for them, secures to them the upholding power and preserving grace of their God. Lord, number us with them, in time, and to eternity.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 125:5).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="/psalm-125/media/image5.jpeg" style="width:5.5426in;height:2.61386in" alt="&quot;Prince of Peace&quot; by Yongsung Kim portrays Jesus reaching up to a dove in a field of flowers ..." /></p>
<p>Pray to Jesus for peace for yourself and for all His people<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Prince of Peace will restore peace throughout the world</u>. Jesus is the promised Prince of Peace: “For a Child will be born to us, a Son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called wonderful Counselor, mighty God, eternal Father, <em>Prince of Peace</em>.” (Is. 9:6). He will bring an end to all conflict. “And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young lion and the fattened steer will be together; and a little boy will lead them.” (Is. 11:6). ‘“The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil or harm on all My holy mountain,’ says the LORD.” (Is. 65:25). “But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.” (2 Pet. 3:13). Thus, believers have many reasons to be thankful and have hope.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When others attack you, find peace in Jesus</u>. The struggles that Jerusalem experienced correspond with the struggles that all believers experience in the world. When you encounter conflict, Jesus offers you His peace if you turn to Him in faith. “<em>Peace I leave you, My peace I give you</em>; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that <em>in Me you may have peace</em>. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). “And all who will follow this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.” (Gal. 6:16). “For <em>He Himself is our peace</em>, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “Peace be to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 6:23). “The LORD lift up His face to you, and give you peace.” (Nu. 6:26). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11). “Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, mend your ways, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (2 Chr. 13:11).</p></li>
