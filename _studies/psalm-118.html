<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 118 is a well-known psalm that directly foreshadows Jesus. First, this psalm celebrates God’s salvation that came through the rejected “<em>chief cornerstone</em>” (Ps. 118:22). No less than six New Testament books directly connect this verse to Jesus (Matt. 21:42; Mk. 12:10; Lk. 20:17; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:7). Second, this psalm declares, “<em>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>;” (Ps. 118:26). In all four Gospels, crowds sang these words as a praise for Jesus when He entered Jerusalem to be sacrificed for us (Matt. 21:9; 23:39; Mk. 11:9; Lk. 13:35; 19:38; Jo. 12:13). Third, this psalm concludes the six-part “Hallel” (<span dir="rtl">הַלֵּל</span>) Passover praises. Jesus was the Passover lamb of God (Jo. 1:29). He allowed death to “pass over” all who believe in Him (Jo. 3:16). As the “chief cornerstone” of the Church, Jesus offers several blessings for those who put their faith in Him. These include His: (1) loving mercy, (2) protection, (3) deliverance, (4) joy, (5) guidance, (6) salvation, and (7) grace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, to encourage the Jews, the psalmist praised God for His everlasting covenant of love and mercy. With faith, Jesus also offers you His covenant of love and mercy. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist also encouraged the Jews that it is better to trust in God than in powerful people. When God is with you, no one can harm you. With faith, Jesus also offers you His protection. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist encouraged the Jews by reminding them that God could deliver them from any hostile nation. With faith, Jesus also offers to deliver you from bondage, sin, oppression, and death. <u>Fourth</u>, even in the face of being disciplined, the psalmist proclaimed that he would shout for joy over God’s ultimate victory. With faith, Jesus offers you the joy of the Holy Spirit. This is true even during a trial or when He has disciplined you. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist declared with confidence that he would pass through God’s gate of righteousness. Jesus is the door through which all must pass. His path of righteousness is narrow. Few will find it. But with faith, Jesus offers to guide you on His path and allow you to enter His gate by making you righteous. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist prophetically gave thanks for his salvation and the rejected “chief cornerstone”. Jesus is the chief cornerstone of the Church. But many have sadly rejected what He offers. With faith, Jesus offers you His rock of eternal salvation. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist prophetically declared a blessing for the One who comes in the name of the Lord. This again pointed to Jesus. God the Father blessed Him. With faith, Jesus offers to pour out His grace and His blessings on you as well.</p>
<h2 id="loving-mercy-with-faith-jesus-offers-his-love-and-mercy.-ps.-1181-4."><strong>1. <u>Loving Mercy: With Faith, Jesus Offers His Love and Mercy</u>. Ps. 118:1-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God for His covenant mercy and love</u>. The psalmist thanked God for making His covenant available to any Jew and gentile who feared Him. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is good; for His mercy is everlasting. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Let Israel say, ‘His mercy is everlasting.’ <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Oh let the house of Aaron say, ‘His mercy is everlasting.’ <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Let those who fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> say, ‘His mercy is everlasting</em>.’” (Ps. 118:1-4). This praise focuses on God’s covenant “<em>Ḥesed</em>” aka “<em>Chesed</em>” (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>). In the NASB, the KJB, and the NKJB, this word is translated as God’s “<em>mercy</em>”. In the NIV, this word is translated as His “<em>love</em>”. Both translations are accurate. The word “<em>everlasting</em>” (NASB) or “<em>endureth</em>” (KJB) is also not in the Hebrew text. English translators added this word to establish that His covenant will never end. It actually translates as “‘<em>for His mercy forever.</em>’ That mercy had no beginning, and shall never know an end.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 118:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s covenant of mercy and love in your life</u>. God’s covenant of love and mercy ensured that God would remain faithful to fulfill His promises. Following the Jews’ deportation to Babylonian captivity, many believed that God had given up on them. But Ezra encouraged the Jews to trust in God’s faithfulness to keep His covenant promises to Israel. Thus, he led the Jews in a very similar praise when the Jews were able to lay the foundation of the Second Temple, including its cornerstone. “And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, ‘<em>For He is good, for His favor is upon Israel forever</em>.’ And all the people shouted with a great shout of joy when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.” (Ezra 3:11). Most likely during the post-exile time period, other psalms encouraged the Jews by restating God’s faithfulness to keep His covenant promises. “For the LORD is good; His mercy “<em>Ḥesed</em>” is everlasting and His faithfulness is to all generations.” (Ps. 100:5). “Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His mercy “<em>Ḥesed</em>” is everlasting.” (Ps. 106:1). “For His mercy “<em>Ḥesed</em>” toward us is great, and the truth of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is everlasting. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!” (Ps. 117:2). God’s faithfulness to keep His promises gave the Jews hope. You can also find hope in Jesus’ faithfulness.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus died at the cross to bring mankind everlasting mercy</u>. God is merciful in the face of our sins because He is filled with compassion and love: “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). “Then you will say on that day, “I will give thanks to You, LORD; for although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.” (Is. 12:1). “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you.” (Is. 54:7). “The Lord’s acts of mercy indeed do not end, for His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness<em>.”</em> (Lam. 3:22-23). Jesus died on the cross to bring us mercy by taking the penalty for our sins. “and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” (1 Jo. 2:2). “You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.” (1 Jo. 3:5). Thus, Jesus deserves your praise and thanksgiving for the terrible price He paid for you. You are also called to share His message of love and mercy with the lost.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent of your sins each day, and Jesus will forgive you</u>. On many occasions, David confessed his sins: “I acknowledged my sin to You, and I did not hide my guilt; I said, ‘I will confess my wrongdoings to the LORD’; and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah” (Ps. 32:5). “For I admit my guilt; I am full of anxiety because of my sin.” (Ps. 38:18). “Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin.” (Ps. 51:2). When you confess your sins, Jesus will forgive you: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). Every person has sins to confess. Are you confessing your sins to Jesus?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protection-with-faith-jesus-also-offers-you-his-protection.-ps.-1185-9."><strong>2. <u>Protection: With Faith, Jesus Also Offers You His Protection</u>. Ps. 118:5-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Take refuge in Jesus for your protection</u>. Most likely when Israel was a weak vassal state of the Persian empire, the psalmist encouraged the Jews to trust in God alone for their protection: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>From my distress I called upon the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> answered me and put me in an open space. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me? <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is for me among those who help me; therefore I will look with satisfaction on those who hate me. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in people. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in noblemen</em>.” (Ps. 118:5-9). Martin Luther found God’s promises of protection to be his greatest comfort during his times of persecution: “This is my psalm, my chosen psalm. I love them all; I love all holy Scripture, which is my consolation and my life. But this psalm is nearest my heart, and I have a peculiar right to call it mine. It has saved me from many a pressing danger, from which nor emperor, nor kings, nor sages, nor saints, could save me. It is my friend; dearer to me than all the honors and power of the earth.” (quoted by Steven J. Cole).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-118/media/image3.jpg" style="width:5.97996in;height:3.01022in" alt="Psalm 118:8 | Psalms, Psalm 118 8, Jesus" /></p>
<p>Place your trust in Jesus and not in powerful people for your protection<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Call upon Jesus when you are in need of protection</u>. The psalmist proclaimed, “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>From my distress I called upon the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> answered me and put me in an open space.</em>” (Ps. 118:5). In his times of distress, David also frequently proclaimed his faith that God would answer his cries for help. “I have called upon You, for You will answer me, God; incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.” (Ps. 17:6). “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears. . . He also brought me out into an open place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.” (Ps. 18:6, 19). “On the day of my trouble I will call upon You, for You will answer me.” (Ps. 86:7). When you need protection, call upon Jesus to protect you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you do God’s will, He will protect you</u>. With confidence, the psalmist knew that he did not need to fear evil people because God was with him. “<em><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me?</em>” (Ps. 118:6). Because he trusted God, David also knew that he did not need to fear evil people. “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; whom should I dread?” (Ps. 27:1). Through Isaiah, God directly told His people not to fear when serving Him. ‘“Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will also help you, I will also uphold you with My righteous right hand.”’ (Is. 41:10). These promises of God’s protection are repeated in the New Testament. “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). “so that we confidently say, ‘The LORD is my helper, I will not be afraid, what will man do to me?”’ (Heb. 13:6). If you are doing God’s will, He will protect you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When Jesus is your refuge, He will also be your shield to protect you from evil</u>. David knew he would prevail because he declared “God is my refuge<em>.</em>” (Ps. 59:9). “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:3). “The LORD will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). God protected David from Saul’s spear attacks (1 Sam. 19:8-10). He also protected David against Goliath’s attack from a giant spear (1 Sam. 17:7). He also protected David in his many battles against the Philistines. In all these instances, David trusted God to provide his spiritual armor: “Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:11-12). When you wear God’s armor, no weapon can harm you. “No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; . . .” (Is. 54:17). God also promises to be a shield to all who submit to Him: “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is tested; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (2 Sam. 22:31). “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5). Jesus invites you to seek His protection (Matt. 6:13). If you submit to Him, He will also be your hedge of protection.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not place your trust in yourself, powerful leaders, political parties, or government</u>. The psalmist declared, “<em><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in people. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in noblemen</em>.” (Ps. 118:8-9). The person who puts their trust in other persons instead of God is cursed. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the LORD.”’ (Jer. 17:5). Thus, David and other psalmists declared that they would place their trust in neither themselves or others. “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength.” (Ps. 33:16). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “Oh give us help against the enemy, for rescue by man is worthless.” (Ps. 60:11). “Give us help against the enemy, for deliverance by man is worthless.” (Ps. 108:12). “Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). In most western democracies, it is common for people to place their hope in their political candidate or political party to save them from their problems. Believers should be Jesus’ salt and light in an evil world. But believers are called upon to place their hope and trust in Him alone.</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-with-faith-jesus-also-offers-to-deliver-you.-ps.-11810-14."><strong>3. <u>Deliverance: With Faith, Jesus Also Offers to Deliver You</u>. Ps. 118:10-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus when you are under attack</u>. As an example to the Jews who likely felt defenseless following their return from exile, the psalmist proclaimed his unwavering confidence that God would deliver them from the many enemy nations around them: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>All nations surrounded me; in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will certainly fend them off. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me; in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will certainly fend them off. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>They surrounded me like bees; they were extinguished like a fire of thorn bushes; in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will certainly fend them off. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>You pushed me violently so that I was falling, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> helped me. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation</em>.” (Ps. 118:10-14). This likely referred to the enemies who conspired at different times against Israel. “The special compassing about alluded to is probably that in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, when not only the Babylonians but the Syrians, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Edomites took part in hostilities against Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm"><u>2 Kings 24:2</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm"><u>Psalm 137:7</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 118:11).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, Jesus can strengthen you to deliver you from the enemy’s attacks</u>. Because God had not abandoned His covenant with Israel, the psalmist did not fear his enemies: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>All nations surrounded me; in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will certainly fend them off. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me; in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> I will certainly fend them off.</em>” (Ps. 118:10-11). After the first exodus, God promised to deliver the Jews from their many enemies. “I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.” (Ex. 23:27). “This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the faces of people everywhere, who, when they hear the news of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.” (Dt. 2:25). Because David had faith in God’s promises to him, he also did not need to fear his enemies. “I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.” (Ps. 3:6). “For by You I can run at a troop of warriors; and by my God I can leap over a wall . . . You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, and I destroyed those who hated me.” (Ps. 18:29, 40). “GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head on the day of battle.” (Ps. 140:7). You can also be confident in Jesus’ promises to protect you when you serve Him. “Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation.” (Is. 12:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray and cry out to Jesus when you need His deliverance</u>. As our example, David repeatedly cried out to God for His protection and deliverance from evil: “The ropes of death encompassed me, and the torrents of destruction terrified me.” (Ps. 18:4). “Save me, God, for the waters have threatened my life. I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and a flood overflows me.” (Ps. 69:1-2). “Your wrath has rested upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah” (Ps. 88:7). “Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the wrongdoer and the ruthless,” (Ps. 71:4). “I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah”. (Ps. 77:3). “Out of the depths I have cried to You, LORD.” (Ps. 130:1). “A Psalm of David. Rescue me, LORD, from evil people; protect me from violent men . . . Keep me, LORD, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from violent men who intend to trip up my feet.” (Ps. 140:1, 4). You should also cry out when you are responsible for your trial: “Save me from all my wrongdoings; do not make me an object of reproach for the foolish. I have become mute, I do not open my mouth, because it is You who have done it.” (Ps. 39:8-9). Thus, regardless of whether you caused your own trial, cry out in prayer for Jesus’ deliverance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joy-with-faith-jesus-offers-you-joy-even-during-a-trial.-ps.-11815-18."><strong>4. <u>Joy: With Faith, Jesus Offers You Joy, Even During a Trial</u>. Ps. 118:15-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus during your trials</u>. The psalmist knew that he did not need to lead a depressed or anxious life while he waited for God to act. Instead, he stated that he would shout for joy because of God’s promised deliverance. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> performs valiantly. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The right hand of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is exalted; the right hand of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> performs valiantly. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>18</sup></strong> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has disciplined me severely, but He has not turned me over to death</em>.” (Ps. 118:15-18). “Whether the believer traces back his comfort to the everlasting goodness and mercy of God, or whether he looks forward to the blessing secured to him, he will find abundant cause for joy and praise. Every answer to our prayers is an evidence that the Lord is on our side; and then we need not fear what man can do unto us; we should conscientiously do our duty to all, and trust in him alone to accept and bless us. Let us seek to live to declare the works of God, and to encourage others to serve him and trust in him. Such were the triumphs of the Son of David, in the assurance that the good pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 118:1-18).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Find your joy in Jesus</u>. The psalmist stated that he would joyfully shout for all to hear. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The sound of joyful shouting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> performs valiantly.</em>” (Ps. 118:15). “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous ones; and shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.” (Ps. 32:11). “The righteous person will be glad in the LORD and take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart will boast.” (Ps. 64:10). “But the righteous will be joyful; they will rejoice before God; yes, they will rejoice with gladness.” (Ps. 68:3). Every person has something to be thankful for. Whenever you face a trial, find joy in Jesus’ blessings in your life.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your joy be part of your testimony</u>. The psalmist wanted to live so that he could boast to others about God’s wonderful works of faithfulness, mercy, and deliverance. “<em><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</em>” (Ps. 118:17). David and other psalmists also deserved to survive to sing of God’s wonders as their testimony to others. “Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; <em>declare His deeds among the peoples</em>.” (Ps. 9:11). “But as for me, the nearness of God is good for me; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, so that <em>I may tell of all Your works</em>.” (Ps. 73:28). “Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; <em>make His deeds known among the peoples</em>.” (Ps. 105:1). “They shall also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and <em>tell of His works with joyful singing</em>.” (Ps. 107:22). “Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; <em>make His deeds known among the peoples</em>.” (1 Chr. 16:8). When Jesus delivers you or performs a miracle, you should also share your testimony to encourage others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus only disciplines you out of love</u>. The psalmist knew that part of his struggles stemmed from God’s discipline. But he saw God’s mercy and grace in sparring him from death. “<em><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has disciplined me severely, but He has not turned me over to death</em>.” (Ps. 118:18). The Bible is clear that God disciplines believers out of love to restore them and bring them back to Him. “So you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5). “Blessed is the man whom You discipline, LORD, and whom You teach from Your Law,” (Ps. 94:12). “For whom the LORD loves He disciplines, and He punishes every son whom He accepts. It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?” (Heb. 12:6-7). “But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.” (1 Cor. 11:32). “Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.” (Rev. 3:19). Thus, if Jesus disciplines you because of some sin, do not assume that He has forsaken you. He instead seeks to restore you.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidance-with-faith-jesus-offers-to-guide-you-on-his-path.-ps.-11819-20."><strong>5. <u>Guidance: With Faith, Jesus Offers to Guide You on His Path</u>. Ps. 118:19-20.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus guide you on His narrow path to His narrow gate</u>. In the face of Israel’s trials, the psalmist called upon God to open the “gates of righteousness” to allow His people to pass into God’s holy presence: “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>Open the gates of righteousness to me; I will enter through them, I will give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>This is the gate of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; the righteous will enter through it</em>.” (Ps. 118:19-21). These words pointed to Jesus. But the Jewish audience would have understood this as referencing the Temple gates. “This is explained by the next verse as the gate of the Temple, where the righteous, <em>i.e., </em>Israel alone, entered. There does not seem the least reason for taking the words here in any but this literal sense, though doubtless they are capable of endless spiritual applications. We must imagine a procession chanting the triumphal song as in Psalms 24, and summoning the gates to open on its approach.” (Charles Ellocitt Commentary on Ps. 118:19).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God promised to make known to His people the narrow path leading to life</u>. David called upon God to make known the way leading to a life that lasted forever: “You will make known to me the <em>way of life</em>; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures <em>forever</em>.” (Ps. 16:11). God makes known His path through His Word: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). Isaiah also prophetically called upon God to open His gates for the “righteous nation”: “Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, the one that remains faithful.” (Is. 26:2). He warned that only fools would reject God’s holy path leading to His gate. “A highway will be there, a roadway, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks that way, and fools will not wander on it.” (Is. 35:8). Through prayer and the Word, the Spirit will guide you to His path.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus to find the narrow path leading to His door of eternal life</u>. Jesus warned that the path leading to eternal life is narrow. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14). Jesus is the door leading to eternal life. Unless you follow His path, you will never find His door. “And someone said to Him, ‘Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?’ And He said to them, strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.” (Lk. 13:23-24). If you have found His path, are you sharing the Good News with the lost?</p></li>

<h2 id="salvation-with-faith-jesus-offers-you-eternal-salvation.-ps.-11821-24."><strong>6. <u>Salvation: With Faith, Jesus Offers You Eternal Salvation</u>. Ps. 118:21-24.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the rejected chief cornerstone and the rock of your salvation</u>. Possibly during the laying of the foundation for the Second Temple under Ezra’s direction, the psalmist prophetically called God his salvation and the “chief cornerstone” that the builders rejected. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>I will give thanks to You, for You have answered me, and You have become my salvation. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>A stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>This came about from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; it is marvelous in our eyes. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>This is the day which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has made; let’s rejoice and be glad in it</em>.” (Ps. 118:21-24). “[Jesus] is the living stone, the tried stone, elect, precious, which God himself appointed from of old. The Jewish builders, scribe, priest, Pharisee, and Herodian, rejected him with disdain. They could see no excellence in him that they should build upon him; he could not be made to fit in with their ideal of a national church, he was a stone of another quarry from themselves, and not after their mind nor according to their taste; therefore they cast him away and poured contempt upon him, even as Peter said, ‘This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders’; they reckoned him to be as nothing, though he is Lord of all. In raising him from the dead the Lord God exalted him to be the head of his church, the very pinnacle of her glory and beauty.” (Charles Spurgeon on Psalm 118:22).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God promised that He would lay His “cornerstone”</u>. Through Isaiah, God promised to lay a “<em>precious cornerstone</em>”: “Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a <em>precious cornerstone</em> for the foundation, firmly placed. The one who believes in it will not be disturbed.”’ (Is. 28:16). Zechariah repeated this promise. “From them will come the <em>cornerstone</em>, from them the tent peg, from them the bow of battle, from them every tyrant, all of them together.” (Zech. 10:4).</p></li>

<p>Jesus is the promised cornerstone of our salvation, who was and is still rejected by many<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the promised “chief cornerstone”</u>. In one of His parables, “Jesus said to them, ‘Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘A stone which the builders rejected, this has become the <em>chief cornerstone</em>; this came about from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord,</span> and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” (Matt. 21:42; Mk. 12:10); Lk. 20:17). In the book of Acts, Ephesians, and 1 Peter, Jesus is revealed to be the promised chief cornerstone. “He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the <em>chief cornerstone</em>. And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among mankind by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:11-12). “having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the <em>cornerstone</em>, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,” (Eph. 2:20-21). “For this is contained in Scripture: ‘Behold, I am laying in Zion a choice stone, a <em>precious cornerstone</em>, and the one who believes in Him will not be put to shame.’ This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for unbelievers, ‘A stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief cornerstone,’” (1 Pet. 2:6-7). “<strong>The stone which the builders rejected</strong>: It was true of Jacob, Joseph and David – each were rejected and then raised high. It was most certainly true of Jesus. · They didn’t approve of His origin (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+7.52&amp;t=NKJV"><u>John 7:52</u></a>). · They didn’t approve of His lack of formal education (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+7.15&amp;t=NKJV"><u>John 7:15</u></a>). · They didn’t approve of His disregard for religious traditions (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.2&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Luke 6:2</u></a>). · They didn’t approve of His choice of friends (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+9.11&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 9:11</u></a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 118).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for what the day of Jesus’ resurrection made possible for those with faith</u>. The psalmist declared praises for those with faith to see what God had done: <em>“This came about from the LORD; it is marvelous in our eyes</em>. <em>This is the day which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has made; let’s rejoice and be glad in it</em>.” (Ps. 118:23-24). This pointed to the day of Jesus’ resurrection. “This came about from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and it is marvelous in our eyes?” (Mk. 12:11). ‘“Of the day on which Christ arose from the dead, it may, with more propriety than of any other day, be affirmed, <strong>this is the day which Jehovah hath made.</strong> Then it was that the <strong>rejected stone became the head of the corner.</strong> A morning then dawned, which is to be followed by no evening; a brighter sun arose upon the world, which is to set no more; a day began which will never end; and night and darkness departed to return not again. Easter-day is, in a peculiar manner, consecrated to him who, by his resurrection, triumphed over death and hell.” (Benson’s Commentary on Ps. 118:24).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grace-with-faith-jesus-offers-to-pour-out-his-blessings.-ps.-11825-29."><strong>7. <u>Grace: With Faith, Jesus Offers to Pour Out His Blessings</u>. Ps. 118:25-29.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for sharing His blessings with you</u>. Even though the Jews’ troubles had not yet lifted, the psalmist prophetically gave thanks for the one who would come in the name of the Lord to bless His people. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>Please, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, do save us; please, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, do send prosperity! <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; we have blessed you from the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is God, and He has given us light; bind the festival sacrifice to the horns of the altar with cords. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>You are my God, and I give thanks to You; You are my God, I exalt You. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is good; for His mercy is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 118:25-29). Psalm 118:25 is a prayer for Israel’s prosperity to be restored. A similar prayer appears in Psalm 122:6-7. Jesus would fulfill that prayer. The remainder of this psalm pointed to Jesus’ final days.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the blessed one who came to bless His people</u>. The psalmist declared, “<em><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>;”</em> (Ps. 118:26). In all four Gospels, crowds sang these exact words as a praise for Jesus when He entered Jerusalem to be sacrificed for mankind: “Now the crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, ‘Hosanna to the Son of David; <em>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>; Hosanna in the highest!”’ (Matt. 21:9; Mk. 11:9). “And as soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen, shouting: ‘<em>Blessed is</em> the King, <em>the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>; ‘peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”’ (Lk. 19:37-38). “they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began shouting, ‘Hosanna! <em>Blessed is</em> He <em>who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>, indeed, the King of Israel!’” (Jo. 12:13). “For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, ‘<em>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em><span class="smallcaps">!’”</span> (Matt. 23:39; Lk. 13:35). You also have reasons to praise Jesus. Out of grace, He seeks to pour out His blessings upon all who believe in Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the light of the world</u>. Various psalmists gave thanks that God shared His light with His people. “<em><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is God, and He has given us light; . . .</em>” (Ps. 118:27a). “For You light my lamp; the <em>LORD my God illumines my darkness</em>.” (Ps. 18:28). “A Psalm of David. The <em>LORD is my light</em> and my salvation; . . .” (Ps. 27:1a). Jesus is the light of the world (Jo. 8:12). Out of grace, He seeks to share His light with you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Psalm 118 foreshadowed Jesus’ final days leading to His crucifixion</u>. Many have observed how Psalm 118 pointed to Jesus’ final days before going to the cross. “Thou art my God, I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good (Psa 118:28-29): Now this being the traditional psalm that they sang at the Passover feast, it is interesting that as Jesus sang it with His disciples, they were actually already singing a psalm that had had its fulfillment a few days earlier. For a few days earlier they were crying, ‘Hosanna, blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’ A few days earlier, the stone was rejected by the builders. And so they were singing of that the night before His crucifixion. ‘Bind the sacrifice with cords to the altar.’” (Chuck Smith on Ps. 118:28-29).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> “We have a strange prediction that was fulfilled precisely. This deliverer was to be welcomed with open gates (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+118.19&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 118:19</a>), hosannas (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+118.25&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 118:25</a>), and blessings (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+118.26&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 118:26</a>). Yet He is and was the same chief cornerstone that would be rejected (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+118.22&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 118:22</a>). Exactly according to the words and spirit of this psalm, Jesus was welcomed as deliverer and Messiah on Palm Sunday, and rejected and crucified only a few days later.” (David Guzik on Ps. 118:28-29).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus was greeted with shouts of joy, but He knew He would soon be sacrificed<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because His covenant love and mercy is everlasting</u>. The psalm concludes by repeating the call for God’s people to thank Him for His covenant love and mercy. “<em><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is good; for His mercy is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 118:25-29). “A Psalm of David. <em>I will exalt You</em>, LORD, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:11). “<em>Exalt the LORD</em> our God and worship at His footstool; Holy is He.” (Ps. 99:5). “LORD, You are my God; <em>I will exalt You</em>, I will give thanks to Your name; for You have worked wonders, plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.” (Is. 25:1). Jesus also deserves your praise and worship.</p></li>
