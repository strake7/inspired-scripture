<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 91 has no listed author. Some believe that Moses wrote it. But the Greek Septuagint (circa the Third Century B.C.) begins this psalm with the words: “Praise of a Song, by David.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> While the author of this psalm may be debated, the importance of this psalm is not. The famous British preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834<strong> -</strong>1892 A.D.) observed: “In the whole collection there is not a more cheering Psalm, its tone is elevated and sustained throughout, faith is at its best, and speaks nobly.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 91).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Here, God reveals seven blessings that come from placing your trust in Him, including: (1) protection, (2) deliverance, (3) His loving embrace, (4) confidence, (5) justice, (6) guardian angels, and (7) salvation.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist declared that he would trust God to be His refuge. If you place your trust in God, He will also protect you. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist cried out for God to deliver him. If you trust in God alone, He will also deliver you. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist promised believers that trusting God would result in Him embracing you the same way a mother bird protects its helpless chicks. When you trust God, His loving embrace will also surround you and protect you. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist proclaimed that he had no fear because he trusted God. When you trust God, He will also give you confidence and strength. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist promised that trusting God would result in God taking care of a believer’s enemies. When you trust God, He will also be just and fair with you. This includes righting the wrongs against you. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist promised that God would send guardian angels to protect those who trust Him. If you trust God, His angels will also protect you. <u>Finally</u>, God spoke through the psalmist to promise other blessings for those who trust Him, including eternal life. If you trust in God and the atoning sacrifice that His only son Jesus Christ made for you at the cross, He will also offer you eternal life.</p>
<h2 id="protection-if-you-place-your-trust-in-god-he-will-protect-you.-ps.-911-2."><strong>1. <u>Protection: If You Place Your Trust in God, He Will Protect You</u>. Ps. 91:1-2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust God be your refuge, and He will protect you</u>. The psalmist declared that He would draw close to God and trust Him alone to be his refuge: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>One who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will lodge in the shadow of the Almighty. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>I will say to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust!</em>’” (Ps. 91:1-2). “These first two verses of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+91&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 91</a> use four wonderful titles or names for God: · <strong>Most High</strong>: <em>Elyon.</em> · <strong>Almighty</strong>: <em>Shadday</em>. · <strong>The LORD</strong>: <em>Yahweh</em>. · <strong>My God</strong>: <em>Elohay</em>. <strong>He is my refuge and my fortress</strong>: The one who lives intimately with God knows the greatness of His protection. God Himself becomes like a mighty <strong>refuge</strong> and <strong>fortress</strong> for the believer.” (David Guzik on Ps. 91:1-2) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> “God will extend his ‘shadow’ over the man who places himself under his protection.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 91:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is a shield to those who take refuge in Him</u>.  In the Third Century B.C., rabbis concluded that David was the author of this psalm because he repeatedly used similar words in professing his trust in God as his shield and his refuge:  “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2). “He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.”  (2 Sam. 22:31).  “But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the One who lifts my head.”  (Ps. 3:3).  “For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12). “For on the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; He will hide me in the secret place of His tent; He will lift me up on a rock.” (Ps. 27:5). “The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart triumphs, and with my song I shall thank Him.” (Ps. 28:7). “You hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the conspiracies of mankind; You keep them secretly in a shelter from the strife of tongues.” (Ps. 31:20). “You are my hiding place; You keep me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah” (Ps. 32:7). “You are my hiding place and my shield; I wait for Your word.” (Ps. 119:114). David’s son Solomon also professed his trust in God as his shield and as his refuge: “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.”  (Prov. 30:5). When God is your refuge, He will also be your shield and protect you.</p></li>

<p>Place your trust in God, and He will be close to you and protect you<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust in God and lean not on your own understanding</u>.  Faith requires that you trust God, even when you feel you can handle things on your own: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.”  (Prov. 3:5).  “He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks wisely will be delivered.”  (Prov. 28:26). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus be your refuge in the wilderness</u>.  Jesus is called the chief shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4), the good shepherd (Jo. 10:11), and the great shepherd (Heb. 13:20).  It is in Him that we “have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.”  (Heb. 6:18).  “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). “Each will be like a refuge from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry country, like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.”  (Is. 32:2). Have you turned to Jesus as your refuge when you are under attack?</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-if-you-trust-in-god-alone-he-will-deliver-you.-ps.-913."><strong>2. <u>Deliverance: If You Trust in God Alone, He Will Deliver You</u>. Ps. 91:3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God for your deliverance from Satan’s attacks</u>. The psalmist declared that trusting God would bring the blessing of His deliverance to you from Satan’s snares and plagues: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>For it is He who rescues you from the net of the trapper and from the deadly plague</em>.” (Ps. 91:3). “In Biblical times, a fowler was someone who caught birds with traps and snares. A snare is a type of trap used to capture birds. A fowler would place traps in places where birds congregate, such as trees, caves, and waterways. After setting the trap, the fowler would hide in plain sight and wait for an unsuspecting bird to set it off. The snare caught the bird when it set off the trap. The fowler would then capture the bird and slaughter it. The fowler in <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2091.3">Psalm 91:3</a> represents Satan, as well as manipulative and exploitative people who use evil tactics to entice us into falling into sin and compromising our faith. This metaphor is apt because Satan is portrayed in scripture as a skilled manipulator (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%208.44">John 8:44</a>) and deceiver (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Pet%205.8%E2%80%939">1 Peter 5:8–9</a>), much like a fowler. . . A noisome pestilence is a plague or a deadly pandemic-level disease that spreads quickly and causes great suffering and death. However, the phrase ‘noisome pestilence’ is also associated with misfortunes, calamities, and nocturnal demonic activities that cause widespread death.” (Pastor Martin Kiogora Rutere on Ps. 91:3).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God to deliver you when the enemy attacks you</u>. When David was attacked, he trusted God to deliver him: “My God, in You I trust, do not let me be ashamed; do not let my enemies rejoice over me. . . Guard my soul and save me; do not let me be ashamed, for I take refuge in You.” (Ps. 25:2, 20). “Call upon Me on the day of trouble; I will rescue you, and you will honor Me.” (Ps. 50:12). “Protect my soul, for I am godly; You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.” (Ps. 86:2). “Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, and from the snares of those who do wrong.” (Ps. 141:9). At a time when Judah faced three enemy armies, Jehoshaphat also professed his trust in God to deliver His people: “‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, or judgment, or plague, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You (for Your name is in this house), and cry out to You in our distress, and You will hear and save us.’” (2 Chr. 20:9). God heard Jehoshaphat’s faithful cry by delivering Judah (2 Chr. 20:18-25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t place your trust in worldly things for your deliverance</u>. When you rely upon the things of the world to deliver you, you are telling God that you don’t need Him. The result is frequently disastrous. For example, when the Jews turned to Egypt for protection, their enemies defeated them: “Then they will be terrified and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their pride.” (Is. 20:5). “Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.” (Is. 30:8). “Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD!” (Is. 31:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith in God to deliver you</u>. David had faith in God because He had been faithful to deliver him throughout his entire life. “And David said, ‘The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” (1 Sam. 17:37(a)). God also wants you to be assured that Jesus will deliver you as well. “The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.” (2 Tim. 4:18). The Bible is filled with countless examples to prove that God is faithful. If your faith is lacking, study His Word and keep a prayer journal with His answered prayers.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith that God is stronger than any evil that you will ever face</u>. In the Lord’s prayer, Jesus encouraged believers to pray: “And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” (Matt. 6:13). “But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.” (2 Thess. 3:3). God wants you to have faith that the Holy Spirit inside of you is greater than any spiritual adversary that you will ever face. “You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31; Ps. 118:6; Heb. 13:6). Jonathan also encouraged David that Saul would never capture or harm him: “ Thus he said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, because the hand of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.”’ (1 Sam. 23:17). Satan is as powerless in God’s presence as Saul was in his attempts to thwart God’s will and kill David. Do you also trust in God’s power over all evil?</p></li>

<h2 id="love-when-you-trust-god-his-loving-embrace-surrounds-you.-ps.-914."><strong>3. <u>Love: When You Trust God, His Loving Embrace Surrounds You</u>. Ps. 91:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you are in need, meditate on God’s deep love for you</u>. The psalmist encouraged believers to trust in God’s embrace the same way a helpless chick might depend upon its mother: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you may take refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and wall</em>.” (Ps. 91:4). “That God himself will be their protector; those must needs be safe who have him for their keeper, and successful for whom he undertakes (v.4): . . . By natural instinct she [the hen] not only protects them [her chicks], but calls them under that protection when she sees them in danger, not only keeps them safe, but cherishes them and keeps them warm. To this the great God is pleased to compare his care of his people, who are helpless as the chickens, and easily made a prey of, but are invited to trust under the shadow of the wings of the divine promise and providence, . . God is willing to guard his people as the hen is to guard the chickens, and as able as a man of war in armour.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 91).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you keep your heart focused on God, He will guard you from evil</u>. The psalmist promised that God will keep believers who trust Him under the protection of His wings (Ps. 91:4). David made other similar appeals to God: “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings” (Ps. 17:8). “A Mikhtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, for my soul takes refuge in You; and in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.” (Ps. 57:1). Moses also gave similar descriptions of God’s protective embrace: “You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to Myself.” (Ex. 19:4). “As an eagle stirs up its nest, and hovers over its young, He spread His wings, He caught them, He carried them on His pinions.” (Dt. 32:11). The book of Ruth contains a similar description of God: “May the LORD reward your work, and may your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” (Ruth 2:12). God wants you to meditate on His love and find peace in knowing that He will embrace and protect you.</p></li>

<p>Trust in God, and He will surround you with His loving embrace<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus embraces you because He loves you</u>. When the world turns against you, know that Jesus loves you so much that He died on the cross for you: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16; 2 Cor. 1:3-4). Thus, like a loving parent, He embraces you with His love when you feel discouraged: “But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus;” (2 Cor. 7:6). “I, I Myself, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you are afraid of mortal man, and of a son of man who is made like grass,” (Is. 51:12). When you feel unloved, let Jesus embrace you with His love.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="confidence-when-you-trust-god-he-gives-you-confidence.-ps.-915-7."><strong>4. <u>Confidence: When You Trust God, He Gives You Confidence</u>. Ps. 91:5-7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust God, and He will bless you with confidence and strength</u>. When you do God’s will and trust Him, He will strengthen you and help to overcome your fears: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>You will not be afraid of the terror by night, or of the arrow that flies by day; <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>of the plague that stalks in darkness, or of the destruction that devastates at noon. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>A thousand may fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not approach you</em>.” (Ps. 91:5-7). Today, when you trust God, the Holy Spirit will empower and strengthen you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will give you confidence when you trust Him</u>. Because David trusted God, he did not fear his enemies: “I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.” (Ps. 3:6). “If an army encamps against me, my heart will not fear; if war arises against me, in spite of this I am confident.” (Ps. 27:3). Nor did David fear death: “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.” (Ps. 23:4). David also placed his trust in God when he faced Goliath. God then blessed David with confidence and strength: “This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I will strike you and remove your head from you. Then I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that this entire assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’S, and He will hand you over to us!” (1 Sam. 17:46-47). David even had the courage to run toward Goliath when Goliath charged at him: “Then it happened, when the Philistine came closer to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.” (1 Sam. 17:48). When you trust God, He will also give you confidence to face evil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, God gives you a Spirit of courage</u>.  When you trust God, He will give you a Spirit of strength and courage, not fear: “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7).  Yet, without faith, it is impossible to please Him (Heb. 11:6).  Are you trusting God and acting boldly to serve Him? </p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="justice-trust-god-and-he-will-be-just-and-fair-with-you.-ps.-918-10."><strong>5. <u>Justice: Trust God, and He Will be Just and Fair With You</u>. Ps. 91:8-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you trust God, you can leave vengeance to Him</u>. The psalmist encouraged believers that God will right the wrongs against you when you place your trust in Him: “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>You will only look on with your eyes and see the retaliation against the wicked. <strong><sup>9</sup></strong> For you have made the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>No evil will happen to you, nor will any plague come near your tent</em>.” (Ps. 91:8-10). Because God is in control, you can trust Him to address any evil in the world in His perfect timing.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God defeated the Jews’ enemies when they trusted God and obeyed Him</u>. Throughout the Old Testament, God was faithful to defeat those who attacked His people. They only needed to trust and obey God. For example, when an army of Ethiopians threatened to destroy Judah, King Asa called out to God. God then defeated the Ethiopian army: “Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, ‘LORD, there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; help us, LORD our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. LORD, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You.’ So the LORD routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.” (2 Chr. 14:11-12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are attacked, don’t try to right the wrongs against you</u>. Even though David was a mighty war hero, he never placed his trust in himself or in his own army: “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength.” (Ps. 33:16). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “Oh give us help against the enemy, for rescue by man is worthless.” (Ps. 60:11). “Give us help against the enemy, for deliverance by man is worthless.” (Ps. 108:12). “Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). God also does not want you to rely upon yourself or seek your own vengeance when you are attacked.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rejoice and worship God because He is faithful to avenge any wrongs against you</u>. From beginning to end, the Bible reminds believers to turn to God in the face of any trial and find joy by worshiping God because He will one day right all wrongs: “Rejoice, you nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and will return vengeance on His adversaries, and will atone for His land and His people.” (Dt. 32:43). “Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are eliminated, you will see it.” (Ps. 37:34). “The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.” (Ps. 58:10). “The upright see it and are glad; but all injustice shuts its mouth.” (Ps. 107:42). “and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who live on the earth?” (Rev. 6:10). The next time an enemy attacks you, give God praise because He has already won the battle.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guardian-angels-trust-god-and-his-angels-will-protect-you.-ps.-9111-13."><strong>6. <u>Guardian Angels: Trust God, and His Angels Will Protect You</u>. Ps. 91:11-13.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you trust God, He will also send angels to protect you</u>. The psalmist also promised that God would send guardian angels to watch over those who place their trust in Him: “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>For He will give His angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>On their hands they will lift you up, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>You will walk upon the lion and cobra, You will trample the young lion and the serpent</em>.” (Ps. 91:11-13). You can trust God’s angels. They can defeat Satan merely by rebuking them in Jesus’ name: “But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him an abusive judgment, but said, ‘The Lord rebuke you!’” (Jude 1:9). When His angels protect you, snakes, scorpions, and other dangerous animals have no power to harm you (Lk. 10:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God sent guardian angels to protect His people when they trusted Him</u>. Throughout the Bible, God sent angels to protect His people when they placed their trust in Him. For example, Elisha’s servant became filled with fear when an army of Arameans surrounded them. Elisha then prayed, and God showed him that an army of angels encamped around them: “Then Elisha prayed and said, ‘LORD, please, open his eyes so that he may see.’ And the LORD opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.” As another example, when King Sennacherib of Assyria blasphemed God and threatened Jerusalem, King Hezekiah prayed for God to deliver His people (2 Kgs. 19:1-19). God then sent the angel of the LORD, who killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers: “Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when the rest got up early in the morning, behold, all of the 185,000 were dead.” (2 Kgs. 19:35; 2 Chr. 32:31; Is. 37:36). God also has many guardian angels who are ready to protect you: “The chariots of God are myriads, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them as at Sinai, in holiness.” (Ps. 68:17). “For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and His chariots like the whirlwind, to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.” (Is. 66:15). These promises are repeated in the New Testament: “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to provide service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?” (Heb. 1:14). Thus, you can trust God to send His angels to protect you from evil. “The LORD will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul.” (Ps. 121:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God deliver you from evil</u>. Even though David was Israel’s mightiest war hero, he did use his own might, his soldiers, or his allies to fight back against his attackers. God also warns that you cannot trust in rulers or in government for your deliverance. He wants you to put your faith and trust in Him alone: “Do not trust in princes, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.” (Ps. 118:9). “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Do you trust in God alone to deliver you?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Be on guard for Satan’s attempts to twist God’s promises</u>. Satan knows of God’s promises. Because Satan cannot defeat Jesus or His angels, Satan resorts to lies and deceit. Satan misquoted God’s promise in Psalm 91 in a failed effort to deceive Jesus in the wilderness: “and he said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will give His angels orders concerning you’; and ‘on their hands they will left you up, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.’” (Matt. 4:6; Lk. 4:10-11). Jesus then rebuked Satan by quoting from Deuteronomy: “Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the LORD your God to the test.’” (Matt. 4:7; Lk. 4:12; Dt. 6:16). Thus, you should know God’s Word well enough to prevent Satan from deceiving you or causing you to try to put God to the test.</p></li>

<h2 id="salvation-trust-in-god-and-he-will-offer-you-eternal-life.-ps.-9114-16."><strong>7. <u>Salvation: Trust in God, and He Will Offer You Eternal Life</u>. Ps. 91:14-16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The greatest blessing from trusting God is salvation through Jesus</u>. The psalmist concluded that trust in God offered the blessings of protection, answered prayers, deliverance, honor, a prolonged life, and salvation: “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>‘<em>Because he has loved Me, I will save him; I will set him securely on high, because he has known My name. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He will call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will satisfy him with a long life, and show him My salvation</em>.’” (Ps. 91: 14-16). Thus, God has multiple blessings for those who place their trust in Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trusting God brings the blessing of answered prayers</u>.  God promised that He would hear the prayers of those who trust Him (Ps. 91:15). As a sign of his faith, David also praised God in advance for answering his prayer and protecting him: “I was crying out to the LORD with my voice, and <em>He answered me</em> from His holy mountain.” (Ps. 3:4).  “A Psalm of David. <em>Answer me</em> when I call, God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.” (Ps. 4:1). “I have called upon You, for <em>You will answer me</em>, God; incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.”  (Ps. 17:6).  “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; <em>He heard my voice from His temple</em>, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears.”  (Ps. 18:6).  “For I wait for You, LORD; <em>You will answer</em>, Lord my God.”  (Ps. 38:15).  If you fail to believe in the power of prayer, God is less likely to answer you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Thank God when He answers your prayers</u>. David also made a habit of thanking God when He answered David’s prayers: “I was crying out to the LORD with my voice, and <em>He answered me</em> from His holy mountain.  Selah”  (Ps. 3:4).  “But know that the LORD has set apart the godly person for Himself; <em>the LORD hears</em> when I call to Him.”  (Ps. 4:3).  “Leave me, all you who practice injustice, for <em>the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping</em>.”  (Ps. 6:8).  “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; <em>He heard my voice</em> from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears.”  (Ps. 18:6).  “Blessed be the LORD, because <em>He has heard the sound of my pleading</em>.”  (Ps. 28:6). Thus, David always praised God:  “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His faithfulness is everlasting.”  (1 Chr. 16:34).  If you fail to make a habit of thanking Him, you may take Him for granted.  Even in times when he was jailed and persecuted, Paul worshiped God and gave thanks: “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;”  (Eph. 5:20). Are you thanking God for the prayers that He has already answered and the future ones?</p></li>

<p>God’s many blessings that flow from trusting Him include salvation<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust in God makes possible a prolonged life</u>. God also promises: “<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will satisfy him with a long life,</em>” (Ps. 91:16). “so that you, your son, and your grandson will fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that <em>your days may be prolonged</em>.” (Dt. 6:2). “And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, then <em>I will prolong your days</em>.” (1 Kgs. 3:14). You may not immediately know if God has extended your life. Yet, when you get to heaven, you will learn how long He extended your life: “Length of days is always viewed in the Old Testament as a blessing, and a special reward for obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2, 16</a>, etc.). It is only in the New Testament that we learn how much ‘better’ it is ‘to depart, and be with Christ’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 91).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Thus, there are many rewards for trusting God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in God makes possible your eternal salvation</u>. God also promised: “<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will … show him My salvation</em>.’” (Ps. 91:16). Another reason why many believe David wrote this is that he had the faith to repeatedly thank God for his salvation: “For <em>You will not abandon my soul to Sheol</em>; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay. You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures <em>forever</em>.” (Ps. 16:10-11). “<em>To rescue their soul from death</em> and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:19-20). “But <em>God will redeem my soul</em> from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For <em>You have saved my soul from death</em>, indeed my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living.” (Ps. 56:13). “God is to us a <em>God of salvation</em>; and to GOD the Lord belong ways of escape from death.” (Ps. 68:20). “Help us, <em>God of our salvation</em>, for the glory of Your name; and save us and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.” (Ps. 79:9). “<em>You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol</em>.” (Ps. 86:13). Through Jesus, this offer also extends to you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Salvation is possible through Jesus’ atoning death on the cross</u>. Salvation was a mystery in Old Testament times (E.g., Ps. 6:5; Is. 38:18). But you can rely upon Jesus’ eternal promises of salvation: “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;” (Ro. 10:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for your salvation</u>. The Psalms remind believers to give thanks for all God’s blessings: “But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; <em>my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation</em>.” (Ps. 13:5). “That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving and declare all Your wonders.” (Ps. 26:7). “God, You have taught me from my youth, and I still declare Your wondrous deeds.” (Ps. 71:17). “A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks to You, God, we give thanks, for Your name is near; people declare Your wondrous works.” (Ps. 75:1). “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>I will give thanks to You, Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name forever.” (Ps. 86:12). Jesus also deserves your praise. You can also show your gratitude by making your life a living sacrifice to Him (Ro. 12:1).</p></li>
