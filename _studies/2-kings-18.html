Kings 18: Lessons from Hezekiah on Developing and Maintaining Your
Obedience to God.</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: The final seven chapters of 2 Kings are devoted
to the Kingdom of Judah. During this time, Judah had two of its greatest
kings, Hezekiah and Josiah. Because of their obedience, Judah lasted 136
years longer than Northern Israel (722 B.C. to 586 B.C.) From the
beginning part of Hezekiah’s reign, God reveals seven lessons for
developing and maintaining obedience to Him. These include: (1) having
faith, (2) being Spirit-led, (3) fearing only God, (4) patience for
God’s timing, (5) being Kingdom-minded, (6) knowing the Word, and (7)
dependence on God.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Hezekiah was the first king to fully follow God’s Word
in smashing pagan altars anywhere they existed. With the exception of
David, God faulted every king before him for failing to do this.
Hezekiah had the faith to follow God’s Word as it is written and ignore
public opinion and tradition. From his example, God reveals that faith
in Him produces the fruit of obedience. <u>Second</u>, Hezekiah let the
Spirit guide him to break off a treaty with Assyria that made Judah a
vassal state and to invade the Philistine territory of Gaza. From his
examples, God reveals that being Spirit-led helps to maintain your
obedience. <u>Third</u>, Hezekiah and all of Judah witnessed the
Assyrian army destroy the larger nation of Northern Israel. This later
caused Hezekiah to fear the Assyrians and pay them tribute. From his
mistake, God reveals that fearing your enemies can lead to disobedience.
<u>Fourth</u>, after losing all of his fortified cities except for
Jerusalem, Hezekiah lost patience in God’s promises. He apologized to
the Assyrians and paid them tribute. He assumed that God would not stop
the Assyrians. From his mistake, God reveals that you must trust in His
timing to maintain your obedience. <u>Fifth</u>, the Assyrians then
taunted the Jews for believing that they could look to Egypt to protect
them. From their mistake, God reveals that turning to the world can lead
to disobedience. <u>Sixth</u>, the Assyrians then tried to manipulate
God’s Word to question the Jews’ obedience in destroying pagan altars
and to misquote Isaiah’s prophecies to claim that God had sent them.
From the Assyrians’ attempt to manipulate the Jews, God reveals that
knowing His Word will help you to obey Him. <u>Finally</u>, the
Assyrians blasphemed God and taunted the Jews for believing that they
could depend upon God. Satan will also try to sow doubt in your faith or
attack you. God wants you to respond to these attacks by depending upon
Him. This will help you stay obedient to Him.</p>

<u>Faith: Faith in God (and Not Tradition) Produces the Fruit of
Obedience.</u> 2 Kgs. 18:1-6.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah reigns in faith-led obedience</u>. After living under
the reign of one of the worst kings of Judah, God blessed Judah with the
reformer king Hezekiah. He removed the many pagan altars from the
country and restored proper worship: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now it came about
in the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah king of Israel, that
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. <sup>2 </sup>He was
twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine
years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of
Zechariah. <sup>3 </sup>He did right in the sight of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to all that his father David
had done. <sup>4 </sup>He removed the high places and broke down the
sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the
bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the sons of
Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan.
<sup>5 </sup>He trusted in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the
kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him. <sup>6 </sup>For he
clung to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; he did not depart from
following Him, but kept His commandments, which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses</em>.” (2 Kgs. 18:1-6;
2 Chr. 29:1-2). Hezekiah was the King of Judah for 29 years, from 727 to
686 B.C. His name means “Yahweh Has Strengthened”. His name summarized
what God did for him. Each time he stepped out in faith-led obedience,
God strengthened him and blessed him to endure Satan’s attacks.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah had the faith to destroy all the idols when every
king before him failed to do so</u>. Following the evil reign of his
father Ahaz, Hezekiah smashed the pagan idols in Judah, and he restored
proper worship both in the Temple and throughout the country: “Has not
the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and said to
Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and on it you
shall burn incense?”’ (2 Chron. 32:12). “Thus Hezekiah did throughout
all Judah; and he did what was good, right and true before the LORD his
God.” (2 Chron. 31:20; 30:1-27; 29:2-36). “After his father had turned
Judah into a vassal state of Assyria, Hezekiah also revolted against
Assyrian domination in or around 705 B.C. The Bible records that “<em>He
did right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.”
(2 Kgs. 18:3). Besides Hezekiah, only two other kings of Judah had this
honor. The second was Josiah (2 Kgs. 22:2). A third king named Asa also
held this honor at the beginning of his reign (1 Kgs. 15:11). Yet, he
then refused to remove the pagan high places, and he used the gold in
the Temple to form an alliance with the Syrians against Northern Israel
(1 Kgs. 15:14, 18-22). Thus, there are only two kings of Judah who can
be considered to be holy throughout their reigns. Unlike all the prior
kings of Judah and the Kings of Northern Israel, Hezekiah trusted in
God, and he stayed faithful and obedient (2 Kgs. 18:5). But this did not
mean that he did not sin. Instead, he was righteous because he repented
to God when he sinned (e.g., 2 Kgs. 20:3; Is. 38:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah had the faith to fully obey God’s Word when no other
king would do so</u>. Sadly, Hezekiah was the first king of Judah to
obey God’s commanded to destroy the pagan high places that God commanded
that Jews destroy “You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor
do according to their deeds; <em>but you shall utterly overthrow them
and break their sacred pillars in pieces</em>.” (Ex. 23:24; 34:13; Dt.
12:2-7, 13-14). As part of his zeal for purity before God, he destroyed
the bronze serpent (the “Nehushtan”) that God used to save the Jews in
the wilderness (Nu. 21:4-9). The Nehushtan foreshadowed Jesus’ death on
the cross (Jo. 3:14-15). Yet, the Jews had turned it into an idol. Thus,
Hezekiah destroyed it to keep the Jews’ worship on God (2 Kgs. 18:4).
All his actions required incredible faith. Many would have questioned
why they needed to obey all of God’s laws when the prior kings refused
to do so. Your obedience also requires faith. Most people do not obey
all of God’s Word because their church leaders don’t do this. Yet, God
wants you to read His Word and let the Spirit apply it. You should never
let public opinion or tradition decide whether you fully obey God’s
Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>.
Hezekiah was a role model because his faith produced the fruit of
obedience. Without works, a person’s faith is dead: “Even so faith, if
it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” (Jam. 2:17) A believer may
proclaim Jesus as Lord. But Jesus is not your Lord if you disobey Him:
“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of
heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will
enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do
what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and
not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22). “Therefore
everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared
to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24). “Everyone
who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a
foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt. 7:26). Is your
faith evidenced through obedience to Jesus’ Word?</p></li>

<u>Spirit-Led: Being Spirit-Led Helps to Maintain Your Obedience.</u> 2
Kgs. 18:7-8.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God blesses Hezekiah for his Spirit-led obedience</u>.
Whenever Hezekiah acted in Spirit-led obedience, God was faithful to
keep His promises to bless Hezekiah and all of Judah:
“<sup>7 </sup><em>And the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with
him; wherever he went he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of
Assyria and did not serve him. <sup>8 </sup>He defeated the Philistines
as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified
city</em>.” (2 Kgs. 18:7-8). God prohibited His people from forming
treaties with pagan nations (Dt. 7:2). Even though Assyria was far more
powerful than Judah, Hezekiah followed the direction of the Spirit to
break the treaty that his father Ahaz negotiated with king
Tiglath-pileser of Assyria. The treaty turned Judah into a mere vassal
state of Assyria (2 Kgs. 16:7-8). Out of obedience to the Spirit, he
also invaded the Philistine territory of Gaza. But this was also a
vassal state of Assyria, Hezekiah’s actions guaranteed that Assyria
would invade Judah.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you let the Spirit guide you, your enemy will also flee
from you</u>. When you walk in Spirit-led obedience, God promises to
instill fear into your enemy and cause them to flee from you: “One of
your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who
fights for you, just as He promised you.” (Josh. 23:10). “The LORD shall
cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you;
they will come out against you one way and will flee before you seven
ways.” (Dt. 28:7). ‘“But you will chase your enemies and they will fall
before you by the sword; five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred
of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by
the sword.’” (Lev. 26:7-8). When you take refuge in God, He also
promises to be a shield to the evil attacks of the enemy: “Every word of
God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov.
30:5; 2 Sam. 22:31). With His help, Jonathon killed 20 Philistines (1
Sam. 14:12). His power also allowed David to kill Goliath (1 Sam.
17:50-58). He does not want you to fear any enemy (Ro. 8:15). Are you
walking in faith and obedience so that He can act on your behalf to
cause your enemies to flee?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also blessed Hezekiah by extending his life</u>. Among the
many blessings that came from Hezekiah’s faith-led obedience, God healed
him from an illness and added 15 years to his life: “Go and say to
Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, ‘I have
heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen
years to your life.”’’ (Is. 38:5). If your health is poor, turn to God
in faith for His healing.</p></li>

<u>Fear Only God: Fearing Your Enemies Can Lead to Disobedience</u>. 2
Kgs. 18:9-12.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Judah observes its powerful neighbor, Northern Israel, taken
into exile for disobedience</u>. During Hezekiah’s reign, he witnesses
the power of Assyria as it destroyed his bigger neighbor of Northern
Israel: “<sup>9 </sup><em>Now in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser
king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.
<sup>10 </sup>At the end of three years they captured it; in the sixth
year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,
Samaria was captured. <sup>11 </sup>Then the king of Assyria carried
Israel away into exile to Assyria, and put them in Halah and on the
Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
<sup>12 </sup>because they did not obey the voice of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God, but transgressed His covenant,
even all that Moses the servant of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded; they would neither listen nor
do it</em>.” (2 Kgs. 18:9-12). During the seventh year of King Hoshea’s
reign, King Shalmaneser of Assyria besieged Northern Israel. By the
ninth year of his reign, Northern Israel fell, and the Assyrians sent
part of its population into exile (2 Kgs. 17:5-6). Because Northern
Israel fell six years into Hezekiah’s reign (2 Kgs. 18:10), this was a
test of faith for him. Northern Israel was more numerous with 10 tribes.
It was also more battle tested with multiple prior conflicts with the
Syrians. If his more powerful neighbor fell, what chance did he have if
he relied upon just his own army?</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Northern Israel’s disobedience caused it to fall</u>. God
makes it clear that Northern Israel fell because of its repeated
disobedience and their refusal to listen to God when He sent prophets or
judgments (2 Kgs. 18:12). God also warned that disobedience would result
in the Jews’ exile: “But if you or your sons indeed turn away from
following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I
have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, then
I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the
house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight.
So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.” (1 Kgs.
9:6-7; Dt. 8:19-20). Moses also repeatedly warned that idolatry would
lead to the Jews’ destruction (Dt. 4:26; 8:19-20; 31:20). Joshua gave
this warning as well (Josh. 23:16). Because of Hezekiah’s obedience,
Judah had an extended existence as a nation. If Northern Israel had
shown similar obedience, the Assyrians would not have destroyed it. Yet,
this was also a warning to Judah. If it disobeyed God, it would meet the
same fate.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear is “false evidence appearing real”</u>. God does not
waste space in the Bible. The purpose of retelling the fall of Northern
Israel is to stress the fear that it would have created for the smaller
nation of Judah. Many would have drawn the wrong lesson from the demise
of Northern Israel. Some would have assumed that God had abandoned the
Jews. Others would have assumed that the Assyrians were simply too
strong to be stopped. Most would not have seen this as God’s just
punishment after He warned 20 separate kings to repent of their
idolatry. <mark>The Lord is the only thing that you are to</mark> fear
(Prov. 1:7). You fear Him when you hate evil (Prov. 8:13), something the
Jews of Northern Israel failed to do. The size of an enemy army was
never a factor in the Jews’ prior victories. Indeed, God always used a
smaller Jewish army to defeat their enemies so that He would receive the
glory. When God wanted to reduce the size of Gideon’s army, the first
thing He did was to dismiss every soldier who felt afraid (Jdgs. 7:3).
God did not want any person fighting in His army who feared the enemy.
Such a person had no trust in Him: “When you go out to battle against
your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than
you, <em>do not be afraid of them</em>; for the LORD your God, who
brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you.” (Dt. 20:1). “He
shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel, you are approaching the battle
against your enemies today. Do not be fainthearted. <em>Do not be
afraid</em>, or panic, or tremble before them, for the LORD your God is
the one who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to
save you.’” (Dt. 20:3-4). If you fear anything other than God, your
faith is lacking. Although David was the smallest man in his family, he
feared no evil or any enemy because he had faith that God was fighting
for him. “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The
Lord is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread?. . . Though a host
encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war arises against me,
in spite of this I shall be confident.” (Ps. 27:1-3). “I fear no evil,
for you are with me.” (Ps. 23:4). “How blessed in the man that fears the
Lord . . . He will not fear evil tidings” (Ps. 112:7). “Say to the
anxious heart, ‘take courage, fear not.” (Is. 34:4). <mark>Is there any
person, thing or enemy that you fear? If so, Satan may use that fear to
ensnare you and cause your faith in Jesus to falter.</mark> Without
faith, you are of no use in God’s army. It will also be “impossible” to
please Him (Heb. 11:6). Believers will also do foolish things when they
let their fears control them. This includes fleeing from an enemy: “The
fear of man brings a snare, but he who trusts in the LORD will be
exalted.” (Prov. 29:25). “I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of
those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.”
(Lk. 12:4). Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on
your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “casting all your anxiety on Him,
because He cares for you.” (1 Pet. 5:7). <mark>When you feel fear, put
your trust in Jesus.</mark></p></li>

2 Kgs. 18:13-16.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Assyria invaded Judah, and Hezekiah’s faith faltered under
pressure</u>. After witnessing Northern Israel’s destruction, God then
tested both Hezekiah and Judah with an invasion: “<sup>13 </sup><em>Now
in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria
came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
<sup>14 </sup>Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at
Lachish, saying, ‘I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you
impose on me I will bear.’ So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah
king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of
gold. <sup>15 </sup>Hezekiah gave him all the silver which was found in
the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and in the
treasuries of the king’s house. <sup>16 </sup>At that time Hezekiah cut
off the gold from the doors of the temple of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and from the doorposts which Hezekiah
king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria</em>.” (2
Kgs. 18:13-16). As a testing of their faith, God allowed King
Sennacherib of Assyria to invade in 701 B.C. This was four years after
he became king and after Hezekiah began withholding tribute from
Assyria. King Sennacherib conquered 46 of Judah’s fortified cities (2
Chron. 32:9). This is confirmed in Assyrian records. They then
threatened Jerusalem with its destruction (2 Kgs. 18:13; same, Is.
36:1). Although Hezekiah had shown the greatest faith of any king since
David, he was still human. After seeing his fortified cities fall, he
doubted God. He did not turn to God or cry out for help. Instead, he
looked for a worldly solution to his problem. He apologized to the
Assyrian king and tried to pay him off by offering him the gold that he
had restored in God’s Temple and the wealth of his treasuries. These
tributes are also recorded in inscriptions that archeologists have found
at Sennacherib’s former palace in Nineveh.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah incorrectly looked at worldly events to measure God’s
faithfulness</u>. God promised to protect the Jews when they acted in
faith-led obedience (Dt. 28:1-14). As led by the Holy Spirit, David also
promised Solomon that obedience would ensure that their descendants
continued to rule on the throne: “<sup>4 </sup>so that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> may carry out His promise which He spoke
concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful of their way, to walk
before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you
shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’” (1 Kgs. 2:4). Because
Hezekiah had acted with greater obedience than any king before him, he
had plenty of reason to trust in God’s promises. Yet, despite knowing
God’s Word, Hezekiah measured God’s faithfulness against the loss of his
48 fortified cities. Only Jerusalem remained. God, however, also stated
that the Assyrians would enter Judah and reach up to its “neck”, a
likely reference to Jerusalem: “Then it will sweep on into Judah, it
will overflow and pass through, it will reach even to the neck; and the
spread of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”
(Is. 8:10). If Hezekiah had studied these prophecies, he would have seen
the prior loss of the fortified cities as part of God’s plan. As one
commentator explains, “We can suppose that Hezekiah thought that since
the Northern Kingdom had been recently conquered and that all the
fortified cities of Judah had been captured, God had demonstrated that
He <em>would not</em> intervene on behalf of Judah. Therefore Hezekiah
felt he had to do something <em>himself</em>. . . Hezekiah hoped that
this policy of appeasement would make Judah safe. He was wrong, and his
policy only impoverished Judah and the temple and made the king of
Assyria more bold than ever against Judah.” (David Guzik on 2 Kgs.
18).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> If Hezekiah had been patient to wait
for God’s timing, he would not have given up the nation’s wealth. His
sin of impatience is a sin that nearly every believer makes.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be patient for God’s timing in times of affliction</u>. From
his many trials, David learned to patiently wait on God’s timing: “For
the choir director. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD;
and He inclined to me and heard my cry.” (Ps. 40:1). “Wait for the LORD;
be strong and let your heart take courage; yes, wait for the LORD.” (Ps.
27:14; 25:3, 21). Even in the face of trials, Paul also encourages
believers that your faith should include “rejoicing in hope, persevering
in tribulation, devoted to prayer,” (Ro. 12:12). Are you willing to wait
patiently for God to act in His timing?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in God’s timing, even when all appears lost</u>.
Hezekiah’s actions would have appeared reasonable after watching every
other city in Judah fall to the Assyrians. But God wants you to place
your trust in His timing, even when it might appear foolish to do so.
“For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Cor. 1:18;
2:14). Even a wise and godly leader cannot lean upon his or her own
understanding in times of peril: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart
and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). Do you
regularly seek out God’s guidance in prayer when you are unsure about
His will?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be encouraged and strengthened by the Spirit</u>. God knows
when your faith is weak. When you let His Spirit lead you, He will
encourage and strengthen you: “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the
strength of His might.” (Eph. 6:10). “On the day I called, You answered
me; You made me bold with strength in my soul.” (Ps. 138:3). “He said,
‘O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage
and be courageous!’ Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength
and said, ‘May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”’ (Dan.
10:19). “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons
of God.” (Ro. 8:14). If you are feeling weak or depressed, are you
praying in faith for Him to strengthen and encourage you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Satan will use anything you give him to harm you</u>. To
understand the folly of giving God’s treasures to appease his enemies,
Hezekiah only needed to look to the misfortune of his father Ahaz, who
made a similar mistake: “So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came
against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him. Although
Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the LORD and out of the palace
of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria, it
did not help him.” (2 Chr. 28:20-21; 2 Kgs. 16:8). Hezekiah’s act of
appeasement only prompted his enemy to try to seize all of
Judah.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Assyrians taunt Judah for thinking their former captures
in Egypt will rescue them</u>. Hezekiah’s appeasement only emboldened
the Assyrians. Thus, the Assyrians demanded their complete surrender and
boasted that no kingdom on Earth could save them:
“<sup>17 </sup><em>Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris
and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a large army to
Jerusalem. So they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they went up,
they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is on the
highway of the fuller’s field. <sup>18 </sup>When they called to the
king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and
Shebnah the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to
them. <sup>19 </sup>Then Rabshakeh said to them, ‘Say now to Hezekiah,
‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, ‘What is this confidence
that you have? <sup>20 </sup>You say (but they are only empty words), ‘I
have counsel and strength for the war.’ Now on whom do you rely, that
you have rebelled against me? <sup>21 </sup>Now behold, you rely on the
staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it
will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all
who rely on him</em>.” (2 Kgs. 18:17-21). The Assyrians were apparently
surprised that Hezekiah was able to pay the large amount of gold and
silver that they demanded. They assumed incorrectly that Hezekiah must
have had even more gold and silver hidden in the Temple or in Jerusalem.
The Assyrians then surrounded Jerusalem, and Hezekiah prepared the city
for a siege (in 2 Chron. 32:3-8). King Sennacherib was so confident in
his victory that he went home and sent his servants to give Hezekiah his
ultimatum. King Sennacherib’s servants are referred to by their titles
and not their proper names. The name “Tartan” was the title for the
Assyrian commanding general (Isa. 20:1). The name “Rab-saris” translated
as chief eunuch. This likely was the title for a senior military
officer. The title “Rab-shakeh” translated as commander. He was King
Sennacherib’s spokesperson and a high official in his government (See
also, Isa. 36-37). They taunted Judah that no power on Earth could save
them. Although the Jews wanted to turn to Egypt, Egypt could not help
them. The Assyrians were using psychological warfare to bring down the
Jews’ morale.</p></li>

<li><p><u>The Assyrians’ threats at the conduit of the upper pool</u>.
The Assyrians left from their base at the captured city of Lachish to
threaten Hezekiah at the “conduit upper pool” on the road between
Jerusalem and Samaria (2 Kgs. 18:17). God orchestrated this meeting spot
to draw a message. The Assyrians were showing that they could stop
Jerusalem’s water source and bring the people to its knees. Yet, at this
exact same spot, the prophet Isaiah warned the wayward King of Judah
Ahaz not to trust in foreign powers. Ahaz, however, was evil and would
not listen to God’s Word (Is. 7:3). Hezekiah sent three men to meet with
the Assyrians. These included Eliakim, his palace administrator, Shebna,
his scribe and Asaph, a recorder or intermediary between the king and
the people (2 Kgs. 18:18; 2 Sam. 8:16). Isaiah later recorded this same
encounter verbatim, which suggests that he was either present or
intimately involved: “Then Rabshakeh said to them, ‘Say now to Hezekiah,
‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, ‘What is this confidence
that you have? I say, ‘Your counsel and strength for the war are only
empty words.’ Now on whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against
me? Behold, you rely on the staff of this crushed reed, <em>even</em> on
Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it.
So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.”’’ (Is. 36:4-6) In
both accounts, the Assyrians belittled Hezekiah by refusing to call him
a king. This was calculated to scare the Jews into thinking that he
would not be king for long. Ironically, Isaiah had given the Jews the
same advice. Their former captors in Egypt could not save them (Isa.
19:11-17; 20:1-6; 30:1-7; 31:1-3). Yet, many placed their hope in
Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not put your faith in worldly things for your protection
and deliverance</u>. In the Bible, Egypt frequently symbolized the
world. Isaiah condemned those who sought worldly protection through the
Jews’ former oppressors in Egypt: “Then they will be dismayed and
ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast.” (Is. 20:5).
“Who proceed down to Egypt Without consulting Me, to take refuge in the
safety of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt! Therefore
the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame and the shelter in the shadow
of Egypt, your humiliation.” (Is. 30:2-3). “Woe to those who go down to
Egypt for help and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they
are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they do not
look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD!” (Is. 31:1). God also
does not want you to place your trust in worldly solutions for your
problems.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Assyrians taunt Judah for listening to Hezekiah and
smashing their pagan altars</u>. The Assyrians then sought to create
fear by causing the Jews to question Hezekiah’s acts of obedience in
smashing their pagan altars. They also tried to manipulate God’s
prophecies by claiming that their conquest was part of God’s will:
“<sup>22 </sup><em>But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God,’ is it not He whose high places
and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to
Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?
<sup>23 </sup>Now therefore, come, make a bargain with my master the
king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are
able on your part to set riders on them. <sup>24 </sup>How then can you
repulse one official of the least of my master’s servants, and rely on
Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <sup>25 </sup>Have I now come up
without the <span class="smallcaps">Lord’s</span> approval against this
place to destroy it? The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to me,
‘Go up against this land and destroy it</em>.’” (2 Kgs. 18:22-25).
Acting under Satan’s influence, Rab-shakeh tried to convince the Jews
that they had eroded their opportunities to worship Yahweh by destroying
the pagan altars and centralizing all worship in the Temple (2 Kgs.
18:3-4, 22; 2 Chron. 31:1). To taunt the Jews, he offered that the
Assyrians could give them 2,000 horses if the Jews could find enough
able bodied men to ride them (2 Kgs. 18:23). Isaiah also records this
insult (Is. 36:8-9). From the Assyrians’ taunts, we can infer that the
Jews did not have 2,000 fighting men left in Jerusalem. Rab-shakeh then
sought to manipulate Isaiah’s prophecies by alleging that Yahweh had
sent the Assyrians to destroy the Jews (2 Kgs. 18:24). His taunt is also
recorded in Isaiah 36:10. He wanted to demoralize the Jews and have them
give up without a fight. That is what Satan wants to do to you as well.
He wants you to give into him without a fight.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Assyrians manipulated God’s prophecies of judgment against
Northern Israel</u>. Through their spies, the Assyrians knew of Isaiah’s
prophecies that God would use them to judge Northern Israel: “The LORD
will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house such days
as have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah, the
king of Assyria . . . In that day the Lord will shave with a razor,
hired from regions beyond the Euphrates (that is, with the king of
Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the
beard.” (Is. 7:17, 20). “Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to
bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates, even the
king of Assyria and all his glory; and it will rise up over all its
channels and go over all its banks.” (Is. 8:7). But these prophecies
were not directed against Judah. Moreover, Isaiah also warned that
Assyria would also regret its actions, even though God would use it as
the rod of His judgment against the apostate state of Northern Israel:
“<em>Woe to Assyria</em>, the rod of My anger and the staff in whose
hands is My indignation,” (Is. 10:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Satan uses deceit and lies to manipulate God’s Word</u>. Lies
and deceit are Satan’s tools to turn people away from God (Dt. 11:16;
30:17). <em>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father</em>. . . Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks
from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Jo.
8:44). Unless you know God’s Word, Satan will try to twist it or
manipulate it to cause you to disobey God.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Assyrians taunt Judah over Hezekiah’s promise that God
would deliver them</u>. Finally, the Assyrians tried to cause the Jews
to question God and their belief that they could turn to Him for
deliverance: “<sup>26 </sup><em>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and
Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, ‘Speak now to your servants in
Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the
hearing of the people who are on the wall.’ <sup>27 </sup>But Rabshakeh
said to them, ‘Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to
speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat
their own dung and drink their own urine with you?’ <sup>28 </sup>Then
Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean, saying, ‘Hear the
word of the great king, the king of Assyria. <sup>29 </sup>Thus says the
king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to
deliver you from my hand; <sup>30 </sup>nor let Hezekiah make you trust
in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will surely deliver us, and this city will
not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ <sup>31 </sup>Do not
listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace
with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig
tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,
<sup>32 </sup>until I come and take you away to a land like your own
land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a
land of olive trees and honey, that you may live and not die.’ But do
not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver us.’ <sup>33 </sup>Has any
one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the
king of Assyria? <sup>34 </sup>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?
Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered
Samaria from my hand? <sup>35 </sup>Who among all the gods of the lands
have delivered their land from my hand, that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’
<sup>36 </sup>But the people were silent and answered him not a word,
for the king’s commandment was, ‘Do not answer him.’ <sup>37 </sup>Then
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the
scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with
their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh</em>.” (2 Kgs.
18:26-37). After Rab-shakeh’s efforts to scare Hezekiah’s servants into
submission failed, he then spoke in Hebrew in an effort to cause the
Jews to revolt against Hezekiah. Hezekiah’s servants then tried without
success to have him speak in Aramaic (2 Kgs. 18:26; same, Is. 36:11).
Rab-shakeh first tried to scare the people by stating that Hezekiah was
deceiving them (2 Kgs. 18:29). He then tried to cause them to doubt God
and believe in the enemy’s lies.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The enemy tries to deceive you to doubt God’s promises to
deliver you</u>. Rab-shakeh falsely told the Jews that they could not
trust God to deliver them: “<em><sup> </sup>nor let Hezekiah make you
trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will surely deliver us</em>’ . . . <em>But
do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver us.</em>”’ (2 Kgs. 18:30-32).
Both Isaiah and 2 Chronicles also record Rab-shakeh’s blasphemous and
arrogant claims against Yahweh (Is. 36:18; 2 Chr. 32:15). Rab-shakeh
then pointed out that none of the other pagan gods had been able to stop
the Assyrians (2 Kgs. 18:34). If the pagan gods could not stop the
Assyrians, Rab-shakeh arrogantly proclaimed that Yahweh could not stop
them either: “<em>Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered
their land from my hand, that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?</em>”’ (2 Kgs. 18:35). Yet, God
is not a powerless pagan idol. To demonstrate His power, to show His
faithfulness, and to humble the Assyrians, God had Isaiah give a
prophecy that He would save Jerusalem: “Like flying birds so the LORD of
hosts will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; He will
pass over and rescue it.” (Is. 31:5). “For I will defend this city to
save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’” (Is. 37:35).
“I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria;
and I will defend this city.” (Is. 38:6). And He would soon fulfill His
promises. He would destroy the entire Assyrian army through a miracle.
(2 Kgs. 19:34; 2 Chr. 32:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Depend upon Jesus as your only savior</u>. Throughout the
Jews’ history, God had repeatedly delivered them. He was their only
deliverer: “I, even I, am the LORD, and there is no savior besides Me.”
(Is. 43:11). “Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer,
the LORD of hosts: ‘I am the first and I am the last, And there is no
God besides Me.”’ (Is. 44:6). “Do not tremble and do not be afraid; have
I not long since announced it to you and declared it? And you are My
witnesses. Is there any God besides Me, or is there any other Rock? I
know of none.” (Is. 44:8). “Yet I have been the LORD your God since the
land of Egypt; and you were not to know any god except Me, for there is
no savior besides Me.” (Hos. 13:4). Jesus is also your only savior (1
Jo. 4:14; Lk. 2:11; Jo. 3:16). He also wants you to depend upon Him
alone to deliver you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not put your trust in human leaders</u>. Rab-shakeh said
that the Jews should not put their trust in Hezekiah. He was correct
with this statement. Only in God could they place their trust: “Do not
trust in princes, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps.
146:3). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in
princes.” (Ps. 118:9). “O give us help against the adversary, for
deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Have you placed your trust
in political leaders or in God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The enemy makes false promises of peace when you give into
him</u>. Rab-shakeh also made the false promise of peace and prosperity
to the Jews if they surrendered without a fight to King Sennacherib and
the Assyrians: “<em>thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with
me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree
and drink each of the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take
you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a
land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey, that you
may live and not die.</em>’” (2 Kgs. 18:31-32). Isaiah also records
Rab-shakeh’s false promise (Is. 36:17). Rab-shakeh did not mention that
the Jews would become slaves. He made this false promise even though the
Assyrians led away the Jews of Northern Israel naked and with fishhooks
in the mouths. “The Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> has sworn by
His holiness, ‘Behold, the days are coming upon you when they will take
you away with meat hooks, and the last of you with fish hooks.
<sup>3 </sup>You will go out through breaches in the walls, each one
straight before her, and you will be cast to Harmon,’ declares the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Amos 4:2-3). Thus, the Assyrians
offered only pain.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Satan can only offer fleeting counterfeit pleasures</u>. The
pleasure Satan offers to the person who gives into covetousness never
lasts long (Heb. 11:25; Lk. 12:19-20). Giving into Satan’s temptations
will never satisfy your desires. You will only want more of the same
empty temptation: “Furthermore, wine betrays the haughty man, so that he
does not stay at home. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, and he is
like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all nations and
collects to himself all peoples.” (Hab. 2:5). “And the dogs are greedy,
they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no
understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each one to his
unjust gain, to the last one.” (Is. 56:11). “Sheol, and the barren womb,
Earth that is never satisfied with water, and fire that never says,
‘Enough’”. (Prov. 30:16). Don’t give into temptation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not try to reason with Satan</u>. The Jews had the faith
not to panic when they heard Rab-shakeh’s threats, his lies, his
manipulation, and his blaspheme against Yahweh. Instead, they followed
Hezekiah’s Spirit-led command for them not to respond back (2 Kgs.
18:36; same Is. 36:21). Hezekiah’s servants later tore their clothes not
out of fear. Instead, they tore their clothes in grief because of the
blaspheme against Yahweh (2 Kgs. 18:37; same, Is. 36:22). God would soon
reward the Jews for their faith. Believers also should not try to reason
with Satan. When you feel tempted by evil, you are commanded to flee
from your temptation (1 Cor. 6:18). Trying to reason with temptation
frequently results in your submission to your temptation. Instead,
rebuke Satan (Jude 1:9) and give your burdens to God. He alone is your
deliverer when you turn to Him in faith.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God when you need deliverance</u>. When you are in
need of deliverance, cry out to God. “O LORD, how my adversaries have
increased! Many are rising up against me. Many are saying of my soul,
‘There is no deliverance for him in God.’ Selah. But You, O LORD, are a
shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. I was crying
to the LORD with my voice, and He answered me from His holy mountain.
Selah. I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me. I will
not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against
me round about.” (Ps. 3:1-6; 25:2).</p></li>
