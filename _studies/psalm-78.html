<h1 id="psalm-78-lessons-for-avoiding-israels-seven-deadly-sins">Psalm 78: Lessons For Avoiding Israel’s Seven Deadly Sins</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 78 is the second longest psalm, surpassed only by Psalm 119. Psalms 78, 105 and 106 are also the three great historical psalms. Here, Asaph recounted the history of Israel to warn of its seven deadly sins that brought God’s wrath. These included: (1) rebellion, (2) forgetfulness, (3) faithlessness, (4) covetousness, (5) lies, (6) ungratefulness, and (7) idolatry.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Asaph condemned the Jews for their constant rebellions against God. Believers are also warned to never rebel against God or His Word. <u>Second</u>, the Jews rebelled because they forgot about God’s miracles and took Him for granted. Believers are also warned to never forget God’s ongoing mercy and grace or take Him for granted. <u>Third</u>, the Jews also sinned because they doubted God and lacked faith in His many promises. Believers are also warned to never doubt God’s promises. <u>Fourth</u>, the Jews further sinned because they were not content with God’s provision and constantly coveted more. Believers are also warned to be content with God’s grace and to never give into the sin of covetousness. <u>Fifth</u>, the Jews sought to conceal their sins with false vows that they had no intention of keeping. Believers are also warned to never embrace lies or deceit with God or anyone else. <u>Sixth</u>, the Jews also sinned because they lacked gratitude for God’s many miraculous miracles. Believers are also warned to never be ungrateful to God. <u>Finally</u>, the Jews provoked God to anger because they embraced idols instead of trusting Him. Believers are also warned that they should never embrace the idols of the world over God.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph warned the Jews not to repeat Israel’s rebellions</u>. Using parables, Asaph urged the Jews to teach their children to avoid repeating Israel’s rebellions against God: “<em>A Maskil of Asaph. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Listen, my people, to my instruction; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will tell riddles of old, <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We will not conceal them from their children, but we will tell the generation to come the praises of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and His power and His wondrous works that He has done. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers that they were to teach them to their children, <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>so that the generation to come would know, the children yet to be born, that they would arise and tell them to their children, <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>so that they would put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God, but comply with His commandments, <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>and not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God</em>.” (Ps. 78:1-8). Rebellion is so evil that God compares it to witchcraft: “For rebellion is as reprehensible as the sin of divination, and insubordination is as reprehensible as false religion and idolatry. Since you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.” (1 Sam. 15:23). Thus, you should always obey God and never rebel against Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pay attention to and obey God’s Word</u>. Asaph urged God’s people to pay attention to his prophetic word: “<em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Listen, my people, to my instruction; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</em>” (Ps. 78:1). Many of the psalms begin with similar exhortations for God’s people to listen carefully: “A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all peoples; listen, all inhabitants of the world,” (Ps. 49:1). “A Maskil of Asaph. Listen, my people, to my instruction; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.” (Ps. 78:1). Isaiah also frequently began his revelations with similar exhortations: “Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation; for a law will go out from Me, and I will bring My justice as a light of the peoples.” (Is. 51:4). “Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, according to the faithful mercies shown to David.” (Is. 55:3). God also deserves your full attention.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God spoke in parables because people are spiritually blinded and hear without listening</u>. Asaph then declared that he would deliver his message as a parable: “<em>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will tell riddles of old,”</em> (Ps. 78:2). David also spoke in parables: “I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will express my riddle on the harp.” (Ps. 49:4). Jesus also spoke in parables: “All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak anything to them without a parable. This was so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled: ‘I will open My mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.”’ (Matt. 13:34-35). Sin will blind you to God’s truth. Thus, God may resort to parables to gain your attention.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Teach the Word to your children and others</u>.  Asaph urged the Jews to teach their children the lessons from God’s Word and the Jews’ history: “<em><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We will not conceal them from their children, but we will tell the generation to come the praises of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and His power and His wondrous works that He has done.</em>” (Ps. 78:4). As part of the Mosaic law, God’s people were obligated to teach His Word and His Law to His people:  “These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart.  You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.”  (Dt. 6:6-7).  “[B]ut make them known to your sons and your grandsons.”  (Dt. 4:9-10).  “But as for you, stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which <em>you shall teach them</em>, that they may observe them in the land which I give them to possess.’” (Dt. 5:31;11:19).  This commandment is also repeated throughout the Bible: “Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he is old he will not depart from it.” (Prov. 22:6; Ps. 78:4-6).  It is also repeated again in the New Testament: “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.”  (Eph. 6:4).  “For though by this time <em>you ought to be teachers,</em> you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.”  (Heb. 5:12).  Do you look for teaching opportunities throughout the day to teach your children or others God’s Word?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s people repeatedly rebelled against Him</u>. Asaph warned that God’s people had repeatedly rebelled through history: “<em><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>and not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God</em>.” (Ps. 78:8). God called His people obstinate: “Then the LORD said to Moses, ‘I have seen this people, and behold, they are an obstinate people.”’ (Ex.32:9). Moses then repeatedly called God’s people rebellious: “Remember, do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD. . . You have been rebellious toward the LORD since the day I knew you.” (Dt. 9:7, 24). “For I know your rebellion and your stubbornness; behold, as long as I have been alive with you until today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death?” (Dt. 31:27). Despite God’s mercy and grace, His people repeatedly drifted into rebellion against God: “But it came about, when the judge died, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them; they did not abandon their practices or their obstinate ways.” (Jdg. 2:19; 2 Kgs. 17:14; 2 Chr. 30:7). The sin of rebellion was just as abhorrent to God back then as it is today. Thus, obey God out of your love for Him.</p></li>

<h2 id="forgetfulness-never-forget-gods-ongoing-mercy-and-grace.-ps.-789-17.">2. <u>Forgetfulness: Never Forget God’s Ongoing Mercy and Grace</u>. Ps. 78:9-17.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph warned the Jews that their forgetfulness would lead to rebellion</u>. Despite His incredible miracles through history, Asaph lamented that Israel had forgotten about its one true God and deliverer: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows, yet they turned back on the day of battle. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to walk in His Law; <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>they forgot His deeds and His miracles that He had shown them. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He performed wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, and He made the waters stand up like a heap. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Then He led them with the cloud by day and all the night with a light of fire. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them plenty to drink like the ocean depths. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>He brought forth streams from the rock and made waters run down like rivers. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Yet they still continued to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert</em>.” (Ps. 78:9-17). The “children of Ephraim” referred to the nation of Israel (2 Chr. 25:7). “The children of Ephraim (comp. ver. 67). Ephraim was the leading tribe, from the appointment of Joshua to succeed Moses until the establishment of Saul as king. Hence the tabernacle was set up within the territory of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>). The importance of Ephraim appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-9.htm">Judges 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1-6</a>. Being armed, and carrying bows. There is no ‘and’ in the original. ‘Carrying bows’ is exegetical of ‘being armed’ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm">2 Chronicles 17:17</a>). Turned back in the day of battle. The allusion is not to any one particular occasion, but to the ill success of Israel under the leadership of Ephraim during the whole period of the Judges (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8, 13, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7, 12</a>, etc.).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 78).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> A nation is bound to rebel when it forgets about God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s miracles were hard to forget</u>. Throughout history, God had performed incredible miracles. For example, He unleashed the ten mighty plagues against Pharaoh: “<em><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He performed wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan</em>.” (Ps. 78:12; Ex. 7-12). He then divided the Red Sea, and He allowed the Jews to safely cross over it: “<em><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, and He made the waters stand up like a heap.</em>” (Ps. 78:13). This miracle was so incredible that it is celebrated throughout the Bible (E.g., Ex. 14:21-22; 15:8; Nu. 33:8; Ps. 66:6; 106:9, 22; 136:13; Acts 7:36; 1 Cor. 10:1; Heb. 11:29). Even the pagan nations had heard of this miracle (Josh. 2:10). God then guided the Jews with a miraculous pillar of light through the desert: “<em><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Then He led them with the cloud by day and all the night with a light of fire.</em>” (Ps. 78:14; Ex. 13:21; 14:24; 40:38; Dt. 1:33). He then split the rocks and allowed for His people to have fresh water: “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them plenty to drink like the ocean depths. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>He brought forth streams from the rock and made waters run down like rivers.</em> ” (Ps. 78:15-16; Ex. 17:6; Nu. 20:8-11; Dt. 8:15; Is. 48:21; 1 Cor. 10:4). Yet, despite these miracles, the Jews continued to rebel (Ps. 78:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t forget God’s miracles in delivering both you and others</u>. Asaph lamented that the Jews had forgotten about God despite His many incredible miracles: “<em><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>they forgot His deeds and His miracles that He had shown them</em>” (Ps. 78:11). Moses warned that pride can cause you to forget God’s miracles: “then <em>your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD</em> your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;” (Dt. 8:14). Thus, Moses warned God’s people to take steps so that they would not forget God’s miraculous acts of deliverance: “Be careful that you <em>do not forget the LORD</em> your God by failing to keep His commandments, His ordinances, and His statutes which I am commanding you today;” (Dt. 8:11). But, despite these warnings, the Jews repeatedly forgot about God’s miracles in delivering them: “Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; <em>they did not remember</em> Your abundant kindnesses, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea. . . <em>They quickly forgot His works</em>; they did not wait for His plan, . . . <em>They forgot God their Savior</em>, who had done great things in Egypt,” (Ps. 106:7, 13, 21). “Can a virgin forget her jewelry, or a bride her attire? Yet <em>My people have forgotten Me</em> for days without number.” (Jer. 2:32). “For <em>you have forgotten the God of your salvation</em> and have <em>not remembered the rock of your refuge</em>.” (Is. 17:10a).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Forgetting about God will cause you to turn away from Him</u>. Because the Jews forgot about God, they turned away from Him: “<em><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to walk in His Law;</em>” (Ps. 78:10). This repeatedly happened after God gave the Jews the Promised Land: “So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, ‘Because this nation has violated My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice,”’ (Jdgs. 2:20). Even the wisest man alive became prideful, forgot about his need for God and then rebelled: “So the LORD said to Solomon, ‘Since you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will certainly tear the kingdom away from you, and will give it to your servant.”’ (1 Kgs. 11:11; 2 Kgs. 18:12). This warning applies to all believers: “Those who forget God’s works are sure to fail in their own.” (Charles Spurgeon on Psalm 78).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faithlessness-never-doubt-gods-many-promises-to-you.-ps.-7818-22.">3. <u>Faithlessness: Never Doubt God’s Many Promises to You</u>. Ps. 78:18-22.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph warned the Jews that their lack of faith caused them to doubt God’s promises</u>. Despite God’s many miracles, the Jews doubted God and failed to trust Him to provide: “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>And in their heart they put God to the test by asking for food that suited their taste. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then they spoke against God; they said, ‘Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, and streams were overflowing; can He also provide bread? Will He prepare meat for His people?’ <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Therefore the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> heard and was full of wrath; and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also mounted against Israel, <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>because they did not believe in God and did not trust in His salvation</em>.” (Ps. 78:18-22). Doubt comes from a lack of faith. When you serve with doubt, your works are highly unlikely to be pleasing to God: “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews tested God</u>. The Jews tested God by doubting Him: “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>And in their heart they put God to the test by asking for food that suited their taste.</em>” (Ps. 78:18). “So the people quarreled with Moses and said, ‘Give us water so that we may drink!’ And Moses said to them, ‘Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?”’ (Ex. 17:2). “You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah.” (Dt. 6:16). “Jesus said to him, ‘On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the LORD your God to the test.’”’ (Matt. 4:7; Lk. 4:12). When you doubt God, you also test Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews repeatedly doubted God</u>. Despite God’s many miracles, the Jews continued to doubt Him: “<em><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Then they spoke against God; they said, ‘Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, and streams were overflowing; can He also provide bread? Will He prepare meat for His people?</em>”’ (Ps. 78:19-20). “The sons of Israel said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’S hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread until we were full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this entire assembly with hunger!” (Ex. 16:3). “Now the rabble who were among them had greedy cravings; and the sons of Israel also wept again and said, ‘Who will give us meat to eat?”’ (Nu. 11:4). “And all the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the entire congregation said to them, ‘If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or even if we had died in this wilderness! So why is the LORD bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder! Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”’ (Nu. 14:2-3). “Then the people argued with Moses and spoke, saying, ‘If only we had perished when our brothers perished before the LORD!”’ (Nu. 20:3; 21:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews lacked faith</u>. The Jews doubted God’s promises because they lacked faith: “<em><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>because they did not believe in God and did not trust in His salvation</em>.” (Ps. 78:22). “And the LORD said to Moses, ‘How long will this people be disrespectful to Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs that I have performed in their midst?”’ (Nu. 14:11). “Yet in spite of all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,” (Dt. 1:32). “And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God; you neither trusted Him nor listened to His voice.” (Dt. 9:23). “Then they rejected the pleasant land; they did not believe His word,” (Ps. 106:24). God wants you to learn from the Jews’ mistakes. Never doubt God’s many promises to you.</p></li>

<h2 id="covetousness-never-give-into-the-sin-of-covetousness.-ps.-7823-35.">4. <u>Covetousness: Never Give Into the Sin of Covetousness</u>. Ps. 78:23-35.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews were not satisfied with God’s provision</u>. Despite God’s provision, the Jews were unsatisfied and coveted more: “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Yet He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven; <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>He rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them food from heaven. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>He made the east wind blow in the sky and by His power He directed the south wind. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>When He rained meat upon them like the dust, even winged fowl like the sand of the seas, <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>He let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>So they ate and were well filled, and He satisfied their longing. <strong><sup>30</sup></strong> Yet before they had abandoned their longing, while their food was in their mouths,<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>the anger of God rose against them and killed some of their strongest ones, and subdued the choice men of Israel. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>In spite of all this they still sinned and did not believe in His wonderful works. <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>So He brought their days to an end in futility, and their years to an end in sudden terror. <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>When He killed them, then they sought Him, and they returned and searched diligently for God; <strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>and they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their Redeemer</em>.” (Ps. 78:23-35). God also wants you to avoid coveting (Philip. 4:11-13; 1 Tim. 6:7-8). If you delight in Him, He will fulfill your desires: “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God miraculously provided manna for the Jews’ needs</u>. God caused manna to rain down from heaven to provide for the Jews’ needs: “<em><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>He rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them food from heaven.</em>” (Ps. 78:24). “They asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.” (Ps. 105:40; Ex. 16:4, 15; Dt. 8:16). The manna symbolized Jesus, the bread of life: “Jesus then said to them, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.” (John 6:32-33). “and they all ate the same spiritual food,” (1 Cor. 10:3). Be satisfied with the manna that Jesus offers you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also miraculously provided quail when the Jews complained</u>. When the Jews were unsatisfied with manna, God sent quail to the Jews with a strong wind: “<em><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>He made the east wind blow in the sky and by His power He directed the south wind. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>When He rained meat upon them like the dust, even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,</em>” (Ps. 78:26-27). “But the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. The sons of Israel said to them, ‘If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread until we were full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this entire assembly with hunger!”’ (Ex. 16:2-3, 13). “But the people were thirsty for water there; and they grumbled against Moses and said, ‘Why is it that you have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”’ (Ex. 17:3). “Now a wind burst forth from the LORD and it brought quail from the sea, and dropped them beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side all around the camp, and about two cubits deep on the surface of the ground.” (Nu. 11:31). The Jews complained because they coveted the things of the flesh.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s anger burned because the Jews coveted and became greedy</u>. God’s anger burned at the Jews because coveted more what God had not given them, and they were ungrateful for His provision: “<em><strong><sup>30</sup></strong> Yet before they had abandoned their longing, while their food was in their mouths,<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>the anger of God rose against them and killed some of their strongest ones, and subdued the choice men of Israel.</em>” (Ps. 78:30-31). The Jews coveted and gorged themselves without thanking God: “but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nose and makes you nauseated; because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?”’ (Nu. 11:20). This caused God’s anger to burn: “While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very severe plague. So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had been greedy.” (Nu. 11:33-4). “So He gave them their request, but sent a wasting disease among them.” (Ps. 106:15). “Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer.” (1 Cor. 10:10). They remembered God only when disciplined. He then showed them mercy (Ps. 78:33-35). The sin of coveting can also lead to more serious sins in your life as well.</p></li>

<h2 id="lies-deceit-never-embrace-lies-or-deceit.-ps.-7836-39.">5. <u>Lies /Deceit: Never Embrace Lies or Deceit</u>. Ps. 78:36-39.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God responded to the Jews’ lies and deceit by showing them mercy and grace</u>. Asaph reminded the Jews of how God withheld the punishment that they deserved when they lied to God or sought to deceive Him with their false promises of obedience: “<strong><sup>36 </sup></strong><em>But they flattered Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue. <strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, nor were they faithful with His covenant. <strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>But He, being compassionate, forgave their wrongdoing and did not destroy them; and often He restrained His anger and did not stir up all His wrath. <strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>So He remembered that they were only flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.</em>” (Ps. 78:36-39). You should always be honest with God and avoid making vows that you will break (Matt 5:36-37).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews tried to deceive God</u>. The Jews repeatedly made vows to obey God (Ex. 19:8; 24:3, 7; Josh. 24:24). But their hearts were evil. Thus, they had no intention of changing their evil ways: “<strong><sup>36 </sup></strong><em>But they flattered Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue</em>. <em><strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, nor were they faithful with His covenant.</em>” (Ps. 78:36-37). “Of whom were you worried and fearful when you lied, and did not remember Me Nor give Me a thought? Was I not silent, even for a long time, so you do not fear Me?” (Is. 57:11). “Then the Lord said, ‘Because this people approaches Me with their words and honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me, and their reverence for Me consists of the commandment of men that is taught;”’ (Is. 29:13; Mk. 7:6). “And they come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not do them; for they do the lustful desires expressed by their mouth, and their heart follows their unlawful gain.” (Ezek. 33:31). God knows the desires of your heart. Like the Jews, you cannot hide sin from Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s compassion and mercy and grace was greater than the Jews’ sins</u>. In the face of their constant rebellions, God showed the Jews compassion and mercy: “<em><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>But He, being compassionate, forgave their wrongdoing and did not destroy them; and often He restrained His anger and did not stir up all His wrath.</em>” (Ps. 78:36). “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or in dread of them, for the LORD your God is the One who is going with you. He will not desert you or abandon you.” (Dt. 31:6). The Jews used God’s mercy as a license to sin more. Don’t make the same mistake (Ro. 6:1).</p></li>

<h2 id="ungratefulness-never-forget-to-show-god-gratitude.-ps.-7840-57.">6. <u>Ungratefulness: Never Forget to Show God Gratitude</u>. Ps. 78:40-57.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews showed no appreciation to God for His miraculous delivery of His people</u>. Despite freeing the Jews from Egyptian bondage and bringing them to the Promised Land, the Jews remained ungrateful. This in turn contributed to their ongoing rebellions: “<em><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness and grieved Him in the desert! <strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>Again and again they tempted God, and pained the Holy One of Israel</em>. <strong><sup>42 </sup></strong><em>They did not remember His power, the day when He redeemed them from the enemy, <strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>when He performed His signs in Egypt and His marvels in the field of Zoan, <strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>and turned their rivers to blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink. <strong><sup>45 </sup></strong>He sent swarms of flies among them that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them. <strong><sup>46 </sup></strong>He also gave their crops to the grasshopper and the product of their labor to the locust. <strong><sup>47 </sup></strong>He destroyed their vines with hailstones and their sycamore trees with frost. <strong><sup>48 </sup></strong>He also turned their cattle over to the hailstones, and their herds to bolts of lightning. <strong><sup>49 </sup></strong>He sent His burning anger upon them, fury and indignation and trouble, a band of destroying angels. <strong><sup>50 </sup></strong>He leveled a path for His anger; He did not spare their souls from death, but turned their lives over to the plague, <strong><sup>51 </sup></strong>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first and best of their vigor in the tents of Ham. <strong><sup>52 </sup></strong>But He led His own people out like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock; <strong><sup>53 </sup></strong>He led them safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea engulfed their enemies. <strong><sup>54 </sup></strong>So He brought them to His holy land, to this hill country which His right hand had gained. <strong><sup>55 </sup></strong>He also drove out the nations from them and apportioned them as an inheritance by measurement, and had the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. <strong><sup>56 </sup></strong>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep His testimonies, <strong><sup>57 </sup></strong>but turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; they turned aside like a treacherous bow</em>.” (Ps. 78:40-57). “Keep in mind that the sins Asaph had in mind were the sins of ingratitude, testing God, and doubting His power and His care. These were sins God was <strong>furious</strong> with. We often think God takes little account of such sins.” (David Guzik on Ps. 78).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> God also wants you to be grateful for your deliverance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s mighty hand delivered the Jews from Egyptian captivity</u>. Asaph celebrated God’s many signs and wonders that He performed in Egypt to free His people from bondage: “<em><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>when He performed His signs in Egypt and His marvels in the field of Zoan,</em>” (Ps. 78:43). God promised to show His signs and wonders so that all would remember His power to deliver: “So I will reach out with My hand and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go.” (Ex. 3:20). “But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 7:3). David’s song of thanksgiving urged the Jews to never forget God’s signs and wonders: “Remember His wonderful deeds which He has done, His marvels and the judgments from His mouth,” (1 Chr. 16:12). But they forgot about Him. The Jews took God’s deliverance for granted and demanded more from Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s ten plagues were a sign of His might and power to deliver</u>. As examples of God’s power, Asaph recounted seven of the 10 plagues, listing some out of order and omitting the plagues of lice / gnats (plague number 3), boils (number 6), and darkness (number 9)). God first turned the Nile water into blood (plague number 1) (Ps. 78:44; Ex. 7:20). He then unleashed plagues of frogs and flies (numbers 2 and 4) (Ps. 78:45; 105:29-31; Ex. 8:6, 24). He sent a plague to destroy the Egyptian’s livestock (number 5) (Ps. 78:48; Ex. 9:6). He sent a plague of hail (number 7) (Ps. 78:47; Ex. 9:23-25). He then set a plague of locusts to destroy Egypt’s crops (number 8) (Ps. 78:46; 105:34; Ex. 10:13-14). Finally, He sent a plague that killed every firstborn child who did not have the blood of a lamb over the doorposts of their homes (number 10). (Ps. 78:49-51; Ex. 12:29-30). God’s mighty acts of judgment against the Egyptians also showed His power to deliver: “Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the labors of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.”’ (Ex. 6:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s guidance of His people was another sign of His power to deliver</u>. After freeing the Jews, He then used His power to guide His people: “<em><strong><sup>52 </sup></strong>But He led His own people out like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</em>” (Ps. 78:52). “You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.” (Ps. 77:20). “In Your faithfulness You have led the people whom You have redeemed; in Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.” (Ex. 15:13). In addition to appointing leaders over His flock, God also miraculously guided His people with a pillar of light (Ex. 13:21; 14:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s destruction of Pharaoh’s army was another sign of His deliverance</u>. God again showed His mighty hand when He crushed Pharaoh’s army at the Red Sea: “<em><strong><sup>53 </sup></strong>He led them safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</em>” (Ps. 78:53). “The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, Pharaoh’s entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.” (Ex. 14:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s deliverance of the Promised Land also showed His power</u>. God showed His faithfulness to keep His covenant promises when He used His servants to drive out the pagan nations and give the Jews the Promised Land: “<em><strong><sup>54 </sup></strong>So He brought them to His holy land, to this hill country which His right hand had gained. <strong><sup>55 </sup></strong>He also drove out the nations from them and apportioned them as an inheritance by measurement, and had the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.</em>” (Ps. 78:54-55). It was only by God’s power that the Jews finally took possession of the Promised Land: “For I will drive out nations from you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.” (Ex. 34:24). “For by their own sword they did not possess the land, and their own arm did not save them, but Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence, for You favored them.” (Ps. 44:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews responded to God’s faithfulness with a lack of gratitude and rebellion</u>. After God gave the Jews the Promised Land, they took God for granted and rebelled against Him: “<em><strong><sup>56 </sup></strong>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep His testimonies, <strong><sup>57 </sup></strong>but turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers; they turned aside like a treacherous bow</em>.” (Ps. 78:56-57). The Jews’ rebellions continued and ultimately forced God to send them back into foreign bondage: “We have sinned like our fathers, we have gone astray, we have behaved wickedly.” (Ps. 106:6). “Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and because of our wrongful deeds we, our kings, and our priests have been handed over to the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to open shame, as it is this day.” (Ezra 9:7).</p></li>

<h2 id="idolatry-never-embrace-the-idols-of-the-world-over-god.-ps.-7858-72.">7. <u>Idolatry: Never Embrace the Idols of the World Over God</u>. Ps. 78:58-72.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews provoked God by turning to idols instead of trusting Him</u>. Despite all that God had done for the Jews, they failed to fully trust God and embraced the idols of the world: “<strong><sup>58 </sup></strong><em>For they provoked Him with their high places and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images. <strong><sup>59 </sup></strong>When God heard them, He was filled with wrath and He utterly rejected Israel; <strong><sup>60 </sup></strong>so that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, the tent which He had pitched among people, <strong><sup>61 </sup></strong>and He gave up His strength to captivity and His glory into the hand of the enemy. <strong><sup>62 </sup></strong>He also turned His people over to the sword, and was filled with wrath at His inheritance. <strong><sup>63 </sup></strong>Fire devoured His young men, and His virgins had no wedding songs. <strong><sup>64</sup></strong> His priests fell by the sword, and His widows could not weep. <strong><sup>65 </sup></strong>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior overcome by wine. <strong><sup>66 </sup></strong>He drove His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting disgrace. <strong><sup>67 </sup></strong>He also rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, <strong><sup>68 </sup></strong>but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved. <strong><sup>69 </sup></strong>And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has established forever. <strong><sup>70 </sup></strong>He also chose His servant David and took him from the sheepfolds; <strong><sup>71 </sup></strong>from the care of the ewes with nursing lambs He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance. <strong><sup>72 </sup></strong>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them with his skillful hands</em>.” (Ps. 78:58-72). Many believers assume that the offensive idols are limited to figures that the people worshiped. But anything that you put before God can become your idol.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God prohibits all forms of idolatry</u>. Because the Jews did not fully trust God, they embraced the idols of the world: “<strong><sup>58 </sup></strong><em>For they provoked Him with their high places and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.</em>” (Ps. 78:58). But this violated God’s Second Commandment (Ex. 20:4; 34:17; Lev. 19:4; 26:1; Dt. 5:8). They quickly and repeatedly violated this commandment: “They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a cast metal calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, ‘This is your god, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’” (Ex. 32:8; Dt. 9:12). “Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they committed infidelity with other gods and bowed down to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do the same as their fathers.” (Jdgs. 2:17). If you embrace money, drugs, alcohol, or fornication, it is just as offensive to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God was forced to repeatedly discipline the Jews because of their idolatry</u>. Because the embrace of idols showed a lack of faith and trust in God, He was forced to discipline His people: “<em><strong><sup>59 </sup></strong>When God heard them, He was filled with wrath and He utterly rejected Israel; <strong><sup>60 </sup></strong>so that He abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, the tent which He had pitched among people, <strong><sup>61 </sup></strong>and He gave up His strength to captivity and His glory into the hand of the enemy. <strong><sup>62 </sup></strong>He also turned His people over to the sword, and was filled with wrath at His inheritance. <strong><sup>63 </sup></strong>Fire devoured His young men, and His virgins had no wedding songs. <strong><sup>64</sup></strong> His priests fell by the sword, and His widows could not weep. <strong><sup>65 </sup></strong>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior overcome by wine.</em><strong><sup>”</sup></strong> (Ps. 78:59-64). The Jews’ infidelity by embracing idols repeatedly angered God (Dt. 32:16, 21; Jdgs. 2:12, 8:33). “Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people, and He loathed His inheritance.” (Ps. 106:40). He allowed the Jews to be defeated in battle. His holy presence temporarily left Israel. He then allowed His priests to be killed, and He allowed the Philistines to capture His ark (Ps. 78:60; 1 Sam. 4:10-11, 20-22; Jer. 7:12, 14; 26:6). If you embrace the idols of the world, God may also be forced to discipline you as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of mercy and grace, God did not abandon His people</u>. Despite the Jews’ unfaithfulness, God was faithful to keep His promises: “<em><strong><sup>65 </sup></strong>Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior overcome by wine. <strong><sup>66 </sup></strong>He drove His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting disgrace.</em>” (Ps. 78:65-66). But He did reject the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin because of their pride and disobedience. He instead selected the tribe of Judah to bring forth the line of kings leading to the Messiah: “<em><strong><sup>67 </sup></strong>He also rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, <strong><sup>68 </sup></strong>but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved. <strong><sup>69 </sup></strong>And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has established forever.</em>” (Ps. 78:67-68). “Judah became His sanctuary; Israel, His dominion.” (Ps. 114:4). You can give thanks that God will also never forsake or abandon you (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5). Instead of residing in a physical place, God’s holy spirit now resides in you (1 Cor. 6:19; 1 Jo. 4:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God selected David as a lowly shepherd to be the shepherd of His nation</u>. After the Jews realized the dangers in demanding a prideful and disobedient leader like Saul, God selected David because of his faith and humility to guide God’s peoples: “<em><strong><sup>70 </sup></strong>He also chose His servant David and took him from the sheepfolds; <strong><sup>71 </sup></strong>from the care of the ewes with nursing lambs He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance. <strong><sup>72 </sup></strong>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them with his skillful hands</em>.” (Ps. 78:70-72). God picked the youngest member of Jesse’s house because he loved God and served as a humble shepherd (1 Sam. 16:11-12; 2 Sam. 7:8). His greatest attribute was his love for God. His love for God and his many psalms earned him the title of the “sweet psalmist of Israel.” (2 Sam. 23:1). Jesus later came as a humble man of no reputation to become our Good Shepherd (Jo. 10:11-18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Take steps to remember God and teach others about His mercy and grace</u>. The Bible retells the story of the Jews’ rebellions to remind believers to avoid making their same mistakes: “Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them.” (1 Cor. 10:6): “[T]he overall point of the psalm needs to be made clear: the people of God must remember His marvelous works on their behalf and tell their children.” (Allen Ross, <em>A Commentary of the Psalms: Volume 2 (42-89)</em>, Kregel Academic (2013) p. 672). Jesus also cited Psalm 78 when He told the parable of the Sower (Matt. 13:1-9). “Psalm 78 manifestly teaches that Israel must remember what the Bible taught. This would fit with the parable of the Sower, where the good soil hears the word, receives it, and bears fruit (Matt. 13:23). (James M. Hamilton Jr., <em>Evangelical Bible Theology Commentary Psalms</em> (Vol. II: Psalms 73-150) (Lexham Academic 2021) p. 61). Are teaching your children and others the lessons of the Bible?</p></li>
