<h1 id="psalm-87-lessons-from-the-city-of-zion-for-praising-jesus">Psalm 87: Lessons From the City of Zion For Praising Jesus</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is one of several psalms devoted to praising Zion (Ps. 46, 48, 76, 84, 122). Zion was another name for Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5:6-7). After seizing Zion, David brought the ark there (2 Sam. 6:12). God’s Shekinah Glory later dwelled there after Solomon built the temple (1 Kgs. 8:10-11). The psalmists wrote praises for what Zion represented when God’s Shekinah Glory dwelled in Zion and what it would mean when it returned with the Messiah. These praises all foreshadowed Jesus. Through the psalmist’s praise for Zion, the Bible reveals seven lessons for praising Jesus. He is worthy of your praise because He offers you: (1) a strong foundation, (2) protection, (3) joy, (4) salvation, (5) transformation, (6) belonging, and (7) eternal life.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist praised Zion for its “foundation” in God’s holy mountains. This pointed to Jesus and His reign at the future Zion. He offers you a secure foundation and refuge. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist praised God’s love for the “gates” of Zion, the thing that made it secure from evil attacks. Because Jesus loves you, He will also protect you. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist revealed that people will speak praises for the “City of God.” Jesus offers joy for all who seek to dwell with Him, and the people will respond with praise. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist stated that certain persons from Israel’s worst enemies will be welcome in Zion. This foreshadowed the eternal salvation that Jesus offers to both Jews and gentiles. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist further stated that certain persons from Israel’s worst enemies will be referred to as having been born in Zion. Believers will be born again and transformed. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist spoke of the belonging that believers will have in Zion. Through Jesus, you can also become God’s adopted child. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist spoke of Zion’s springs of joy. Jesus offers to all who come to Him streams of abundant, eternal life.</p>
<h2 id="refuge-jesus-offers-you-a-secure-foundation-and-refuge.-ps.-871.">1. <u>Refuge: Jesus Offers You a Secure Foundation and Refuge</u>. Ps. 87:1.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God built His holy city to be a safe and secure heavenly refuge</u>. The psalmist began with two revelations to show how God’s City of Zion is unlike any human city. He built it, and it exists high up in a holy place, set apart from the sinful world: “<em>A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A Song. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> His foundation is in the holy mountains</em>.” (Ps. 87:1). “Just as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of armies, <em>in the city of our God; God will establish her forever</em>. Selah” (Ps. 48:8). These psalms referenced the past and future Jerusalem. But they also point to Jesus: “Christ himself is the Foundation of the church, which God has laid. Holiness is the strength and firmness of the church. Let us not be ashamed of the church of Christ in its meanest condition, nor of those that belong to it, since such glorious things are spoken of it. Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, even Jesus Christ. The glorious things spoken of Zion by the Spirit, were all typical of Christ, and his work and offices; of the gospel church, its privileges, and members; of heaven, its glory and perfect happiness.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 87).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus built His holy city for believers</u>. Believers have a firm “foundation” in Jesus’ holy city. It will last “forever” because He built it: “And <em>He built His sanctuary</em> like the heights, like the earth which He has established <em>forever</em>.” (Ps. 78:69). “he was looking for the city which has foundations, <em>whose architect and builder is God</em>.” (Heb. 11:10). He built this holy city for all believers, the spiritual descendants of Abraham and Sarah: “But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for <em>He has prepared a city for them</em>.” (Heb. 11:16). “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But <em>you have come to Mount Zion</em> and to the <em>city of the living God</em>, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.” (Heb. 12:22-24). “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>And <em>I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem</em>, coming down out of heaven from God, <em>prepared as a bride adorned for her husband</em>.” (Rev. 21:2-3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the chief cornerstone of His eternal refuge</u>. Believers have a firm “foundation” in Jesus’ holy city because He is the chief cornerstone: “Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, <em>I am laying <u>a stone in Zion</u></em>, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed. <em>The one who believes in it will not be disturbed</em>.”’ (Is. 28:16). “For this is contained in Scripture: ‘Behold, I am laying in <em><u>Zion</u></em> a choice stone, a precious <em>cornerstone</em>, and the one who believes in Him will not be put to shame.” (1 Pet. 2:6). But many have rejected the security and refuge that Jesus offers you: “A stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.” (Ps. 118:22). “Jesus said to them, ‘Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘A stone which the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone; this came about from the LORD, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”’ (Matt. 21:42; Mk. 12:10; Lk. 20:17). “He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the chief cornerstone.” (Acts 4:11). “having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,” (Eph. 2:20). Thus, He offers you eternal security in Zion.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus provides refuge in His holy city</u>. Believers also have a firm “foundation” in Jesus’ holy city because He has made it a place of refuge: “What answer will one give the messengers of the nation? That the <em>LORD has founded <u>Zion</u>, and the poor of His people will take <u>refuge</u> in it</em>.” (Is. 14:32). “A Song of Ascents. I will raise my eyes to the mountains; from where will my help come?” (Ps. 121:1). “<em>God is our refuge</em> and strength, a very ready help in trouble.” (Ps. 46:1). “<em>My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge</em>, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:3). “<em>The LORD will also be a stronghold for the oppressed</em>, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). “In its palaces, God has made Himself known as a stronghold.” (Ps. 48:3). “so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, <em>we who have taken refuge</em> would have strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us.” (Heb. 6:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus dwells in Zion</u>. Believers also have a firm “foundation” in Zion because Jesus dwells there: “For the Lord has chosen <u>Zion</u>; He has desired it as His dwelling place. ‘This is <em>My resting place forever</em>; <em>Here I will dwell, for I have desired it</em>.”’ (Ps. 132:13-14). “Why do you look with envy, you mountains of many peaks, at the mountain God has desired as His dwelling? Indeed, the <em>LORD will dwell there forever</em>.” (Ps. 68:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus reigns from Zion</u>. Believers also have a firm “foundation” in Zion because Jesus reigns from there: “But as for Me, I have installed <em>My King upon Zion, My holy mountain</em>.” (Ps. 2:6). “The LORD is in His holy temple; <em>the LORD’S throne is in heaven</em>; His eyes see, His eyelids test the sons of mankind.” (Ps. 11:4). “This is what the LORD says: ‘<em>Heaven is My throne</em> and the earth is the footstool for My feet. Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest?”’ (Is. 66:1). “But I say to you, take no oath at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Jerusalem, for it is <em>the City of the Great King</em>.” (Matt. 5:34-35). Thus, you can trust that He is always there, and He will never leave or forsake you (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Without Jesus, there is no eternal refuge or security</u>. Without Jesus, you have no eternal “foundation” in Jesus, you have no hope of an eternal refuge on your own: “If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?” (Ps. 11:3). Any security that believers may find in the things of the world will not last: “For <em>here we do not have a lasting city</em>, but we are seeking the city which is to come.” (Heb. 13:14). “The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 Jo. 5:12). “ . . . apart from Me you can do nothing.” (Jo. 15:5).</p></li>

<h2 id="protection-because-jesus-loves-you-he-offers-to-protect-you.-ps.-872.">2. <u>Protection: Because Jesus Loves You, He Offers to Protect You</u>. Ps. 87:2.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God blesses those who dwell with Him with protection</u>. Because God loves His people, He blesses those who choose to dwell with Him with gates that cannot be breached: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwelling places of Jacob</em>.” (Ps. 87:2). God blessed Judah’s tribe by giving it Jerusalem, the place for His redemptive plan. “But [He] chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.” (Ps. 78:68). The gates were a place where elders judged civil disputes (e.g., 2 Sam. 15:2). The gates were also a place where the community gathered (e.g., Gen. 34:20; Ruth 4:1; 2 Sam. 19:8). Commerce also took place there (e.g., Neh. 3:1; 3:32). These things likely took place at the gates because the gates could be closed for security. When believers dwell with Jesus in Zion, they will be able to engage in activities free from any evil attacks.</p></li>

<p>Jesus offers you protection from all evil in His holy City of Zion<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God blessed Jerusalem as the place where He carried out His plan for redemption</u>. Jerusalem is a holy place only because God chose it for His redemptive plan for mankind: “But [He] chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.” (Ps. 78:68). “God’s <strong>foundation</strong> is in Jerusalem, the center of His redemptive work. Since God’s work happens in time and space, it had to happen somewhere, and God chose Jerusalem as the place where much of it happened. · There Melchezidek, king and priest of God Most High, reigned and served. · There Abraham was willing to offer Isaac on the mount of the Lord where His perfect sacrifice would be provided. · There David, Israel’s greatest earthly king, reigned and made it the kingdom’s capital. · There the tabernacle of God found its fulfillment and permanence in the great temple David designed and Solomon built. · There the institutions of sacrifice, worship, and priestly service were established for centuries. · There Jesus recognized and honored the city and observed the feasts and temple rituals. · There Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and rose from the dead. · There the church was born in a day at Pentecost. · There the apostles served and sent out the Gospel. · There God will establish the physical, geographic center of His ultimate kingdom upon earth. <strong>The LORD loves the gates of Zion</strong>: For all these reasons and more, God has special love for Jerusalem, regarding it even more than the rest of His Holy Land (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Zechariah+2.12&amp;t=NKJV">Zechariah 2:12</a>) and more than the territory of Israel in general (<strong>more than all the dwellings of Jacob</strong>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 78) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus provides protection in His holy city</u>. When you stand on the firm foundation Jesus provides, He guards the gates and prevents evil from overtaking you: “Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of armies says: “My people, <em>you who dwell in Zion, do not fear</em> the Assyrian who strikes you with the rod, and lifts up his staff against you the way Egypt did.” (Is. 10:24). But you must follow Jesus to be protected: “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25). Thus, if Jesus is your Lord and Savior, He will protect you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s enemies who attack His holy city will become filled with fear</u>. In the end times, the nations will attempt to rebel against Jesus. But their rebellion will be futile: “Why are the nations restless and the peoples plotting in vain? . . . <em>the rulers conspire together<br />
against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and against His Anointed</em>, . .” (Ps. 2:1-2). “The LORD nullifies the plan of nations; He frustrates the plans of peoples.” (Ps. 33:10). “The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered; He raised His voice, the earth quaked.” (Ps. 46:6). But for those who reject Jesus, they will be filled with great dread in the face of His perfect justice: “Then He will speak to them in His anger and terrify them in His fury, saying, ‘But as for Me, <em>I have installed My King upon Zion, My holy mountain</em>.”’ (Ps. 2:5-6). They cannot cross His gates: ‘“Do you not fear Me?’ declares the LORD. ‘Do you not tremble in My presence? For <em>I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, an eternal limit, and it will not cross over it</em>. Though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they will not cross over it.” (Jer. 5:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The enemy’s attacks on God’s holy city will fail</u>. Because Jesus dwells in His holy city, no enemy can enter through its gates to defeat God’s people: “[T]he LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to save you and to defeat your enemies before you, . . .” (Dt. 23:14). During the Millennial Reign, Jesus will rule from Jerusalem. The enemy’s attempts to encircle the holy city and enter God’s gates will fail: “And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.” (Rev. 20:9). Thus, you will have eternal security and rest, free from any fear, in God’s holy Zion.</p></li>

<h2 id="joy-jesus-offers-joy-for-all-who-seek-to-dwell-with-him.-ps.-873.">3. <u>Joy: Jesus Offers Joy For All Who Seek to Dwell with Him</u>. Ps. 87:3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ City of God is filled with joy and beauty</u>. Jesus’ holy “City of God” is filled with beauty that people today cannot fully imagine. Believers will respond with joy and praise: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Glorious things are spoken of you, City of God. Selah</em>” (Ps. 87:3). This verse inspired St. Augustine of Hippo’s “The City of God.” (circa, 5<sup>th</sup> Century AD). He wrote this book in response to false claims that Christianity had caused Rome’s downfall. Professor Stephen Nichols observes that: “One of the themes that Augustine tackles is <a href="https://www.5minutesinchurchhistory.com/jonathan-edwards-favorite-word/">happiness</a> or felicity. The cities of God and man have two entirely different approaches to this question of happiness. In the city of man, happiness is attained through serving the self and living for the self. Augustine shows that this way of life is actually emptiness rather than happiness. In the city of God, happiness is found in God Himself.”<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will be praised in His holy city</u>. Believers who choose to live in Jesus’ holy city, will be filled with praise for Him: “<em><sup>1</sup> There will be silence before You, and praise <u>in Zion</u>, God, and the vow will be fulfilled for You</em>.” (Ps. 65:1). “Great is the LORD, and <em>greatly to be praised in <u>the city of our God</u>, His holy mountain</em>. Beautiful in elevation, <em>the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion</em> in the far north, the city of the great King.” (Ps. 48:1-2). “Out of <u>Zion</u>, the perfection of beauty, God has shone.” (Ps. 50:2). Thus, you have many reasons to be thankful and for the wonderful things that await you in Zion.</p></li>

<h2 id="salvation-jesus-offers-salvation-to-both-jews-and-gentiles.-ps.-874.">4. <u>Salvation: Jesus Offers Salvation to Both Jews and Gentiles</u>. Ps. 87:4.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Even God’s worst enemies will have the opportunity to dwell in Zion</u>. Jesus offers salvation to even Israel’s worst enemies, like Egypt (Is. 30:7 Rahab) and Babylon: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>‘I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; behold, Philistia and Tyre with Cush: ‘This one was born there</em>.’’” (Ps. 87:4). “The Almighty is introduced as making a revelation to the psalmist. He will cause the Gentiles to flock into his Church, even those who have been hitherto the most bitter enemies of Israel (ver. 4), and will place these strangers on a par with such as have belonged to his Church from their birth (vers. 4, 5, 6), admitting them to every blessing and every privilege . . . Verse 4.- I will make mention of Rahab; i.e. of Egypt. The context requires this meaning, which is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>. Literally ‘Rahab’ means ‘pride, arrogance.’ And Babylon. The fitting counterpart of Egypt, equally antagonistic to Israel, and equally lifted up with pride and presumption. To them that know me; rather, <strong>among them that know me</strong>; <strong>i.e.</strong> as belonging to them, included in their number (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-21.htm">Isaiah 19:21</a>, ‘And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians <strong>shall know the Lord</strong> in that day;’ and see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-8.htm">Psalm 82:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a>). Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia. Other hostile nations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-13</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 87:4).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers eternal life with Him in His city in Zion</u>. David revealed that “<em>the salvation of Israel would come out of <u>Zion</u></em>! When the LORD restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.” (Ps. 14:7). “A Song of Ascents. When the LORD brought back <em>the captives of <u>Zion</u></em>, we were like those who dream.” (Ps. 126:1). Thus, eternal salvation brings the right to dwell with Jesus in Zion. Jesus gave His life so that all who believe can live with Him forever: “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Ro. 5:8). “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” (Jo. 10:11). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). His blood is the symbol and proof of His covenant. “And He said to them, ‘This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.’” (Mk. 14:24; Lk. 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25; Jer. 31:31). What Jesus offers is also free (Ro. 6:26). To live in His eternal city, you only need faith in Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ plan for redemption has always included both Jews and gentiles</u>. God’s redemptive promise to Israel’s enemies was no accident. He offers salvation to all, and He does not want any to perish: “God promised to bless all the families of the earth in Abraham and his seed (Gen. 12:1-3; 22:18), and once Jesus completed His work He received all authority in heaven and on earth and commissioned His followers to make disciples of all the nations (Matt. 28:18-20). These disciples of Jesus proclaimed the life-giving, regenerative new birth made possible by the power of the Holy Spirit through faith in Jesus, and people of every tribe and tongue and nation experience new life <em>as those born in Zion</em>.” (James M. Hamilton Jr., <em>Evangelical Bible Theology Commentary Psalms</em> (Vol. II: Psalms 73-150) (Lexham Academic 2021) p. 120) (italics added).</p></li>

<h2 id="transformation-believers-will-be-born-again-and-transformed.-ps.-875.">5. <u>Transformation: Believers Will Be Born Again and Transformed</u>. Ps. 87:5.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will transform all who believe to dwell in His holy city</u>. Those who believe by faith (including God’s former enemies) will be transformed and born again into His family: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>But of Zion it will be said, ‘This one and that one were born in her”; and the Most High Himself will establish her</em>.”’ (Ps. 87:5). “The psalmist is now the speaker of verses 5 and 6, telling what the LORD does in Zion. . . Ever increasing numbers will ‘be born’ in Zion as people from every nation become incorporated as her children. The figure of being born, repeated from verse 4, is intended to signify the conversion of people from the nations to the rights of citizenship in Zion (so it is an implied comparison). To be born in Zion is a way of saying one is recorded for life as a citizen of the city of God. This happened sporadically in the history of the holy city, even into gospel times. But what is described here will be fully realized in the future city of God (see Isa. 54:1-2; 62:4-5; and 65:18-24), when the Most High will establish her (Ps. 93:1).” (Allen Ross, <em>A Commentary of the Psalms: Volume 2 (42-89)</em>, Kregel Academic (2013) p. 803).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith in Jesus, you will be born again in heaven</u>. Consistent with the psalmist’s description, Jesus also promises that you will be born again in heaven. “Jesus responded and said to him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God’ . . . Jesus answered, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”’ (Jo. 3:3, 5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith in Jesus, you will be transformed into a new creation</u>. Also consistent with the psalmist’s description, Jesus promises that you will become a new creation: “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, this person is a <em>new creation</em>; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Cor. 5:17). “Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may walk in newness of life.” (Ro. 6:4). Believers are called upon to live as new creations: “Therefore I urge you, brothers <em>and sisters,</em> by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, <em>which is</em> your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Rom. 12:1-2)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="belonging-through-jesus-you-can-become-gods-adopted-child.-ps.-876.">6. <u>Belonging: Through Jesus, You Can Become God’s Adopted Child</u>. Ps. 87:6.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will regard all who are grafted in by faith as belonging to Him</u>. God will then carefully count, register, and watch over each of His adopted children in heaven: “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>The Lord will count when He registers the peoples, ‘This one was born there.’ Selah”</em> (Ps. 87:6). Hebrews also says that believers will be “enrolled” in heaven: “But you have come to <em>Mount Zion</em> and to the city of the living God, <em>the heavenly Jerusalem</em>, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are <em>enrolled</em> in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,” (Heb. 12:22-23). In the NKJV, the Greek word for “enrolled” is better translated as “registered.” This careful attention is a sign of God’s love: “Man by man will the Lord reckon them, for they are each one precious in his sight; the individual shall not be lost in the mass, but each one shall be of high account.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 87).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God will consider all the residents of Zion as His adopted children</u>. Consistent with the psalmist’s promises, Jesus also promises that you will be considered an adopted child of God in heaven. “He predestined us to adoption as sons and daughters through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,” (Eph. 1:5). “But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name,” (Jo. 1:12). “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons and daughters of God . . . The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,” (Ro. 8:14, 16). Thus, you have many reasons to celebrate and praise Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God registered each of His adopted children in the book of life</u>. The psalmist and the author of Hebrews both wrote that God would “register” His people (Ps. 87:6; Heb. 12:23). Isaiah also wrote of people being “recorded” in Zion: “And it will come about that the <em>one who is left in <u>Zion</u> and remains behind in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is <u>recorded</u> for life in Jerusalem</em>.” (Is. 4:3). This registration most likely refers to being recorded in God’s book of eternal life: “Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but <em>rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven</em>.” (Lk. 10:20). “Indeed, true companion, I ask you also, help these women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, <em>whose names are in the book of life</em>.” (Phil. 4:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s people will know that they belong in the heaven He created for them</u>. Even though no person has a right to be in heaven based upon his or her works, each person will feel a sense of belonging in God’s holy Zion: “<em>For our citizenship is in heaven</em>, from which we also eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;” (Phil. 3:20). “So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but <em>you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household</em>,” (Eph. 2:19). “But the <em>Jerusalem</em> above is free; <em>she is our mother</em>.” (Gal. 4:26). “For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.” (Heb. 13:14). “He who overcomes, <em>I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God</em>, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God. And <em>I will write on him My new name</em>.” (Rev. 3:12).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The city of God offers eternal life</u>. In Zion, God’s people will find streams of abundant life and respond with songs of joy: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes will say, ‘All my springs of joy are in you</em>.’” (Ps. 87:7). The spring of eternal life will flow from Jesus to all His believers: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy, the holy dwelling places of the Most High. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.” (Ps. 46:4-5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the New Jerusalem, Jesus will restore His waters of life and joy</u>. When God created Eden, Adam and Eve drank from His waters of life: “Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.” (Gen. 2:10). Although this living water was lost because of mankind’s original sin, Zechariah, Ezekiel and Isaiah all promised that this living water would flow again from a future Jerusalem where the Messiah will reign forever: “And on that day <em>living waters will flow out of Jerusalem</em>, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.” (Zech. 14:8). “And by the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month because <em>their water flows from the sanctuary</em>, and their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.” (Ezek. 47:12). “But there the majestic One, the LORD, will be for us a place of rivers and wide canals on which no boat with oars will go, and on which no mighty ship will pass—” (Is. 33:21). Jesus was and is the source of this living water: “The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’” (Jo. 7:38). His living water will flow from Him in the New Jerusalem: “for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to <em>springs of the water of life</em>; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:17). “And he showed me a <em>river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb</em>,” (Rev. 22:1). Are you praising Jesus for what He prepared for you?</p></li>

<li><p><u>Zion will also be a city of peace</u>. Isaiah also stated that the rivers which come from God bring His peace: “For this is what the LORD says: ‘<em>Behold, I extend peace to her like a river</em>, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and rocked back and forth on the knees.” (Is. 66:12). Ezekiel also promised that God’s people would one day enjoy a covenant of peace: “And I will make <em>a covenant of peace</em> with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and set My sanctuary in their midst forever.” (Ezek. 37:26). Those who persevere in their faith can live in the New Jerusalem and enjoy eternal peace: “The one who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new name.” (Rev. 3:12; 21:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also offers you eternal joyful fellowship in heaven</u>. The ability to dwell with Jesus in heaven will also bring great joy: “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.” (Is. 35:10). “So that I may tell of all Your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.” (Ps. 9:14; 21:6). “So my soul shall rejoice in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation.” (Ps. 35:9). Paul described the joy of heaven as something beyond what humans have seen or experienced (1 Cor. 2:9). In heaven, you can also look forward to an eternity of rejoicing: “Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,” (Rev. 5:11). Are you praising Jesus for what He did on the cross to make this eternal fellowship and joy possible?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Everyone will come together to praise Jesus in Zion for His wells of eternal life</u>. In response to Jesus’ mercy, grace, righteousness, and springs of living water, all will come to praise Him in Zion. “Therefore you will <em>joyously draw water from the springs of salvation</em>. And on that day you will say, “Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; make them remember that His name is exalted. Praise the LORD in song, for He has done glorious things; let this be known throughout the earth. <em>Rejoice and shout for joy, you inhabitant of <u>Zion</u></em>, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.” (Is. 12:3-6). “All nations whom You have made will come and worship before You, Lord, and they will glorify Your name.” (Ps. 86:9). “And it shall be from new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath, <em>all mankind will come to bow down before Me</em>,” says the LORD.” (Is. 66:23). “Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; <em>for all the nations will come and worship before You</em>, for Your righteous acts have been revealed.” (Rev. 15:4). Thus, you have many reasons to stop and give thanks to Jesus. You also have many reasons to share your testimony and the hope that lies in you with the lost (Matt. 28:16-20).</p></li>
