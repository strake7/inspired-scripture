<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 11 contains 31 unique principles for living according to God’s wisdom. But a common theme contrasts the “righteous” with the “wicked”. To some, this might be interpreted as “good” verses “evil” persons. But most Christians will know from Paul’s writings that every person is a sinner. “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Ro. 3:23). It is only through faith in Jesus’ atoning sacrifice that a believer is made “righteous.” (E.g., Ro. 3:22; Gal. 2:16). But Paul’s teaching of universal sin was not a new concept. In fact, Solomon repeatedly declared that every person is a sinner before God. “Who can say, ‘I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin’?” (Prov. 20:9). “Indeed, there is not a righteous person on earth who always does good and does not ever sin.” (Ecc. 7:20; see also, 1 Kgs. 8:46; 2 Chr. 6:36). Thus, no one can be “righteous” before God merely by claiming to be a “good” person. Instead, sin has to first be atoned for through the shedding of blood before a person can then seek to draw closer to God (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). Jesus’ blood atonement on the cross was a one-time sacrifice (Heb. 10:14; Matt. 26:28; Eph. 1:7). After a person repents, believers should then seek to be “sanctified” by drawing closer to Jesus through His righteous. They must do so even though they will fall short in their efforts. “Therefore you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48). Paul restated this idea by urging believers try to “imitate” Jesus, even though they would never walk without sin as Jesus did. “Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;” (Eph. 5:1). In Proverbs 11, the Bible reveals several signs of a righteous believer in Christ. These include: (1) seeking to imitate Jesus, (2) loving others, (3) persevering in their faith, (4) holiness, (5) generosity, (6) trusting Jesus over wealth, and (7) evangelism.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon urged believers to seek Yahweh’s righteousness and avoid wickedness. A righteous person seeks to imitate Jesus’ perfect example. <u>Second</u>, in several additional proverbs, Solomon calls upon believers to seek Yahweh’s righteousness by loving others in need. A righteous person also shows Jesus’ love to others in need. <u>Third</u>, in other proverbs, Solomon revealed that the righteous persevere to find life and avoid God’s judgment. Through faith, Jesus transforms you and gives you the strength to persevere and find eternal life. <u>Fourth</u>, in other proverbs, Solomon called upon believers to be holy for God. Those who are made righteous through Jesus should also seek to remain holy for His use. <u>Fifth</u>, in other proverbs, Solomon revealed that the righteous are generous to those in need. Every good and perfect thing is from above. Jesus also calls upon believers to be generous in sharing His provision with those in need. <u>Sixth</u>, in other proverbs, Solomon states that the righteous trust in doing Yahweh’s will and not in their wealth. Jesus also wants you to be righteous by trusting in Him. He will in turn provide. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon stated that “<em>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and one who is wise gains souls</em>.” (Prov. 11:30). Those who are made righteous by their faith seek to evangelize the lost by directing them to find salvation and righteousness in Jesus.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>A righteous person does not defraud others in their business dealings</u>. As Yahweh’s representative, Solomon taught that a righteous believer will never deceive others in their business dealings. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>A false balance is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em> <em>but a just weight is His delight</em>.” (Prov. 11:1). “Honesty and integrity are at the foundation of social duties, which the author is now teaching. Hence comes the reiteration of these warnings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-11.htm"><u>Proverbs 16:11</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-10.htm"><u>Proverbs 20:10</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 11:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A transformed believer acts with integrity in all his dealings with others</u>.  In Old Testament times, the primary means of calculating a fair price in commerce was with a scale.  Thus, God’s people were warned against manipulating their scales to increase their profits:  “‘You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or capacity. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt.’”  (Lev. 19:35-36; Dt. 25:13-15; Ez. 45:10). “Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are abominable to the LORD.”  (Prov. 20:10). “Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD, and a false scale is not good.” (Prov. 20:23). “Can I justify dishonest balances, and a bag of fraudulent weights?” (Hosea 12:7).  Persons who defraud others will also face God’s judgment  (Micah 6:11).  This warning also applies to Christians. “Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,” (1 Pet. 2:1). Jesus was blameless in all His dealings. Believers should imitate His example.</p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person seeks to be humble and avoid pride</u>. God-fearing believers also try to be humble and avoid exalting themselves. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom</em>.” (Prov. 11:2). “When pride cometh, then cometh shame, .... The one follows the other, or rather keep pace together; as soon as one comes, the other comes; as in the case of the angels that sinned, Adam and Eve, Haman, Nebuchadnezzar, and others; and will be the case of the Romish antichrist, who, while vaunting and priding himself in his glory and grandeur, will fall into shame, disgrace, and destruction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm"><u>Revelation 18:7</u></a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 11:2).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The righteous follow Jesus’ narrow path and avoid the many paths of destruction<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus includes “hating” pride</u>.  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of all knowledge  (Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Ps. 111:10).  The fear of the Lord is defined as “hating” evil, which includes pride:  “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; <em>pride</em> and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.”  (Prov. 8:13; Ps. 97:10; Jam. 4:6; 1 Pet. 5;5; Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). The unsaved who are filled with pride and boasting will one day face God’s judgment: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18).  “A man’s pride will bring him low, . . .”  (Prov. 29:23). “The boastful will not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do injustice.” (Ps. 5:5). Satan is the father of pride.  His pride also caused his downfall.  He desired that others bow before him because of a blessing he did not earn (Is. 14:13-16).  When you are prideful, you are also under his influence. Instead, believers should imitate Jesus’ example. He humbled Himself and became a servant so that all might live (Phil. 2:7_.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous person follows Jesus’ righteous example</u>. A person can walk by faith in Jesus’ righteous example and find life or find destruction by living according to the flesh. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The integrity of the upright will guide them, but the perversity of the treacherous will destroy them</em>.” (Prov. 11:3). “The proverb states the contrasting internal principles of the righteous and the wicked … [The righteous] display a lifestyle of complete loyalty to <em>I AM</em> and to others. That lifestyle shepherds them in the way of salvation. By contrast, the perfidy of the perverse powerfully boomerangs to shatter them. The Hebrew root of <em>perversity</em> denotes twisting, distorting, and so overthrowing truth through speech (Exod. 23:8; Prov. 15:4) or other behaviors that cause ruin (Job 12:19; Prov. 13:6; 19:3; 21:12). Perversity is the inalienable possession of <em>the treacherous</em>, and it <em>devastates them.</em>” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 11:3) (italics in original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Strive to walk in Jesus’ path of righteousness<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the light who guides those made righteous through faith who seek His fellowship</u>. Yahweh promised to guide the path of the righteous. “The way of the righteous is smooth; o Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.” (Is. 26:7). Jesus is the light of the world who guides those who seek to do His will in the world. “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12; 1 Jo. 1:5-7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person trusts in Jesus for salvation while the wicked trust in their wealth</u>. Those made righteous through Jesus will be blessed with salvation while those who trust wealth face judgment. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Riches do not benefit on the day of wrath, but righteousness rescues from death</em>.” (Prov. 11:4). “In this verse, we are reminded of the true value of righteousness in comparison to material wealth. It tells us that when we face difficulties or ‘the day of wrath,’ as mentioned in the King James Version, having riches will not save us. When the times get tough, our wealth becomes irrelevant in securing our safety or peace. The verse emphasizes the concept that living righteously is the path that leads to true life, delivering us from death and troubles.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 11:4).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Wealth cannot redeem a person’s soul at the time of judgment</u>. The Bible repeatedly warns against trusting in your wealth. “They will fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to save them on the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their appetite, nor can they fill their stomachs, because their wrongdoing has become a cause of stumbling.” (Ezek. 7:19). “Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD’S anger; and all the earth will be devoured by the fire of His jealousy, for He will make a complete end, indeed a horrifying one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.” (Zeph. 1:18). “Those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches? No one can by any means redeem another or give God a ransom for him—” (Ps. 49:6-7). “For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26; Mk. 8:36-37). Jesus lived a simple lifestyle and trusted in God the Father. Believers should imitate Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous follows Jesus’ narrow path to find peace and security</u>. Those who follow the example of Jesus’ righteous life will enjoy His protection while the wicked will face eventual judgment. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The righteousness of the blameless will smooth his way, but the wicked will fall by his own wickedness</em>.” (Prov. 11:5). “In this verse, we see a powerful contrast between two types of people: the blameless and the wicked. The blameless, or righteous person, walks a straight path, guided by their integrity and morality. They make choices that align with what is right, leading to a life filled with peace and purpose. On the other hand, the wicked person, who chooses to act immorally or with malevolence, ends up stumbling and falling due to their own wickedness. Their poor choices lead to their downfall, both in this life and beyond.” (Jamie Wilson on Prov. 11:5).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you walk in Jesus’ righteousness, He will guide your path</u>. When you follow Jesus’ wisdom, He will guide you to safety. “I have instructed you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in upright paths.” (Prov. 4:11). “He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.” (Ps. 23:3; 37:23-24). “You enlarge my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.” (2 Sam. 22:37). “The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.” (Is. 26:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who seek after Jesus’ righteousness will find His deliverance and provision</u>. Jesus in His righteousness will deliver the faithful while those who trust in their own evil instincts will become trapped in sin and face judgement. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>The righteousness of the upright will rescue them, but the treacherous will be caught by their own greed</em>.” (Prov. 11:6). “A righteous person escapes from trouble and death. Trouble cannot trap him or defeat him. Leading a godly life means not engaging in the crooked, deceptive sins which lead to natural consequences. Godliness also leaves others no room for criticism, making it harder for evil people to tell lies about the godly person. His pursuit of righteousness empowers him to triumph over both.” (Biblere.com on Prov. 11:6).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek after Jesus’ righteousness, and He will provide for your needs</u>. Solomon promised that “righteousness” can “rescue” or “guard” you. “Ill-gotten gains do not benefit, but righteousness rescues from death.” (Prov. 10:2). “Righteousness guards the one whose way is blameless, but wickedness brings the sinner to ruin.” (Prov. 13:6). Believers are made righteous through faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:22). When you seek after His righteousness, you can trust Him to provide for your needs. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31). If you want what He wants, He will give you your heart’s desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous place their hope in eternal life in Jesus while the wicked have no hope</u>. Faith in Jesus provides a path to eternal life through His righteousness. The wicked have no such hope. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>When a wicked person dies, his expectation will perish, and the hope of strong people perishes</em>.” (Prov. 11:7). “When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 11:7).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t put your hope in worldly things</u>. Nothing that you accumulate in this lifetime can be taken into the next. “For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either.” (1 Tim. 6:7). “As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so he will return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.” (Ecc. 5:15). Thus, Jesus urges every person to have faith in Him and invest their time, talent, and treasure into His Kingdom. “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21; Lk. 16:13). Jesus lived His life in faith knowing that God the Father would resurrect Him. You can imitate Jesus by having a similar faith.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous seek deliverance through Jesus</u>. While the wicked will become ensnared by their evil acts, the righteous turn to Jesus for deliverance from all forms of evil, trials, and tribulations. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The righteous is rescued from trouble, but the wicked takes his place</em>.” (Prov. 11:8). “God is at hand to help the righteous out of straits … The evil from which the righteous is saved fails upon the wicked … Of this substitution many instances occur in Scripture. Thus Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm"><u>Esther 7:10</u></a>); Daniel's accusers were cast into the den of lions from which he was saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm"><u>Daniel 6:24</u></a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm"><u>Isaiah 43:4</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 11:8).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will deliver those made righteous through their faith in Him</u>. The devil is powerless to take those made righteous through faith in Jesus. “and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.” (Jo. 10:28-29). “then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from a trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,” (2 Pet. 2:9). “The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.” (2 Tim. 4:18).</p></li>

<h2 id="love-a-righteous-person-shows-jesus-love-to-others.-prov.-1112-18."><strong>2. <u>Love: A Righteous Person Shows Jesus’ Love to Others</u>. Prov. 11:12-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A righteous person speaks words of life and avoids speech that destroys others</u>. While the wicked will employ gossip, slander, and lies to destroy others, a righteous person is motivated by the love of Christ to speak words of loving truth to others. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>With his mouth the godless person destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous will be rescued</em>.” (Prov. 11:9). “One of the identifying marks of the <strong>hypocrite</strong> is that they destroy people with their words. Sincere love looks to build others up, not to destroy them… <strong>Through knowledge the righteous will be delivered</strong>: God’s deliverance comes to the <strong>righteous</strong> through their <strong>knowledge</strong>, both in the sense of wisdom and in the sense of personal relationship with God.” (David Guzik, Prov. 11:9) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Speak words that direct others to Jesus’ righteousness, and refrain from evil speech</u>. Solomon stated that the tongue has the power to bless or curse. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:21). Thus, you cannot claim to be religious if you cannot control yourself from using the speech that Jesus gave you to slander, demean, or gossip. “If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this person’s religion is worthless.” (Jam. 1:26). A person seeking after Jesus’ righteousness uses their speech to lead others to Him. “With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be this way.” (Jam. 3:9-10).</p></li>

<p>Be righteous by speaking words of loving truth about Jesus to others<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous create joy by leading others to Jesus</u>. The righteous seek success through others turning to Jesus. This leads to others finding joy. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>When things go well for the righteous, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, there is joyful shouting</em>.” (Prov. 11:10). “[A]t the time of the reformation, when the pure doctrines of the Gospel were revived, which were both times of joy to the city of God; so in the latter day, when the Lord’s people will be righteous, the church will be the joy of many generations; and when the kingdom shall be given to the saints of the most High, and the kingdoms of the world become the Lord's and his Christ’s, there will be great voices in heaven, rejoicings in the church, and a new song sung, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-21.htm"><u>Isaiah 60:21</u></a>; and when the wicked perish, there is shouting; as there will be great rejoicings, shoutings, and hallelujahs, when Babylon is fallen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-20.htm"><u>Revelation 18:20</u></a>.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 11:10).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The angels celebrate when sinners repent and become righteous through faith</u>. Proverbs 11:10 is fulfilled when any sinner repents and finds eternal life through Jesus. The angels then celebrate. “What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and go and search for the one that is lost? And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that have not gone astray. So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.” (Matt. 18:12-14). “I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.” (Lk. 15:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous bless Jesus’ people through their prayers and their actions</u>. While wicked cut others down, the righteous seek to bless others. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked, it is torn down</em>.” (Prov. 11:11). “<strong>By the blessing of the upright.—</strong>Especially by their prayers, which, like Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>)<em>, </em>and the Jews of the captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>) they offer for those with whom they live.” (Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 11:11).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous show Jesus’ light</u>. When you live in Jesus’ righteousness, you seek to bless others. “Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.” (Prov. 14:34). Thus, Jesus wants you to let His light shine through you to guide the lost. “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people. You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:13-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous show love to their neighbors through forgiveness and discretion</u>. While the wicked seek to tear others down by gossiping about another’s sins, the righteous seek to rehabilitate the lost through forgiveness and discretion in sharing another’s sins. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>One who despises his neighbor lacks sense, but a person of understanding keeps silent</em>.” (Prov. 11:12). “It is a great weakness to speak contemptuously of any man, or to endeavor to render him ridiculous, though he may have erred, because he possibly may return to a right way of thinking and acting for the future; and it is cruel to insult over errors committed through human infirmity; therefore a prudent person says nothing to the reproach of anyone.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Prov. 11:12-13).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous forgive those who offend them and instead seek loving reconciliation</u>. The New Testament reveals that hatred is a form of murder. “Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.” (1 Jo. 3:15). “But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be answerable to the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.” (Matt. 5:22). Thus, believers must control their anger. “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;” (Jam. 1:19; Prov. 14:29; 29:11). Your words should be gracious. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29). Instead of hating those who offend you, you must show them love. “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.” (Jo. 13:34-35).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous conceal another person’s sins to help rehabilitate them</u>. While the wicked use another person’s sins to gossip about them, a righteous person shows love to sinners by concealing their sins unless disclosure is necessary. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets, but one who is trustworthy conceals a matter</em>.” (Prov. 11:13). “The man who comes to us with tales about others will reveal our secrets also. Faithfulness is shown, not only in doing what a man has been commissioned to do, but in doing it quietly and without garrulity.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 11:13).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous refrain from gossiping about another’s sins to lead them to restoration</u>. Believers should conceal another person’s offenses out of love. “One who conceals an offense seeks love, but one who repeats a matter separates close friends.” (Prov. 17:9). “A perverse person spreads strife, and a slanderer separates close friends.” (Prov. 16:28). “One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a gossip.” (Prov. 20:19). Love can lead a sinner to Jesus, and it covers a multitude of sins. “let him know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.” (Jam. 5:20). “Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8). Limited exceptions to this rule exist when necessary to protect others from unrepentant sinners.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous surround themselves with godly counsel and offer godly counsel to others</u>. While a person will fail without Spirit-led guidance, the righteous succeed when they seek and offer godly counsel. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is victory</em>.” (Prov. 11:14). “Proverbs 11:4 calls us to value and seek out wise counsel. Whether you are navigating personal challenges or leading a group, remember the power of collective wisdom. Surround yourself with advisors who are not only knowledgeable but also grounded in godly principles. Aligning yourself with a biblical path that leads to safety and success is done by doing so. We should all strive to seek and heed wise counsel in our lives, fostering communities and decisions that reflect God’s wisdom and guidance.” (Reverent Michael Johnson on Prov. 11:14)<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Seek godly counsel the same way Moses did with Jethro (Ex. 13-27).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous surround themselves with godly counsel</u>. Solomon later repeated his encouragement to seek godly counsel. “Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with many counselors they succeed.” (Prov. 15:22). In order to serve Jesus and help others, He warns believers that they need to carefully prepare (Lk. 14:28-31). This begins with prayer. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). But believers should also seek godly counsel. Even Moses was willing to receive the wise counsel of Jethro about the need for him to delegate responsibilities (Ex. 18:13-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous seek to avoid being placed into bondage while helping others</u>. Out of love, the righteous should lend to the poor without interest (Ex. 22:25; Dt. 23:19). But they must be careful to avoid potential financial bondage by becoming a guarantor for another person’s future debts. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>One who is a guarantor for a stranger will certainly suffer for it, but one who hates being a guarantor is secure</em>.” (Prov. 11:15). “This repeated warning against suretyship (<em>chapt. 6:1-5</em>) is intended to help us keep a proper value about helping others. It doesn’t lend itself to the teaching that we are to become selfish, or to dry our source of helpful sympathy. To go surety for a stranger is a most dangerous thing, as thousands have learned to their sorrow.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 11:15).<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Avoid circumstances where you take on financial obligations that you cannot afford</u>. Solomon warned about the dangers of becoming a surety or guarantor of another person’s unknown future debts (Prov. 6:1-2). This is a warning that he would later repeat. “A person lacking in sense shakes hands and becomes guarantor in the presence of his neighbor.” (Prov. 17:18). “Do not be among those who shake hands, among those who become guarantors for debts. If you have nothing with which to repay, why should he take your bed from under you?” (Prov. 22:26-27). “Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law.” (Ro. 13:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus freed you from bondage, don’t place yourself back into bondage</u>.  Jesus was born as a human to be our kinsman redeemer.  It is only through faith in Him that your debts are forgiven (Heb. 9:22; 10:14; Lev. 17:11).  On the first day of His public ministry, He entered the synagogue and read from Isaiah 61:1-2.  He then declared that “He has come to proclaim release to the captives . . . to set free those who are oppressed,” Jesus proclaimed: “Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  (Lk. 4:14-21). But the devil will always try to enslave you.  Taking on unknown, future debt obligations is one of many ways for the devil to do that.  Jesus wants you to be free from all kinds of bondage.  Thus, you should never place yourself in bondage through debts that you cannot afford:  “It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.”  (Gal. 5:1).  “For you were called to freedom,  . . .”  (Gal. 5:13).  “For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face.”  (2 Cor. 11:2).  “For you have not received a spirit of slavery ...”  (Rom. 8:15).  “So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.”  (Jo. 8:36).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person obtains God’s honor through the person’s loving character</u>. A person transformed by Jesus’ righteousness, shows grace, and avoids hurting others through the pursuit of worldly things. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>A gracious woman attains honor, and ruthless men attain riches</em>.” (Prov. 11:16). “A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 11:16).<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> As one example of this, Ruth “was a widow, she was poor, and she was a woman. Yet she retained her honor. Boaz could say to her, ‘… for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman’ (Ruth 3:11).” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 11:16).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Ruth was a gracious woman in serving her mother-in-law Naomi, and God honored her<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A righteous person’s beauty comes from godly character, not appearance</u>. The fear of the Lord is far more important than your appearance. “Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised.” (Prov. 31:30). God cares about what is in your heart, not your outward appearance (1 Sam. 16:7). “Your adornment must not be merely the external—braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or putting on apparel; but it should be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.” (1 Pet. 3:3-4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person receives Jesus’ blessings through mercy and forgiveness</u>. Forgiving those who harm you and letting go of your feelings of anger is one of the best gifts you can give yourself. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>A merciful person does himself good, but the cruel person does himself harm</em>.” (Prov. 11:17). “Our good and evil deeds return to us in blessings or curses.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 11:17).<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person is merciful towards others who cause the person harm</u>. Jesus promises that those who show mercy towards others will in turn be blessed to receive His mercy.  “For if you forgive other people for their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  But if you do not forgive other people, then your Father will not forgive your offenses.”  (Matt. 6:14-15; Lk. 6:36-37).   “For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.” (Jam. 2:13).  Jesus forgave those who crucified Him (Lk. 23:34).  Believers should follow His righteous example.</p></li>
<li><p><u>A righteous person stores up blessings in heaven</u>. While the wicked are judged by the harm they cause others, the righteous store up blessings in heaven by loving others. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>A wicked person earns deceptive wages, but one who sows righteousness gets a true reward</em>.” (Prov. 11:18). “To ‘sow righteousness’ is to act righteously, to live in such a way that the result is holiness. The ‘reward,’ in a Jew’s eyes, would be a long life in which to enjoy the fruits of his good conduct. We Christians have a better hope, which is, perhaps, adumbrated by this analogy: as the seed sown in the field does not produce its fruit till the time of harvest, so righteousness meets with its full recompense only in the great harvest at the end of all things.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 11:18).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous produce good fruit as the result of their faith, and they will be rewarded</u>. Those who live by the Holy Spirit will reap the reward of eternal life while those who live according to the flesh will reap judgment. “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:7-8; Ro. 8:13). Jesus promises that you will know whether a person is living by the Spirit or their flesh according to their fruits (Matt. 7:16-20). Out of love, Jesus suffered a brutal death at the cross so that others might live (Jo. 3:16). He is now honored for His sacrifice. Believers should also love others and store up rewards.</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-the-righteous-are-saved-by-their-faith-in-jesus.-prov.-1119-21."><strong>3. <u>Faith: The Righteous are Saved By Their Faith in Jesus</u>. Prov. 11:19-21.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous persevere in their faith and find eternal life</u>. A person transformed through faith in Jesus perseveres through trials and is rewarded with eternal life. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>One who is steadfast in righteousness attains life,</em> <em>but one who pursues evil attains his own death</em>.” (Prov. 11:19). This life comes through faith and not our outward acts. “As righteousness tendeth to life,.... Or, is unto life: not mere outward acts of moral righteousness; these may be done where there is no principle of spiritual life, and are no other than dead works, and will never bring to everlasting life; indeed the best righteousness of man's is no justification of life, nor can it entitle to it, nor is meritorious of it … Internal grace, or powerful godliness, which is the new man that is created in righteousness, gives a meetness for everlasting life, and issues in it; particularly the righteousness of Christ, as that is a perfectly justifying one; it makes a man alive in a law sense, and gives a title and claim to eternal life;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 11:19).<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The righteous should remain steadfast in their faith in Jesus<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through faith, Jesus transforms you with His righteousness and offers eternal life</u>. Jesus offers eternal life to all who believe. “The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” (Jo. 3:36). “Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.” (Jo. 5:24). “Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.” (Jo. 6:47). But the “righteous” must remain “steadfast.” (Prov. 11:19). Those who persevere in their faith will be blessed with Jesus’ crown of life. “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.” (Jam. 1:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person made righteous though Jesus should desire to walk in His righteousness</u>. While Jesus hates evil, He delights in those who walk in His righteousness. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>The perverse in heart are an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but the blameless in their walk are His delight</em>.” (Prov. 11:20). “Those that are arrogant and rebellious in their hearts are obnoxious to the Lord. The man that walks upright is the delight of the Lord. God is delighted when His children are walking in the ways of wisdom.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 11:20).<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Show the transformation of your heart by walking with Jesus</u>. A heart that devises evil is one of the forms of wickedness that God “hates.” (Prov. 6:16-19). Jesus’ greatest condemnations were again the religious leaders who led others astray (e.g., Matt. 23:27-28). As a fruit of your faith and because you represent His light, He desires that you try to be blameless in your walk with Him. “Therefore you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48). Those who are pure in heart are blessed to see Him. “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matt. 5:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person made righteous through Jesus is rescued from eternal punishment</u>. While the wicked will reap what they have sown on Earth, Jesus will protect those made righteous through faith from eternal wrath and the trials and tribulations in the world. “<strong><sup>21</sup></strong> <em>Be assured, the evil person will not go unpunished, but the descendants of the righteous will be rescued</em>.” (Prov. 11:21). “There is a dual meaning to Proverbs 11:21 – Firstly, God will deliver us from eternal condemnation and judgment, but secondly, whatever we go through on earth, God will be with us through it and bring us out the other side. This is where we need to walk in faith and trust God. There is a temptation to lean on our own understanding and try to work things out, but as we trust God with every detail of our lives, He will lead us on the path to victory:” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 11:21).<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Salvation and Jesus’ righteousness are free gifts that the wicked foolishly reject</u>. To become righteous and escape eternal punishment, you only need to accept the free gift of faith in Jesus. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:23; Jo. 5:24). “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 2:24). Those who reject His gift face judgment and a “second death” (Rev. 21:6-8).</p></li>

<h2 id="holiness-the-righteous-seek-to-be-holy-for-jesus-use.-prov.-1122-23."><strong>4. <u>Holiness: The Righteous Seek to be Holy for Jesus’ Use</u>. Prov. 11:22-23.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>As the bride of Christ, believers should desire to remain holy for Him</u>. Those transformed by Jesus’ righteousness should not freely discard the purity that He purchased for you at the cross. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>As a ring of gold in a pig’s snout</em> <em>so is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion</em>.” (Prov. 11:22). “The proverb implies that having left whatever sound judgment she once had, the woman has transformed herself into a boorish animal in her dress, speech and behavior. In fact, she is worse than a pig. The sow by nature is boorish; the woman ‘turned aside’ from her dignity. The beauty which should have enhanced her now appears foolishly wasted. Instead of being honored by her natural gift, she finds ridicule.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 11:22).<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy because Jesus is holy</u>. Believers are the bride of Christ and should remain pure for Him (Rev. 19:7-9). He made you righteous at a terrible price (1 Cor. 6:20). Thus, you are called upon to make your life a living sacrifice for Him (Ro. 12:1). Jesus also wants you to be pure and holy for His use.  He wants you to be holy because He is holy (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-5; 19:2; 20:7).  Part of being pure and holy includes separating yourself from unclean things (Dt. 22:10; 2 Cor. 6:14).  “If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;”  (1 Jo. 1:6). </p></li>

<p>The righteous should seek to be holy and desire only what is good<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be pure in heart by desiring the things of the Spirit</u>. While the wicked desire evil things, those who are transformed through Jesus should desire what He desires. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath</em>.” (Prov. 11:23). “As we reflect on this verse, we recognize that it provides insight into the character traits and outcomes associated with righteousness and wickedness. The righteous aim to cultivate goodness in their lives and in the lives of those around them, while the wicked are embroiled in their selfish ambitions that ultimately lead to destruction. This repetition emphasizes that our thoughts and desires shape our realities, prompting us to strive for goodness in all aspects of our lives.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 11:23).<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous should desire the holy things of the Spirit and avoid the deeds of the flesh</u>. Those made righteous through Jesus should desire the things of the Spirit. “For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are in accord with the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.” (Ro. 8:5; Col. 3:2). Those who love the things of the world more than the things of the Spirit do not have the truth within them (1 Jo. 2:15). If you desire what Jesus wants, He will fulfill your desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4).</p></li>

<h2 id="generosity-the-righteous-are-generous-to-those-in-need.-prov.-1124-26."><strong>5. <u>Generosity: The Righteous Are Generous to Those in Need</u>. Prov. 11:24-26.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous generously share Jesus’ provision with those in need</u>. While the wicked withhold their God-given talents from those in need, those who are generous to others in need will be greatly blessed. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>There is one who scatters, and yet increases all the more,</em> a<em>nd there is one who withholds what is justly due, and yet it results only in poverty</em>.” (Prov. 11:24). “<strong>There is one who scatters, yet increases more</strong>: This refers to the generous man or woman who <strong>scatters</strong>, yet not in the sense of wasteful distribution. This is Biblical generosity, which is like the scattering of seed (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Corinthians+9.8-13&amp;t=NKJV">2 Corinthians 9:8-13</a>) that will later bring a great harvest (<strong>increases more</strong>). We never lose when we give generously unto God and His work. <strong>There is one who withholds more than is right</strong>: To be stingy and to hold on to <strong>more than is right</strong> is to lead <strong>to poverty</strong>. When we are selfish and ungenerous with what God has given us, we should expect that God would grant less to us – leading eventually <strong>to poverty</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 11:24).<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who follow in His righteousness by helping others</u>. Jesus will pour out His blessing when you have the faith to help others in need. “Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and put Me to the test now in this,” says the LORD of armies, “if I do not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.” (Mal 3:10). But those who sow sparingly will be blessed sparingly. “Now I say this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows generously will also reap generously.” (2 Cor. 9:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who share Jesus’ blessings will be blessed</u>. If generosity is the fruit of your faith, your faith will grow. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>A generous person will be prosperous, and one who gives others plenty of water will himself be given plenty</em>.” (Prov. 11:25). “So he that comes full fraught with the blessing of the Gospel of Christ to others is enriched with it himself, and becomes more and more flourishing in gifts and grace; and he that watereth shall be watered also himself; he that largely shares with others, like a flowing fountain of water, shall have an abundance communicated to him again from God, the inexhaustible fountain of mercies.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 11:25).<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The righteous find refreshment by being Jesus’ hands and feet to help others<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous find contentment in helping others in need</u>. God is pleased when you help others out of love for them. “And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.” (Heb. 13:16). “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine, you did it for Me.’” (Matt. 25:40). If you persevere in helping others, God will let you reap joy in doing so. “One who is gracious to a poor person lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” (Prov. 19:17). “A Psalm of David. Blessed is one who considers the helpless; the LORD will save him on a day of trouble.” (Ps. 41:1). “Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary. So then, while we have opportunity, let’s do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.” (Gal. 6:9-10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous do not withhold from those in need</u>. While a person can be cursed for hoarding and withholding from those in need, God blessed those who share their God-given resources. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>One who withholds grain, the people will curse him, but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it</em>.” (Prov. 11:26). “We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 11:26).<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who withhold from others in need exhibit a false righteousness</u>. The hypocrites who claim to be righteous can have no part of Jesus if they withhold from those who are in need. “For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’ Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You as a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’… Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’” (Matt. 25:35-39, 41-43).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>A righteous person trusts in imitating Jesus’ goodness over wealth</u>. In connection with Proverbs 11:28’s message about trusting Yahweh over wealth, Proverbs 11:27 reveals that Yahweh will reward those who trust in Him by doing good over pursuing wealth. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>One who diligently seeks good seeks favor,</em> <em>but one who seeks evil, evil will come to him</em>.” (Prov. 11:27). This verse from the Book of Proverbs is a timeless reminder about the consequences of our actions and intentions. It emphasizes the importance of seeking goodness and righteousness in all aspects of our lives. (God’s blessings.com).<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous trust in Jesus to provide</u>. Jesus will provide if you seek out and trust in His will for you. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31). “The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:10). “Jesus said to them, ‘I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.”’ (Jo. 6:35). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous trust in Jesus over wealth and flourish in His grace</u>. While those who trust in wealth will find that their money is unable to save them, those who place their trust in Yahweh will flourish. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>One who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like the green leaf</em>.” (Prov. 11:28). “To trust in riches is to trust in uncertain things; things not to be depended on, being here today and gone tomorrow; it is like leaning upon a broken staff, which giving way, the person falls: and so the fall of Babylon will be, while she is trusting in and boasting of her riches and grandeur, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm"><u>Revelation 18:7</u></a>; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch; that abides in the tree, is alive and green, full of leaves, and laden with fruit: so the righteous are as branches in Christ, and receive life and nourishment from him, and abide in him; and bring forth fruit and flourish, like palm trees and cedars, in the house of the Lord, and grow in every grace, and in the knowledge of Christ;” (John Gill on Prov. 11:28).<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> </p></li>

But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the faithfulness of God forever and ever.” (Ps. 52:7-8). “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD. For he will be like a tree planted by the water that extends its roots by a stream, and does not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought, nor cease to yield fruit.” (Jer. 17:7-8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous trust Jesus’ provision of family and Church order over their selfish desires</u>. Because of the importance of the family and the Church in raising people to follow Yahweh, Solomon warned against those who trust in their own desires and in so doing undermine Yahweh’s family and Church order. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>One who troubles his own house will inherit wind, and the foolish will be servant to the wise-hearted</em>.” (Prov. 11:29). “This verse presents a profound insight into human behavior, especially regarding how we treat our families and ourselves. The first part mentions someone who causes trouble in their own home. It tells us that this person will inherit the wind. In a sense, this means that instead of gaining something valuable, they will receive nothing, just emptiness. When we think about it, causing conflict in our own families or relationships can lead us to lose the things we hold dear.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 11:29).<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous uphold family, church, and other godly relationships</u>. Jesus warns that chaos will ensue when we undermine His intended order. “And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, ‘Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and no city or house divided against itself will stand.”’ (Matt. 12:25). Instead of pursuing selfish desires, the righteous provide for and uplift Jesus’ intended family and church relationships. “But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.” (1 Tim. 5:8).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evangelism-the-righteous-seek-to-win-souls-for-jesus.-prov.-1130-31."><strong>7. <u>Evangelism: The Righteous Seek to Win Souls for Jesus</u>. Prov. 11:30-31.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous win souls for Jesus</u>. The righteous produce fruit from their faith. This includes winning souls for Jesus. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and one who is wise gains souls</em>.” (Prov. 11:30). “The righteous, by the performance of his duty to his neighbors, brings, as it were, life and healing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm"><u>Revelation 22:2</u></a>) to them, and ‘the wise man winneth souls,’ attracts them to himself, and induces them to follow his example.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 11:30).<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless the righteous who evangelize the lost</u>. Jesus’ Great Commission includes winning souls for Him (Matt. 28:19-20). The righteous should respond to His call. When they do so, they will be blessed for doing so. “let him know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.” (Jam. 5:20). “But how are they to preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written: ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!”’ (Ro. 10:15). “Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.” (2 Cor. 5:20).</p></li>

<p>The righteous seek to save souls by leading them to Jesus<a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Each person will either reap the fruit of righteousness or the deeds of the flesh</u>. Proverbs 11 concludes with a warning. If Jesus disciplines even the righteous to correct them, how much greater will the consequences be for those who reject Him and His righteousness. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>If the righteous will be repaid on the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner</em>!” (Prov. 11:31). “[I]f even the righteous shall be punished for their trespasses, as Moses, David, etc., how much more the wicked!” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 11:31).<a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The wise accept Jesus and cling to His righteousness</u>. Peter quotes Proverbs 11:31 to warn against rejecting Jesus and His righteousness. “For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved, what will become of the godless man and the sinner?” (1 Pet. 4:17-18).</p></li>
