<p><u>Introduction</u>: After Jehoshaphat strayed in his walk with God, God showed mercy and grace in saving him and convicting him of his sins. Jehoshaphat responded in humility by accepting God’s loving rebuke and transforming himself and his people. From Jehoshaphat’s response to God’s rebuke, God reveals seven things that He desires from you. These include: (1) gratitude, (2) repentance, (3) transformation, (4) justice, (5) obedience, (6) submission, and (7) faith.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, out of mercy and grace, God spared Jehoshaphat from the death that he deserved. Every believer in Christ has also received mercy and grace in being spared from death. In response, God desires your gratitude for His mercy and grace. <u>Second</u>, God sent a prophet to convict Jehoshaphat of his sins. Today, God sends the Holy Spirit to convict you of your sins. God desires that you repent when the Holy Spirit convicts you of sin. <u>Third</u>, Jehoshaphat responded to his rebuke by leading his people back to God as a transformed nation. God also desires that you leave your old sins behind and live for Him as a new creation. <u>Fourth</u>, Jehoshaphat appointed judges to serve as God’s source of justice throughout Judah. God also desires that you be His source of justice in the world. <u>Fifth</u>, Jehoshaphat gave instructions for the judges to faithfully apply God’s law in resolving all disputes. God also desires your obedience in living according to His Word. <u>Sixth</u>, Jehoshaphat appointed leaders to guide the judges and to ensure accountability. God also desires that you submit to Him through His appointed leaders. <u>Finally</u>, Jehoshaphat encouraged the people to boldly step out and serve God. He encouraged them by promising that God would be with them when they did. God also wants you to show your faith by boldly stepping forward to serve Him. When you do, God will also be there to uplift you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s mercy and grace in sparing Jehoshaphat from Ahab’s fate</u>. Although God judged Ahab for his disobedience in refusing to listen to God’s prophet before starting a war with the Assyrians, God spared Jehoshaphat from death or even injury: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:1). Jehoshaphat received God’s mercy and grace after four incredibly foolish acts. First, without consulting God, he formed a marriage alliance with the most evil king to ever rule Northern Israel, Ahab (2 Chr. 18:1). Second, also without consulting God, he formed a military alliance with Northern Israel against Assyria (2 Chr. 18:1-3; 1 Kgs. 22:1-4). Third, God’s prophet Micaiah warned both Ahab and Jehoshaphat against going to war with the Assyrians (2 Chr. 18:12-16; 1 Kgs. 22:13-17). Yet, instead of listening to God’s prophet, Jehoshaphat listed to Ahab’s 400 false prophets of the pagan god of Asherah, who all incorrectly predicted victory (2 Chr. 18:5-11; 1 Kgs. 22:6-12). Fourth, he said nothing after a false prophet struck Micaiah, and Ahab threw him into prison, where he was tortured (2 Chr. 18:23-27; 1 Kgs. 22:24-28). Because Ahab was disobedient, he died in battle, just as Micaiah had foretold (2 Chr. 18:33-34). Yet, God showed mercy and grace to Jehoshaphat because he cried out to Him: “<sup>31 </sup>So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, ‘It is the king of Israel,’ and they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> helped him, and God diverted them from him. <sup>32 </sup>When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.” (2 Chr. 18:31-32). Only through God’s mercy and grace did Jehoshaphat escape that the death that he deserved.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Judah also suffered long-term harm from Jehoshaphat’s marriage alliance with Ahab</u>. Jehoshaphat’s rebellion against God had lasting consequences for all of Judah. Jehoshaphat gave his son Jehoram to the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah (2 Ch. 18:1). This allowed Jezebel to introduce her Baal worship directly into the royal line of King David in Judah. As a result of this unholy union, Jehoram “walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab did (for Ahab’s daughter was his wife), and he did evil in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (2 Chr. 21:6). This in turn caused Jehoram’s son to also suffer from idolatry (2 Chr. 22:2-4). As his heirs turned from God, this also caused all of the people of Judah to suffer. Despite having his life spared, Jehoshaphat did not call off the wedding alliance. Again, he did nothing to earn God’s mercy and grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews had no reason to boast about their status</u>. All of the kings and the people sinned before God. None deserved His mercy and grace. Before giving the Jews the Promised Land, Moses reminded them that they did not deserve the honor that God gave them: “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples, but because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.” (Dt. 7:7-8). The Jews did not have any reason to boast about being God’s select people. They also were not a virtuous nation of people. Like every other person, they had to see their need for mercy and grace to serve God with humility.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be grateful and don’t take pride in what God has done in your life</u>. Every good and perfect thing that you have also came from God (Jam. 1:17). Your acts of righteousness are but filthy rags before Him (Is. 64:6). All have sinned before Him (Ro. 3:23; 1 Pet. 2:22; Ps. 14:3). If your righteousness came through keeping the law or your good works, then Jesus’ death was unnecessary (Gal. 2:21). God wants to show you mercy and grace so that you can serve Him. Yet, He cannot use you if you are filled with pride: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18; 18:12; 11:2; 29:23). Jehoshaphat later praised God for His mercy and grace. “When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who sang to the LORD and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out before the army and said, ‘Give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness is everlasting.”’ (2 Chr. 20:21). When God blesses you with His mercy and grace, are you grateful and giving Him the praise?</p></li>

<h2 id="repentance-god-desires-that-you-repent-when-he-convicts-you-of-sin.-2-chr.-192-3.">2. <u>Repentance: God Desires that You Repent When He Convicts You of Sin</u>. 2 Chr. 19:2-3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God rebuked Jehoshaphat for his actions</u>. Although God spared Jehoshaphat’s life, God used the prophet Jehu to rebuke him for his marriage and military alliance with Ahab: “<em><sup>2 </sup>Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, ‘Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and so bring wrath on yourself from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? <sup>3 </sup>But there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God</em>.’” (2 Chr. 19:2-3). In addition to this rebuke, God also rebuked Jehoshaphat in other ways. Jehoshaphat later sought to be like Solomon by building up a fleet to build up his wealth (1 Kgs. 9:26-28). He used the conquered territory from Ezion-geber in Edom as a naval base (1 Kgs. 22:46-48). David previously conquered Edom and set up military bases there (2 Sam. 8:14). Jehoshaphat later tried to build up his fleet through an alliance with Ahab’s son Ahaziah, who became the King of Northern Israel during the 17<sup>th</sup> year of his reign in Judah. Yet, as a sign of his separate judgment, Ahaziah only reigned two years, 853-852 B.C. (2 Kgs. 22:51). Like Ahab, Ahaziah did evil in God’s eyes by leading his people astray through the worship of the pagan god Baal (1 Kgs. 22:52-53). Jezebel, Ahaziah’s mother, survived Ahab’s death and continued her wicked influence through her son. Ahaziah’s short reign was also a fulfillment of God’s judgment upon Ahab’s household (1 Kgs. 21:29). Both Ahaziah and Jezebel would die brutal deaths. After the prophet Jehu’s rebuke, God sent a third prophet named Eliezer to condemn Jehoshaphat for committing an act of evil by continuing to join with the evil kings of Northern Israel: “After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted wickedly in so doing.” (2 Chr. 20:35). As yet another warning, God then destroyed Jehoshaphat’s fleet before they ever left the port (2 Chr. 20:36-37). Jehoshaphat then wisely rejected another joint proposal that Ahaziah made to him (1 Kgs. 22:49). Thus, Jehoshaphat’s rebuke did not result in a long-term change in his behavior. Again, God allowed him to stay on the throne only out of His mercy and grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Love God by hating evil</u>. The prophet Jehu accused Jehoshaphat of claiming to love God when also loving evil: ‘“<em>Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and so bring wrath on yourself from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?</em>”’ (2 Chr. 19:2). You can show your love for God by hating evil: “Hate evil, you who love the LORD, who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 97:10). Hating evil is also the very definition of fearing God: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). Do you tolerate evil things in your life? If so, your love for God will be corrupted.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Encourage those whom you may have to rebuke</u>. The prophet Jehu previously rebuked King Baasha of Northern Israel before he was deposed (1 Kgs. 16:1). Baasha, however, refused to repent. To encourage Jehoshaphat to repent, Jehu included with his rebuke praise for the fact that Jehoshaphat previously removed pagan idols from Judah and for setting his heart to seek God’s will: “<em><sup>3 </sup>But there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have set your heart to seek God</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:3). Believers are also called upon to encourage others: “Therefore <em>encourage one another and build up one another</em>, just as you also are doing.” (1 Thess. 5:11). “not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but <em>encouraging one another</em>; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:25). Are you encouraging anyone who is struggling to break free from sin and return to God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent when the Holy Spirit convicts you of sin</u>. The prophet Jehu acted under the direction of the Holy Spirit in convicting Jehoshaphat of his sins. His goal in his gentle rebuke was to elicit Jehoshaphat’s repentance. When the Holy Spirit convicts you of sin, God also wants you to confess your sins and repent. “Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;” (Acts. 3:19). “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”’ (Acts 2:38). Is there any sin that you need to confess?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transformation-god-desires-that-you-live-for-him-as-a-new-creation.-2-chr.-194.">3. <u>Transformation: God Desires That You Live for Him as a New Creation</u>. 2 Chr. 19:4.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehoshaphat accepts God’s rebuke and seeks to bring the nation back to God</u>. Although Jehoshaphat was a flawed leader, he was not evil in his intentions. Thus, he humbly accepted his rebuke and sought to restore the nation of Judah on its walk with God: “<sup>4 </sup><em>So Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem and went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:4). Jehoshaphat had learned an important lesson not to travel to Northern Israel or other places where he might be influenced by worldly things. In addition, he realized that his death would bring chaos and disorder to Judah. More importantly, at that moment, he showed remorse for his actions by seeking to bring all of Judah “<em>back to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:4). The text also implies his repentance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God exalts those who humble themselves before Him</u>. God will humble rulers like Jehoshaphat before He will exalt them: “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, and has exalted those who were humble.” (Lk. 1:52). God will also humble you before He exalts you: “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:10). “So that He sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.” (Job 5:11). God will also heal a nation when it humbles itself: “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chr. 7:14). Are you praying for your leaders and nation to repent?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be transformed and live as a new creation</u>. God had freed the Jews from bondage to sin. Yet, they kept returning to their old ways. At this moment, Jehoshaphat led the people to leave their sinful ways behind and live as the people meant for them to be. “Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.” (Ezek. 36:26). Believers should also live as new creations and have no part of their old ways. “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Chr. 5:17). “Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Ro. 6:4). Are living as a transformed believer? Or, are you returning to your old sinful ways?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehoshaphat initiates further reforms to keep the nation on the right path</u>. In addition to leading the nation in repenting, Jehoshaphat appointed judges to ensure that the people resolved disputes and governed themselves according to God’s Word: “<sup>5 </sup><em>He appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city. <sup>6 </sup>He said to the judges, ‘Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> who is with you when you render judgment. <sup>7 </sup>Now then let the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be upon you; be very careful what you do, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe</em>.’ <sup>8 </sup><em>In Jerusalem also Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests, and some of the heads of the fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgment of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and to judge disputes among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <sup>9 </sup>Then he charged them saying, ‘Thus you shall do in the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, faithfully and wholeheartedly</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:5-9). Jehoshaphat reminded the judges that they were “<em>not judge[s] for man but for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> who is with you when you render judgment.</em>” (2 Chr. 19:5). Thus, they needed to act with the highest level of integrity because their actions (whether good or bad) reflected upon God. This warning applies to believers as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The appointment of judges for those who lived outside of Jerusalem</u>. Jehoshaphat appointed separate judges for those who lived outside of Jerusalem and those who lived within it. God’s Temple was a place where people could bring their disputes for His leaders to resolve. The Levite priests resolved disputes that people brought to the Temple (1 Chr. 23:4; Dt. 17:9). Yet, because God did not want justice denied or delayed, He ordered that judges be appointed in each town to resolve disputes as needed: <sup>18 </sup>“You shall appoint for yourself judges and officers in all your towns which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. <sup>19 </sup>You shall not distort justice; you shall not be partial, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous. <sup>20 </sup>Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue, that you may live and possess the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.” (Dt. 16:18-20; 1 Chr. 26:31-32).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a source of God’s justice in the world</u>. God also wants believers to be concerned about injustice in the world. “The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.” (Prov. 31:9). “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.” (Ps. 82:3). “[D]o justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.” (Mic. 6:8). “[L]earn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, and plead for the widow.” (Is. 1:17). “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.” (Dt. 10:18). You are God’s “salt and light” (Matt. 5:13-16). Salt is an irritant to an open wound. If sin is around you and if your life has been transformed for God, you should be an irritant to sin. Are you advocating for those in need and opposing sin?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy and be consecrated for God at all times</u>. God also calls upon every believer to follow the example of the judges and the Levities when they walked in holiness and righteousness: “you . . . are being built into a spiritual house to be a <em>holy priesthood</em> . . .” (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). As part of God’s nation of priests, you are meant to be a light to the lost: “You are the light of the world.” (Matt. 5:14(a)). To be a light, however, you must be holy: “‘Be holy, because I am holy.’” (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44; 19:2; Ex. 22:31). “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Cor. 7:1). “Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48; Jam. 4:17). Are you living a holy lifestyle and serving as a beacon of light to others?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be impartial regardless of a person’s wealth, status, race, origin, or gender</u>. Jehoshaphat warned: “<em><sup>7 </sup>Now then let the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be upon you; be very careful what you do, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God will have no part in unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe</em>.’” (2 Chr. 19:7). God wanted His people to have integrity in their dealings with each other the same way He was and is with them (Dt. 10:17). He does not show partiality in judging sin (1 Pet. 1:17-19). Believers are also warned not to favor people based upon their status, wealth, race, or gender: “You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.” (Lev. 19:15). Do you give preference to those who look like you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>As Jesus’ ambassador, walk with righteousness and integrity</u>. Jehoshaphat also warned against those who might seek or accept bribes (2 Chr. 19:7). A believer must also never accept a bribe: “You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just.” (Ex. 23:8). “You shall not distort justice; you shall not be partial, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.” (Dt. 16:19). You are also Jesus’ ambassador (2 Cor. 5:22). You further represent His light (Matt. 5:14). Thus, He calls upon you to be blameless and righteous: “so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ; having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” (Phil. 1:11). Do your actions reflect fairly upon Jesus’ righteousness?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="obedience-god-desires-your-obedience-in-living-according-to-his-word.-2-chr.-1910.">5. <u>Obedience: God Desires Your Obedience in Living According to His Word</u>. 2 Chr. 19:10.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehoshaphat provides instructions for the judges to ensure the people’s righteousness</u>. Jehoshaphat advised the judges to use God’s Word for resolving disputes and for them to encourage the people to use God’s Word to guide their actions: “<sup>10 </sup><em>Whenever any dispute comes to you from your brethren who live in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them so that they may not be guilty before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and wrath may not come on you and your brethren. Thus you shall do and you will not be guilty</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:10). God’s Word was light to guide the path of His people (Ps. 119:105). The judges and priests helped to apply God Word to their lives. If the judge or priest faced a circumstances where God’s Word was silent, the priests and leaders sought out God’s will through rocks called Urim and Thummim (Lev. 8:8; Ex. 28:30; Nu. 27:21). Today, when God’s Word on a subject is not clear, He has given us the Spirit to discern His will (Jo. 16:7; 13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God requires obedience to His laws</u>. Divine justice is not possible if a person refuses to obey God’s law. Thus, the Levites were required to teach God’s law to others. Those who decided to do what was right in their own eyes would be guilty of the sin of presumption: “<sup>11 </sup>According to the terms of the law which they teach you, and according to the verdict which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the word which they declare to you, to the right or the left. <sup>12 </sup>The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, nor to the judge, that man shall die; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel. <sup>13 </sup>Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again.” (Dt. 17:11-13). Obedience was a command that Moses gave frequently (Dt. 6:3-4; 9:1; 20:3). Moses knew the purpose behind a particular law might not always appear clear to a believer. God requires obedience even if you do not understand. We should consider the Law to be like a treasure: “I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all riches.” (Ps. 119:14). Jesus said, if we love Him, we will keep His commandments: “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6). His “disciples” were the “disciplined ones” in keeping His commandments. As bondservants or freed slaves, they were obedient out of love, not obligation. Whether you follow the law out of love instead of obligation is a test for whether you really know God: “By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.” (1 Jo. 2:3). “[W]hat matters is the keeping of the commandments of God.” (1 Cor. 7:19). Obedience is a foundation upon which the covenant stands. Are you obedient to only the parts of God’s Law that you agree with?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be compassionate and loving to others</u>. The priests were further required to teach the application with love so that the people would love each other: “Thus has the LORD of hosts said, ‘Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;”’ (Zech. 7:9). “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (Jo. 13:34). When others are suffering, do you make time in your busy schedule to show them love and compassion?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-god-desires-that-you-submit-to-him-through-his-leaders.-2-chr.-1911a.">6. <u>Submission: God Desires that You Submit to Him Through His Leaders</u>. 2 Chr. 19:11(a).</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehoshaphat appoints leaders to guide the judges</u>. To ensure that the judges followed God’s Word and remained accountable, Jehoshaphat also appointed leaders to guide them. “<sup>11 </sup><em>Behold, Amariah the chief priest will be over you in all that pertains to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. Also the Levites shall be officers before you</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:11(a)). This followed a leadership pattern that David implemented prior to his death. David is estimated to have appointed 6,000 Levities who served as judges for disputes throughout the Jewish territories. These men all acted: “for all the work of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and the service of the king.” (1 Chr. 26:30, 32). With only two tribes left, the number of judges would have been far smaller. Yet, each judge still needed to be accountable to a godly leader.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submit to God’s appointed leaders</u>. God also commands that believers submit to His appointed leaders. First, believers submit to Him through the Holy Spirit (Ro. 8:14), His Word (2 Tim. 3:16), and His Church leadership (Matt. 18:17-20, Heb. 13:17). Second, believers should submit to civil authorities (1 Pet. 2:13-14; Ro. 13:1-2). Third, believers should submit to God’s family order (Eph. 5:22-25; 6:10). Only when your authorities refuse to follow God’s Word can you ignore them (Acts. 4:19). Satan’s goal has always been to break down authority through rebellion. His goal is to create chaos and misery. Satan first led a third of the angels in rebellion against God’s rule (Rev. 12:3-9). He then led Eve to rebel against God’s rules (Gen. 3:1-4). He then led Adam and Eve to rebel against each other (Gen. 3:16). All of Satan’s rebellions in the wilderness sought to depose Moses as the leader of the Jews. Jesus once quoted a prophesy: “I will strike down the shepherd, <em>and the sheep shall be scattered.”</em> (Mk. 14:23). Upon His arrest, the disciples scattered. When the nation of Israel rebelled against God, it fought with itself and divided into two separate nations. Satan also tries to have people bring down their church, civic leaders, and family leaders through rebellion. Society has reaped chaos from its rebellions. Are you submitting to God’s appointed leaders?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Select leaders who will obey God’s Word</u>. Because every believer is expected to obey God’s appointed leaders, it is important for believers to select or elect leaders who will obey God’s Word and His Spirit. Are you voting for God-fearing leaders? Does your church speak out when leaders ignore God’s Word in governing the people?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be accountable for your actions</u>. Like the judges and the Levites, God wants believers to be transparent and accountable to each other to ensure that members of the Body of Christ stay strong in the face of temptation. Believers are commanded to “<em>shepherd the flock of God among you,</em> <em>exercising oversight</em> not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;” (1 Pet. 5:2). “Jesus said to him, ‘Tend My sheep.’” (Jo. 21:17). “<em>Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers,</em> to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.” (Acts 20:28). “Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding.” (Jer. 3:15). “Know well the condition of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds;” (Prov. 27:23). “and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.” (Eph. 5:21). “You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; . . .” (1 Pet. 5:5). Are you accountable for your actions to anyone at your church?</p></li>

<li><p><u>Jehoshaphat encourages the people to have the faith to boldly serve</u>. Jehoshaphat concluded by encouraging the people to act boldly in serving God. “<em>Act resolutely, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be with the upright</em>.” (2 Chr. 19:11(b)). If the people had the faith to step out in obedience, God would be with them. The same promise applies to believers today.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God rewards those who act with faith-led obedience</u>. David promised Solomon that God would be with Him and that Solomon would succeed in all his endeavors if he followed God’s law: “Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,” (1 Kgs. 2:3). When he dedicated the Temple, Solomon gave a similar promise to the people that they would prosper if they followed God’s law: “Then you will prosper, if you are careful to observe the statutes and the ordinances which the LORD commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous, do not fear nor be dismayed.” (1 Chr. 22:13). You cannot earn your salvation. Yet, God can still reward you in other ways when you act with faith-led obedience. Some rewards might not be realized until you get to heaven. Other rewards may come in the form of answered prayers. Are you acting boldly while faithfully serving God to give Him the opportunity to reward you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be resolute in your faith to boldly serve God</u>. The Lord is the only thing that you are to fear (Prov. 1:7). And the fear of the Lord is defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:13). If you fear anything other than God your faith is lacking. Although David was the smallest man in his family, he feared no evil or any enemy because he had faith that God was fighting for him. “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread?. . .” (Ps. 27:1-3). “I fear no evil, for you are with me.” (Ps. 23:4; 112:7). “Say to the anxious heart, ‘take courage, fear not.” (Is. 34:4). Without faith, you are of no use in God’s army. It will also be “impossible” to please Him (Heb. 11:6). With boldness in your faith, are you stepping out to serve God?</p></li>
