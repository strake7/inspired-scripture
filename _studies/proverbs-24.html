<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 24 concludes the “Thirty Sayings of the Wise”, which began at Proverbs 22:17. Proverbs 24 contains the final 10 of these 30 sayings. In addition, Proverbs 24:23 notes the beginning of a post-script with five additional “<em>sayings of the wise</em>.” These sayings borrow from an Egyptian style of logic to show that the substance of Yahweh’s wisdom is superior to any worldly wisdom (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 24).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Here, Solomon reveals seven lessons for living out Jesus’ wisdom in the world. These include: (1) separation, (2) faith, (3) perseverance, (4) love, (5) obedience, (6) diligence, and (7) being Spirit-led.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one and two (Saying 20), Solomon warned believers against envying evil people or seeking their company. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He desires that you separate yourself from the evils of the world. <u>Second</u>, in verses three through nine (Sayings 21 through 24), Solomon offered examples regarding how believers should trust and believe in God’s wisdom. Without faith, it is impossible to fully live out the wisdom that Jesus offers. <u>Third</u>, in verses 10 through 16 (Sayings 25 through 27), Solomon provided different examples to illustrate how believers must persevere in their walk through God’s wisdom. Jesus offers the wisdom and strength that will allow you to persevere in your faith. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 17 through 20 (Sayings 28 and 29), Solomon urged believers to avoid rejoicing in the downfall of sinners or envying their temporary successes. Jesus also wants you to live out His wisdom by loving Him and showing love for the lost. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 21 through 25 (Saying 30 and Further Sayings One), Solomon urged believers to serve in obedience. Jesus also wants you to live out His wisdom with obedience. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 26 through 27 (Further Sayings Two and Three), Solomon urged believers to be diligent in serving God. Jesus also wants you to live out His wisdom with diligence. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 28 through 34 (Further Sayings Four and Five), Solomon urged believers to only offer testimony against another with a proper reason and to avoid slothfulness wherever God places you for service. Jesus also wants you to live out His wisdom by following the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Among other things, this includes letting Him direct your words and your service.</p>

Prov. 24:1-2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Do not envy evil people or seek their company</u>. Because of the false allure that successful sinful people can create, Solomon warned believers against being envious of successful evil people or any desire to seek out their company. (Saying 20). “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Do not be envious of evil people, nor desire to be with them; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>for their minds plot violence, and their lips talk of trouble</em>.” (Prov. 24:1-2). “The proneness of good men, especially while they are weak, and only in the beginnings of their course of piety and virtue, to be dejected at the prosperity of the ungodly, and so to be tempted to imitate them, is the reason that the admonition which we here meet with is so often repeated; <em>neither desire to be with them — </em>Desire not their company, nor to imitate their manner of life. <em>For their heart studieth destruction — </em>How they may oppress and destroy others, which yet, at last, fails upon their own heads.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Prov. 24:1-2).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<p>To live out Jesus’ wisdom, separate yourself from evil influences<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The love of worldly evil is hostility toward Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned against envying those who commit evil. “Do not envy a violent person, and do not choose any of his ways.” (Prov. 3:31). “Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of the LORD always.” (Prov. 23:17). David also warned against envying the fleeting allure of evildoers. “A Psalm of David. Do not get upset because of evildoers, do not be envious of wrongdoers. For they will wither quickly like the grass, and decay like the green plants.” (Ps. 37:1-2). Paul also warned that seeking out the company of evil people can corrupt good morals. “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.”’ (1 Cor. 15:33). If you desire to be like successful evil people or seek out their company to get ahead, Jesus’ love is not within you. “You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” (Jam. 4:4). “Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.” (1 Jo. 2:15-16).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers a house built upon His wisdom that will protect you and bless you</u>. In contrast to the fleeting success of evil, Jesus offers a house built upon His wisdom that will endure and allow you to live a blessed life (Saying 21). “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>and by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches</em>.” (Prov. 24:3-4). “A family is built up, furnished and supplied with the necessaries and conveniences of life, and brought into flourishing and prosperous circumstances, by wise and prudent management, by diligence and industry, through the blessing of God upon them, without taking such methods as evil men do. The house of God, the church of the living God, is built by Wisdom, that is, by Christ; on a good foundation, a rock, upon himself, against which the gates of hell can never prevail; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm"><u>Proverbs 9:1</u></a>. Every good man's house, himself, his soul, and the eternal salvation of it, are built on the same; and he is a wise man that builds his house through wisdom; that builds on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, the one and only foundation which God has laid, which is Jesus Christ;” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 24:3-4).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Let the wisdom of the cross be the foundation of your house<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Search out and follow Jesus’ wisdom to enjoy His protections and blessings</u>. A house built upon God’s wisdom is complete, represented by its seven pillars. “Wisdom has built her house, she has carved out her seven pillars;” (Prov. 9:1). God’s wisdom will protect you and your household when followed. “For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom keeps its possessors alive.” (Ecc. 7:12). This wisdom comes from Jesus. “but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” (1 Cor. 1:24). He is building a house through His Church that all believers can be a part of through faith. “but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the boast of our hope.” (Heb. 3:6). He offers you a spiritual house. “you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 2:5). As a house built on a perfect foundation, Jesus offers protections in His Church that will allow you to endure the storms of life. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers you the wisdom and power to succeed in doing His will</u>. In the face of the enemy’s spiritual warfare attacks, Jesus offers to empower you to accomplish His desires for you. But you must search out His wisdom through the counsel of His Word, the Holy Spirit and godly believers (Saying 22). “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A wise man is strong, and a person of knowledge increases power. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For by wise guidance you will wage war, and in an abundance of counselors there is victory</em>.” (Prov. 24:5-6). “A common expression in English is the advice to ‘work smarter, not harder.’ In part, this means a person can accomplish much more through wisdom and careful thinking, as compared to just brute force or effort. A person well-established in truth and wisdom (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/2/Proverbs-2-1.html"><u>Proverbs 2:1–13</u></a>) is better equipped to make decisions (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-21.html"><u>Proverbs 3:21–23</u></a>). Likewise, the one who pools the wisdom of many people is more likely to find a workable solution to their problem (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-22.html"><u>Proverbs 15:22</u></a>).” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 25:6).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> “The Christian life is full of battles as spiritual warfare rages. We learn from <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-12.html"><u>Ephesians 6:12</u></a> that ‘we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.’ <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/5/1-Peter-5-8.html"><u>First Peter 5:8</u></a> tells us to ‘be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.’ Fortunately, no Christian is alone in this warfare. Christ, the ‘Wonderful Counselor’ (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-6.html"><u>Isaiah 9:6</u></a>) is always with each believer, and the Holy Spirit, ‘another Helper,’ is alongside (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-16.html"><u>John 14:16</u></a>). Furthermore, the Lord has placed in the church teaching pastors to help build us up in the faith (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/4/Ephesians-4-11.html"><u>Ephesians 4:11–12</u></a>). He has also given His Word as a sword to use in battling the devil (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/6/Ephesians-6-17.html"><u>Ephesians 6:17</u></a>). With all this available counsel victory is certain.” (<em>Id</em>. at Prov. 24:6).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ powerful wisdom is freely available through His Word, prayer, and godly counsel</u>. Jesus’ wisdom offers you the strength to endure trials. “Wisdom strengthens a wise person more than ten rulers who are in a city.” (Ecc. 7:19). “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.” (Eph. 1:17; Col. 1:9). His wisdom is better than any physical weapon in your spiritual warfare battles. “Wisdom is better than weapons of war, ...” (Ecc. 9:18a). “A wise person scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.” (Prov. 21:22). Solomon received great wisdom when he prayed for it to be a wise ruler (1 Kgs. 3:9-12). Jesus’ wisdom is also freely available when you read the Word and pray for the Holy Spirit to guide you. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5; Matt. 7:7-8). In addition, He desires that you search out His wisdom through godly counsel and then pray about it and test it against the Word to make sure that it is accurate. “Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is victory.” (Prov. 11:14). “Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with many counselors they succeed.” (Prov. 15:22; 20:18). His wisdom will set your paths straight when you trust Him over your understandings. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.” (Prov. 3:5-6).</p></li>

<p>Let the wisdom that Jesus offers strengthen you<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who embrace worldly wisdom cannot understand the wisdom that Jesus offers</u>. While Jesus freely offers His wisdom, those who are spiritually blinded by the wisdom of the world cannot understand its true value (Saying 23). “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Wisdom is too exalted for a fool, he does not open his mouth at the gate</em>.” (Prov. 24:7). “Of a weak man: <em>Wisdom is too high</em> for him; he thinks it so, and therefore, despairing to attain it, he will take no pains in the pursuit of it, but sit down content without it. And really it is so; he has not capacity for it, and therefore the advantages he has for getting it are all in vain to him … And, for want of it, they are unfit for the service of their country: They <em>open not their mouth in the gate;</em> they are not admitted into the council or magistracy, or, if they are, they are dumb statues, and stand for cyphers; they say nothing, because they have nothing to say, and they know that if they should offer any thing it would not be heeded, nay, it would be hissed at. Let young men take pains to get wisdom, that they may be qualified for public business, and do it with reputation.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 24:7).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-24/media/image10.jpg" style="width:6.02483in;height:4.17331in" alt="Proverbs 24:7 KJV Bible Verse Image" /></p>
<p>Jesus’ wisdom is beyond the understanding of people without faith<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Fools reject the wisdom Jesus offers</u>. Even though Jesus cries out to sinners through His Word and the Holy Spirit, many are spiritually blind and consider His message to be foolish. “Wisdom shouts in the street, she raises her voice in the public square; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the gates in the city she declares her sayings: How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking? And how long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing and fools hate knowledge?” (Prov. 1:20-22). “A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge is easy for one who has understanding.” (Prov. 14:6). “For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Cor. 1:18). Only those with a childlike faith will understand His Wisdom. “At that time Jesus said, ‘I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants.”’ (Matt. 11:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who reject His calls to repent and embrace evil</u>. The scoffer who embraces evil and rejects the wisdom of repentance will face judgment (Saying 24). “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>One who plans to do evil, people will call a schemer. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The devising of foolishness is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to humanity</em>.” (Prov. 24:8-9). “The man that chooses the ways of sin is a marked man, and will be called names that are undesirable. They will not hold any respect among the people.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 24:8-9).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Capture and rebuke evil thoughts you have in Jesus’ name or you will act upon them</u>. Because of original sin, every person struggles with evil desires in their hearts (Gen. 6:5; Jer. 17:9; Ps. 51:5). Believers must first recognize their sinful nature (Ecc. 7:20; Rom. 3:23; 1 Jo. 1:8). Believers must then capture and rebuke their evil thoughts in the power of Jesus’ name (2 Cor. 10:5). Those who fail to repent of their evil thoughts will eventually act upon the evil that their hearts devise. “A heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil,” (Prov. 6:18). “He plans wickedness on his bed; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he does not reject evil.” (Ps. 36:4). “For from within, out of the hearts of people, come the evil thoughts, acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders, acts of adultery, deeds of greed, wickedness, deceit, indecent behavior, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.” (Mk. 7:21-22). Those who pursue evil without repenting will eventually face Jesus’ discipline or judgment. “Woe to those who devise wrongdoing, who practice evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, because it is in the power of their hands.” (Micah 2:1; Is. 32:6). “Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:15). “… destruction and misery are in their paths,” (Ro. 3:16; Gal. 5:19-21).</p></li>

Prov. 24:10-16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Even when you are facing your own trials, use Jesus’ wisdom to help save the lost</u>. Jesus warns that His disciples will face tribulations in the world (Jo. 16:33). But if in the face of your trials you find courage of faith to help others come to know Jesus, He will reward you for your faith. (Saying 25). “<em><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>If you show yourself lacking courage on the day of distress, your strength is meager. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Rescue those who are being taken away to death, and those who are staggering to the slaughter, oh hold them back! <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If you say, ‘See, we did not know this,’ does He who weighs the hearts not consider it? and does He who watches over your soul not know it? And will He not repay a person according to his work?</em>” (Prov. 24:10-12). “The catchword ‘strength’ links this saying with saying 22 (vv. 5-6). The strength derived from inspired wisdom is needed especially in crises. If fortified strength signals a person’s wisdom (v. 5), then meager strength in crisis signifies the lack or loss of wisdom (vv. 10-12). The saying is connected with saying 23 (v. 7) and 24 (vv. 8-9), which pertain to antisocial behavior, warning youth against complicity with them by passivity. The saying is unified by specifying ‘the time of crisis’ (v. 10) as when people are ’being taken to death’ (v. 11). It also specifies ‘if you show yourself lax’ (v. 10) as self-talk that excuses oneself from helping in the crisis (v. 12) … In sum, the omnicompetent Sovereign will act justly, unlike the passive coward. If the son turns away from helping victims, <em>I AM,</em> who protects their lives, will turn away from helping him.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 24:10-12).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>To live out Jesus’ wisdom, persevere in your faith<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus rewards those with the courage during your trial to share His wisdom with the lost</u>. In the face of life’s expected trials, find joy in knowing that Jesus is building your faith (Jam. 1:2-3). He offers to strengthen you in your weakness to serve Him (2 Cor. 12:9). With the strength that He offers you during your trials, He wants you to use the wisdom He offers to help save the lost. (Matt. 28:18-20). He will remember those who withhold the wisdom of salvation from sinners. “When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way so that he may live, that wicked person shall die for wrongdoing, but his blood I will require from your hand. However if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die for wrongdoing, but you have saved yourself.” (Ezek. 3:18-19). If you rise above your own trials to help save the lost, you will cover a multitude of your sins. “My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you strays from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.” (Jam. 5:19-20). When you rise above your own trials to save others in need, Jesus will also reward you. “who will repay each person according to his deeds: to those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life;” (Rom. 2:6-7). “Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.” (Gal. 6:9). “Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to reward each one as his work deserves.” (Rev. 22:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom offers eternal life, and it will forever sustain you</u>. Those who consume and internalize Jesus’ wisdom will find the sweet reward of eternal life (Saying 26). “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>My son, eat honey, for it is good; yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>know that wisdom is the same for your soul; if you find it, then there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off</em>.” (Prov. 24:13-14). “Eating <strong>honey</strong> is rewarded by the sweetness of the taste. It is easy to understand the reward of <strong>the honeycomb</strong> … The gaining of <strong>wisdom</strong> rewards the life the way the sweetness of taste is the reward of honey. We should learn to discern and appreciate the sweetness of wisdom. Once we appreciate the reward of wisdom, our <strong>hope will not be cut off</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 24:13-14).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your soul cannot endure without Jesus’ wisdom</u>. The psalmists and the prophets both called Yahweh’s Word a reward greater than the sweetest honey. “The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether. They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much pure gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.” (Ps. 19:9-10). “How sweet are Your words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” (Ps. 119:103). “Your words were found and I ate them, and Your words became a joy to me and the delight of my heart; for I have been called by Your name, LORD God of armies.” (Jer. 15:16). Jesus made each person to seek out and find communion with Him. While physical food will temporarily bring satisfaction, Jesus’ Word offers you eternal satisfaction in heaven. “But He answered and said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every Word that comes out of the mouth of God.’” (Matt. 4:4). “Jesus said to them, ‘I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.’ …It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.” (Jo. 6:35, 63).</p></li>

<p>The wisdom Jesus offers is better than honey and gives you the ability to persevere<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who are made righteous through Jesus’ wisdom will persevere when attacked</u>. For those who trust in Jesus’ wisdom, He will help them to endure in the face of the enemy’s attacks (Saying 27). “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>Do not lie in ambush, you wicked person, against the home of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place; <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>for a righteous person falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in time of disaster</em>.” (Prov. 24:15-16). “This proverb serves as both a cautionary tale and an encouragement. While the wicked may hope to take advantage of the vulnerable, they overlook the divine protection that surrounds the righteous. Ultimately, this scripture emphasizes that evil endeavors invite self-destruction, while steadfastness in virtue leads to enduring triumph. As mentioned, “the wicked shall fall into mischief,” illustrating the inevitable downfall that accompanies malicious actions. This truth resonates through various teachings about justice and the moral order of life outlined in Proverbs.” (The BibleSay.com on Prov. 24:15).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> “The passage underscores the struggles and perseverance of the righteous, asserting that even the just man may stumble multiple times yet finds it within himself to rise again. This resilience is a testament to a deeper reliance on God and the transformative power of repentance and faith. The just are not defined solely by their failures, but by their ability to rise and continue, embodying the spirit of hope and recovery.” (<em>Id</em>. at Prov. 24:16).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Persevere in your faith</u>.  When you encounter oppression, pray for Jesus’ strength to persevere.  “Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary.”  (Gal. 6:9).  “But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.”  (2 Thess. 3:13).  “You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.”  (Matt. 10:22).  Every believer will experience loss and setbacks because we live in a fallen world.  But you must never allow your setbacks to cause you to give up.  Instead, you must persevere in your faith.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ divine wisdom is based upon love and does not rejoice in a sinner’s destruction</u>. Jesus does not rejoice when a sinner is condemned (2 Pet. 3:9). Thus, you also should not rejoice in their misfortune (Saying 28). “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles, <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>otherwise, the Lord will see and be displeased, and turn His anger away from him.</em>” (Prov. 24:17-18). “When you hear that something bad has happened to someone you haven’t really liked very much, don’t say, ‘I’m glad that happened to him.’ … If you haven’t said that, you’ve thought it. God says, ‘Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth.’ That is not the way to solve the problem. Why? If you rejoice when your enemy falls, the Lord may turn around and start prospering that man. Then you really will be miserable. So there is a very practical reason for not rejoicing when your enemy falls.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 24:17-18).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Live out Jesus’ wisdom by showing His love to the lost<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Live out Jesus’ wisdom by loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you</u>. Jesus wants you to restrain your flesh when attacked. “Do not say, ‘I will repay evil’; wait for the LORD, and He will save you.” (Prov. 20:22). Instead, He wants you to love your enemies and pray for their repentance and salvation. “But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” (Matt. 5:44). “But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who are abusive to you.” (Lk. 6:27-28). “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.” (Ro. 12:14). “not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you would inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9). Jesus desires that every sinner repents and turns to Him in faith. “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also wants you to live out His wisdom by evangelizing the lost</u>. When you accept Jesus, His light should shine within you as a beacon to guide the lost: “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16). As part of Jesus’ Great Commission, He urges believers to share His offer of salvation to the lost: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”  (Matt. 28:18-20). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t envy the success of worldly wisdom because it will quickly vanish</u>. You never should feel tempted to envy or emulate the wicked over the wisdom that Jesus offers because any success that the wicked may enjoy will quickly disappear (Saying 29). “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>Do not get upset because of evildoers or be envious of the wicked; <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>for there will be no future for the evil person; the lamp of the wicked will be put out</em>.” (Prov. 24:19-20). “This verse reminds us that those who thrive through wickedness do not have lasting success. Their path is misleading, and we should not let their temporary gains distract us from our values and the goodness that resides within us. From our perspective, we might sometimes feel that those who cut corners, act dishonestly, or pursue selfish desires seem to get ahead. We might feel tempted to question our own choices or wonder if the right way is truly worth it. However, this scripture calls us to a higher ground. It’s a reminder that true success comes from living a life of integrity and faithfulness. Our values shape our character and future, and though it may seem slower or more challenging, it’s the path that leads to lasting fulfillment and peace.” (Jamie Wilson on Prov. 24:19-20).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Worldly wisdom and success will quickly fade</u>. While the wisdom of Jesus’ Word will last forever, those who seek success based upon worldly wisdom will find that their success will one day vanish. “When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, but the righteous has an everlasting foundation.” (Prov. 10:25). “The wicked are not so, but they are like chaff which the wind blows away.” (Ps. 1:4). “Do not get upset because of evildoers, do not be envious of wrongdoers. For they will wither quickly like the grass, and decay like the green plants…I have seen a wicked, violent person spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil. Then he passed away, and behold, he was no more; I searched for him, but he could not be found.” (Ps. 37:1-2, 35-36). “Do not be afraid when a person becomes rich, when the splendor of his house is increased; for when he dies, he will take nothing with him; his wealth will not descend after him.” (Ps. 49:16-17). “As for man, his days are like grass; like a flower of the field, so he flourishes. When the wind has passed over it, it is no more, and its place no longer knows about it.” (Ps. 103:15-16). “but the rich person is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich person, in the midst of his pursuits, will die out.” (Jam. 1:10-11).</p></li>

<h2 id="obedience-to-live-out-jesus-wisdom-be-obedient.-prov.-2421-25."><strong>5. <u>Obedience: To Live Out Jesus’ Wisdom, Be Obedient</u>. Prov. 24:21-25.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Submit to God’s wisdom through His leaders</u>. God’s wisdom and worldly wisdom might seem to be in conflict when it comes to obeying worldly leaders. But God gives leaders their positions (Dan. 2:21). Thus, unless a leader seeks to commit or enforce evil, God’s wisdom requires that you obey His leaders (Saying 30). “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>My son, fear the Lord and the king; do not get involved with those of high rank, <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>for their disaster will rise suddenly, and who knows the ruin that can come from both of them?</em>” (Prov. 24:21-22). “The phrase ‘fear thou the Lord’ signifies recognizing God’s authority and power. It is an invitation to reverence Him, much like how we respect our parents or teachers. This respect helps us stay grounded in our faith. It reminds us that God knows what’s best for us, and trusting in Him leads to wise decisions. We can look at Psalm 111:10, which says, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,’ reinforcing this idea that true wisdom comes alongside our respect for God. The term ‘meddle not with them that are given to change’ acts as a warning against unsteadiness in relationships. People who frequently change their opinions or values can be detrimental to our spiritual journey. We need to choose our friends wisely because they can influence us dramatically. If we associate with those who lack strong principles, it may lead us down paths contrary to our faith.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 24:21).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> In addition, Proverbs 24:22, “remind[s] us of the unpredictable nature of life. We often hope for stability, yet calamity doesn’t always give warning signs. This teaches us the need to remain vigilant, prepared to respond positively even in the face of challenges that arise unexpectedly. Life can sometimes shift dramatically without notice, so we must cultivate resilience rooted in our faith and a solid understanding of God’s word.” (<em>Id</em> at Prov. 24:22).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>First submit to God and then to His appointed leaders</u>. Solomon began by returning to His central theme of Proverbs. He urged believers to find wisdom and understanding by fearing God (Prov. 1:7; 2:5; 9:10; 15:33; Ps. 111:10; Job 28:28; Ecc. 12:13). The fear of the Lord is defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:13). Unless a leader’s requests violate God’s Word (Acts. 4:19; 5:29), refusing to submit to God’s appointed leaders is a form of evil. First, believers must submit to Him through the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:14), His Word (2 Tim. 3:16), and His church leadership (Matt. 18:17-20, Heb. 13:17). Second, unless they seek to do evil, believers should submit to civil authorities. “Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.” (1 Pet. 2:13-14). “Every person is to be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.” (Rom. 13:1-2). Third, believers should submit to God’s family order (Eph. 5:22-25; 6:10). Satan’s goal has always been to break down authority through rebellion. His goal is to create chaos and misery. Satan first led a third of the angels in rebellion against God’s rule (Rev. 12:3-9). He then led Eve to rebel against God’s rules (Gen. 3:1-4). He then led Adam and Eve to rebel against each other (Gen 3:16). When the Jews murmured against Moses in the wilderness, Moses stated “Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.” (Ex. 16:8b).Jesus once quoted a prophesy: “I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.” (Mark 14:23). Upon His arrest, the disciples scattered. If Satan had succeeded in deposing Moses, the nation of Israel would have fought with itself and lost its direction in the wilderness. Satan also tries to have people bring down their church, civic leaders, and family leaders through rebellion. Society has reaped chaos from its rebellions. When you have contempt toward God’s leaders, it is equivalent to having contempt toward God. (Ex. 16:8; 1 Sam. 8:7; Psalm 105:15).</p></li>

<p>Unless you are asked to engage in evil, fear God by obeying authority<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The wise are impartial and obey God’s standards of morality</u>. As a post-script to the “Thirty Sayings of the Wise, Solomon admonished believers to follow God’s standards for good and evil. These include being impartial and following God’s definitions of good and evil (Further Saying 1). “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>These also are sayings of the wise: to show partiality in judgment is not good. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>One who says to the wicked, ‘You are righteous,’ peoples will curse him, nations will scold him; <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>But for those who rebuke the wicked there will be delight, and a good blessing will come upon them</em>.” (Prov. 24:23-25). “Proverbs 24:23-25 is a passage that emphasizes the importance of justice and integrity, serving as a reminder of the moral and ethical standards that should guide our actions and decisions. These verses highlight the consequences of partiality and the blessings of righteous judgment. In a world where favoritism and corruption can often be seen, these verses call us to uphold justice and integrity in all our dealings. It is crucial to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their status or wealth. For instance, in a workplace scenario, favoritism from a manager can lead to a toxic work environment, while fair treatment fosters a positive and productive atmosphere.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 24:23-25).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God expects you to be impartial and to follow His standards of morality</u>. Although worldly people frequently show favoritism to people when they find some advantage for themselves, God calls upon believers to be impartial. “To show partiality to the wicked is not good, nor to suppress the righteous in judgment.” (Prov. 18:5). “You are not to show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You are not to be afraid of any person, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too difficult for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” (Dt. 1:17). “You shall not do injustice in judgment; you shall not show partiality to the poor nor give preference to the great, but you are to judge your neighbor fairly.” (Lev. 19:15). “Opening his mouth, Peter said: ‘I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,’ but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.” (Acts 10:34-35). “But from those who were of considerable repute (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism)—well, those who were of repute contributed nothing to me.” (Gal. 2:6). “For there is no partiality with God.” (Ro. 2:11). “My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism… But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as violators.” (Jam. 2:1, 9). God further condemns those who call evil good and good evil. “One who justifies the wicked and one who condemns the righteous, Both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.” (Prov. 17:15). “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” (Is. 5:20).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Diligent prayer and preparation can help others find God’s wisdom</u>. When you pray and prepare before you give advice, you can bring the joy of God’s wisdom to a person in need. (Further Saying 2). “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>One who gives a right answer kisses the lips</em>.” (Prov. 24:26). “The meaning of Proverbs 24:26 underscores the value of honesty in communication. This proverb draws a vivid comparison between an honest answer and a kiss on the lips, suggesting that truthfulness is not only pleasant but also deeply rewarding. In a time when deceit can sometimes be the easier path, this verse elevates the moral high ground of sincerity. When we think about a kiss on the lips, it conjures feelings of affection, warmth, and intimacy. Similarly, an honest answer fosters trust and strengthens relationships. It opens the door to deeper connections and mutual respect. This proverb encourages us to embrace honesty in our dealings, indicating that just as a kiss is valued for its tenderness, so too should we value truthful communication for the depth it brings to our interactions.” (Bibleversexplained.com on Prov. 24:26).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Godly wisdom that is verified through prayer and preparation can help others in need</u>. You can show the value of God’s wisdom to others when you diligently pray and prepare before offering counsel. “Righteous lips are the delight of kings, and one who speaks right is loved.” (Prov. 16:13). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in secret You will make wisdom known to me.” (Ps. 51:6). Through prayer, you can also ensure that you are speaking God’s truth. “These are the things which you shall do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace at your gates. Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these things are what I hate,’ declares the LORD.” (Zech. 8:16-17). Godly wisdom offered to others also shows that you have a godly heart. “The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.” (Lk. 6:45). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Diligently prepare before you step out in faith to serve</u>. To best serve God in building your house and helping His Church, He wants you to diligently prepare before you serve Him. (Further Saying 3). “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>Prepare your work outside, and make it ready for yourself in the field; afterward, then, build your house</em>.” (Prov. 24:27). “Get an estate into good order before erecting a house on it. To ‘build a house’ may, however, be equivalent (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm"><u>Exodus 1:21</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm"><u>Deuteronomy 25:9</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm"><u>Ruth 4:11</u></a>) to ‘founding a family;’ and the words a warning against a hasty and imprudent marriage. The young man is taught to cultivate his land before he has to bear the burdens of a family. Further, in a spiritual sense, the ‘field’ may be the man's outer common work, the ‘house’ the dwelling-place of his higher life. He must do the former faithfully in order to attain the latter. Neglect in one is fatal to the other.” (Albert Barnes Notes on the Bible, Prov. 24:27).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Use the wisdom that Jesus offers to diligently serve Him</u>. The enemy will oppose you when you seek to serve. Thus, Jesus wants you to be wise in your service. “For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who are watching it will begin to ridicule him, saying, ‘This person began to build, and was not able to finish!’” (Lk. 14:28-30). God is a God of order. Thus, your service should also be Spirit-led and orderly. “But all things must be done properly and in an orderly way.” (1 Cor. 14:40). Your goal should always be focused on glorifying Jesus and not yourself. “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for people, knowing that it is from the Lord that you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.” (Col. 3:23-24).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Only speak against another when led by the Spirit and in loving truth</u>. There are times when believers may be called to offer testimony against another or offer difficult words during either an official process or during a private rebuke. But such negative words must be carefully offered after prayer and as directed by the Holy Spirit with truth and love. (Further Saying 4). “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>Do not be a witness against your neighbor for no reason, and do not deceive with your lips. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Do not say, ‘I shall do the same to him as he has done to me; I will repay the person according to his work</em>.’” (Prov. 24:28-29). “This verse parallels the Bible’s many commands about honesty (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-16.html"><u>Proverbs 6:16</u></a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-19.html"><u>19</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/26/Proverbs-26-28.html"><u>26:28</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/34/Psalm-34-13.html"><u>Psalm 34:13</u></a>). Most such teachings, in fact, carry legal language which suggests things like formal witness testimony (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Exodus/20/Exodus-20-16.html"><u>Exodus 20:16</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/19/Proverbs-19-5.html"><u>Proverbs 19:5</u></a>). Here, however, the advice does not immediately mention lying. Rather, it simply says not to speak against others ‘without cause.’ It's possible to find criticism of anyone, for those willing to look hard enough. There's a marked difference between speaking out about sin and wrongdoing, versus cutting others down out of spite or jealousy. The lesson here is broad, harmonizing with other verses regarding peace and unity (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/5/Matthew-5-9.html"><u>Matthew 5:9</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/12/Romans-12-18.html"><u>Romans 12:18</u></a>) ..While the verse is primarily about speaking <em>against</em> others, it also mentions deception. Lying about others is never helpful. Also wrong is flattery (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/29/Proverbs-29-5.html"><u>Proverbs 29:5</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/12/Psalm-12-2.html"><u>Psalm 12:2–3</u></a>). Telling people what they want to hear, when it's not true—or purposefully exaggerated—is as much sin as is other lying (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/24/Proverbs-24-24.html"><u>Proverbs 24:24–26</u></a>). (BibleRef.com on Prov. 24:28).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> In Proverbs 24:29, “One attempts to "settle the score" by hurting another. That person strikes back, as they see it, to also "make things even." The first party disagrees and thinks this requires more, and more extreme measures. Neither ever agrees justice has been reached, so the cycle never concludes easily. Petty offenses turn into feuds and insults lead to open war.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 24:29).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When directed by the Holy Spirit, adverse words must be truthful and offered in love</u>. The Ninth Commandment prohibits false testimony. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.” (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20; 19:16-19; Lev. 19:11). Lies are among the sins that God “hates.” “There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to Him: … a lying tongue, …” (Prov. 6:17; 12:22). Those who fail to repent of their lies and false testimony will face judgment. “A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who declares lies will perish.” (Prov. 19:9, 15). “A false witness will perish, but a person who listens will speak forever.” (Prov. 21:28; Ps. 101:7). “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37). Believers cannot justify a lie as a response to another person’s lie or evil act. “Never repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all people.” (Ro. 12:17). “not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you would inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9). When required, negative words should be offered in love to restore a sinner. “Brothers and sisters, even if a person is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you are not tempted as well.” (Gal. 6:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be responsive to the calling of the Holy Spirit and obey His calling for you</u>. When the Holy Spirit directs you to serve, you must also be responsive and obey His calling without excuses in any place or circumstance. (Further Saying 5). “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>I passed by the field of a lazy one, and by the vineyard of a person lacking sense, <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>and behold, it was completely overgrown with weeds; its surface was covered with weeds, and its stone wall was broken down. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>When I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, and received instruction. <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>‘A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,’ <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Then your poverty will come like a drifter, and your need like an armed man.</em>” (Prov. 24:30-34). “Proverbs 24:30-34 specifically addresses the dangers of laziness and the need for diligence in our responsibilities. It reminds us that neglecting our duties and succumbing to idleness will result in adverse consequences. The passage challenges us to examine our lives, identifying areas where we may be prone to laziness or neglect, and taking proactive steps to cultivate discipline and productivity. Ultimately, Proverbs 24:30-34 serves as a call to action, urging us to reject laziness and embrace diligence in all areas of our lives. By being attentive to our responsibilities, nurturing our relationships, and investing in our personal growth, we can avoid the pitfalls of neglect and experience the blessings of a fruitful and purposeful life.” (TalktotheWord.com on Prov. 24:30-34).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Avoid the Sin of Slothfulness When the Holy Spirit Calls Upon You to Serve<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Work diligently for Jesus</u>. Solomon frequently warned against the sin of slothfulness. “Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.” (Prov. 10:4-5). “The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor.” (Prov. 12:24). “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). “Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger.” (Prov. 19:15). “The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work;” (Prov. 21:25). “Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks.” (Ecc. 10:18). Jesus has given every person gifts. He also warns every person about the sin of failing to use His gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30).</p></li>
