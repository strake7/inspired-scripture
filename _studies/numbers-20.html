<p>Numbers Chapter 20: Seven Rules For Living by Faith in the Wilderness</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Serve God During Your Time in The Wilderness of Life</span>. Nu. 20:1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The missing years</span>. On the first month of their 40<sup>th</sup> year after leaving Egypt, the Jews traveled through the wilderness of zin to a camp called “Kadesh” (Nu. 20:1). This place should have seemed familiar. They Jews had just spent 37 years and six months walking in a circle. Thirty seven years earlier, the Jews rebelled against God at Kadesh believing that they would die if they entered the Promised Land (Nu. 14:1-4). For the majority of the wilderness years, the Bible says nothing about the Jews’ journey. These were the wasted years. There was nothing redeeming for God to record. If you live as a carnal Christian, you will have your place in heaven. But nothing will be written about your time when you get to heaven. Your years will also be wasted. In spending an eternity in heaven, do you want your scrap book from your life on Earth to be filled with acts of faith, charity, and love towards others? Or, do you want it to be empty?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The missing opportunity</span>. At Kadesh, Miriam died (Nu. 20:1). Rabbis note that her passing was observed with no warmth or memorial. The Bible says nothing about how or why she died. She was once credited for helping to return a cursed baby Moses to his mother (Ex. 2:4-9). <strong>Eighty years later, after God crushed Pharaoh’s army, Miriam was called a “prophetess” as she sang His praise (Ex. 15:20). Yet, like Satan, Miriam’s honor caused her to covet power. This in turn caused her to slander Moses for marrying a black woman from Cush (Sudan) (Nu. 12:1).</strong> The penalty under the Law for her coveting his power was death (Jam. 1:14-15; <strong>Heb. 10:28</strong>). God could have struck her dead for her sins. <strong>He instead gave her</strong> leprosy for seven days (Nu. 12:10-15). He also allowed her to live another 37 years. She was saved for her faith. She was written in God’s book as a Saint upon her death (Micah 6:4). Yet, nothing is written about her life during her 37 years of grace. Like the Jews, she had squandered the grace she was given. Many people are the most on fire for God when saved. Did you once passionately sing His praises like Miriam? Like Miriam, have your passions cooled after being rebuked? How much is being written in your book?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Trust God to Provide and Be Your Rock in the Desert</span>. Nu. 20:2-12; Ex. 15:22-27.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Where God guides, He provides</span>. For their entire 40 years in the wilderness, God provided for the Jews. He freed them from Egyptian bondage (Ex. 7:6-11:10). He crushed the Egyptian army (Ex. 13:7-15:21). He also transformed the waters of Marah to provide drinking water (Ex. 15:22-27). He then provided both manna and quail after they grumbled about their food (Ex. 16:1-8). He provided the “rabble” (half breeds) meat when they grew tired of His manna (Nu. 11:4-6, 32-33). He was also guiding them by a visible pillar of light both by day and by night (Ex. 13:21-22; 14:19). He even protected their feet from swelling (Dt. 8:4). When the Jews arrived at Kadesh, did they have any reason to doubt that God would provide for them?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The rock symbolized God’s provision for the Jews</span>. Because the water flowed from the rock, the rock symbolized His provision for the Jews in the wilderness. “<em>He opened the rock and water flowed out;</em> it ran in the dry places like a river.” (Ps. 106:41). “They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He made the water flow out of the rock for them; <em>He split the rock and the water gushed forth</em>.” (Is. 48:21). “. . . from the rock I would satisfy you.” (Ps. 81:16). Where did the water come from the rest of the time that the Jews were in the wilderness? Some believe that God provided the water through natural wells. Yet, according to one Jewish tradition, the water came from a rock that God dragged through the wilderness (Moshe Weissman, <em>the Midrash Says, Shemot</em>, vol 2, (Brooklyn NY, Benai Yakov p. 157). Paul likewise explained: “ and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock <em>which followed them; and the rock was Christ</em>.” (1 Cor. 10:3-4).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God provides for all our needs</span>. God cares for us in the wilderness (Hos. 13:5). Jesus is our manna (Jo. 6:35). We also do not need to worry about our provision (Matt. 6:31-34). If we complain about our provision, how much trust do we have in God?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus is also the Rock of our salvation</span>. The Jews also understood the Rock to symbolize salvation: “O come, let us sing for joy to the Lord, let us shout joyfully to <em>the rock of our salvation</em>.” (Ps. 95:1). “For I proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe greatness to our God! <em>The Rock</em>! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice.” (Dt. 32:3-4). “Trust in the Lord forever, for we have <em>an everlasting Rock</em>.” (Is. 26:4). You will never thirst when you drink His water (Jo. 4:14; 6:36; 7:37-38). Are you looking for God to take care of your immediate needs or your eternal ones?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The foreshadow of Jesus’ death and resurrection</span>. According to Jewish tradition, Miriam died on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of Nissan. This was the day that the Passover Lamb was selected, and the day that Jesus entered Jerusalem. Miriam represented the prophetic part of Moses’ ministry. With her death, the water of life stopped flowing. Moses would have mourned Miriam for seven days. That many days without water would have caused the Jews to fear for themselves and their animals. If Moses struck the rock on the seventh day, this would have been the same day that Jesus rose from the tomb. He then poured out abundant life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Leave Your Old Flesh Behind in the Wilderness</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Don’t look back at your old life</span>. God renamed Kadesh as “Meribah,” (Nu. 20:13) which means to “quarrel,” because the Jews quarreled with God and failed to trust Him. Four times, the Jews longed for their life in Egypt. First, only after a month in the desert, the Jews moaned that their old life was so much easier in Egypt. They believed that they “sat by the pots of meat” and that they “ate bread to the full.” (Ex. 16:3). Second, just after leaving Mount Horeb, they longed for fish, melons, cucumbers, leeks, onions, and garlic in Egypt (Nu. 11:5). Third, at the edge of the Promised Land, they decided to select a leader to take them back to Egypt (Nu. 14:4). Finally, 37 and a half years later, they again longed for Egypt while at Kadesh (Nu. 20:5). All the good things in life come from heaven (Jam. 1:17). Thus, we are also told that we sin when we complain (Jam. 4:9). If you long for your old life, are you fit for Jesus’ kingdom? (Lk. 9:62).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Complaining is a problem of distorted perception</span>. Satan wanted the Jews to forget their bondage, the whippings, and the toil that they experienced under the hot sun in Egypt. He wanted them to instead cling to his counterfeit pleasures. Then Satan made the Jews forget the misery that the Jews suffered in Egypt. They were slaves. They had no power. They had no protection. Their first born boys were killed (Ex. 1:22). Their lives in bondage were also bitter and hard (Ex. 1:14). When you indulge your flesh, the enemy will tempt you with your old life. Sin may be pleasurable for a season (Heb. 11:25), but it does not make you happy in the long-run. When a drug or alcohol addict has a craving, they do not typically remember the bad things that come along with their addiction. People frequently believe that Christians must give up the fun of life. Could you explain from your own life why what God promises is so much better than the counterfeit pleasures that Satan offers?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Complaining is a result of failure to submit to God</span>. We do not have the right to know the answer to why every bad thing happens. As mere clay, we do not have the right to question the Potter (Is. 45:9). Our ways and thoughts are beneath His ways and thoughts (Is. 55:8).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Grow from Your Trials in the Wilderness</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God tests us</span>. God could have made it rain at Kadesh/Meribah. Or, He could have provided spring water as the people arrived. Instead, He tested the Jews (Dt. 8:15-16; Ps. 81:7; Jer. 17:10; Ps. 11:5). Can you think of any reasons why a just and loving God would test the Jews with water? By petitioning Moses, who were they trusting? If their journey was care free, how much would they depend upon God? Has God led you into a place where you are forced to live off less? If so, He is trying to show you something.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God wants to show you the hidden sins in your heart.</span> God warns that there are lessons for us to learn from the Jews’ failure at Meribah: “Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, … When your fathers tested Me, they tried Me, though they had seen My world, for forty years I loathed that generation . . .” (Ps. 95:8-9). God was trying to show the Jews the evil in their hearts by testing them in the wilderness (Jer. 17:9). He, however, reveals the Jews also “tested” Him. (Jer. 17:9). You also test Him when you make demands of Him. If you were never tested, would you know if you were on track spiritually? How strong would your walk be if you never faced challenges and never had to depend upon Him?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God wants you to learn patience</span>. God could have given the Jews a life of comfort and a quick trip to the Promise Land. Yet, if He gave them everything that they asked for, they would never learn patience (Ps. 106:14). Most likely, He has not immediately answered all of your prayers. Has your patience grown as you have matured in the Lord?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s wants you to mediate on His provision in your life</span>. David wrote that he mediated on “all Your work and muse on Your deeds.” (Ps. 77:10-12). God had at this point provided manna and water for almost 40 years (Ex. 16:13). If Jews had meditated on all that He had done for them, they would not have likely complained about their water at Kadesh/Meribah. If you are lacking in faith, have you meditated on all that He has done in your life? When was the last time you created a list of all the things that He has accomplished in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God wants you to learn to be grateful</span>. At the time of this festival on <em>Sukkot</em>, the Jews build small booths to live in for a week. They celebrated God’s provision during their time in the wilderness (Ex. 25:8; 29:44-45; Dt. 16:13-15). Paul warns to do all things “without grumbling or disputing.” (Phil. 2:14). In “everything”, you are to “give thanks” (1 Thess. 5:18). Do you give thanks for everything, even your food and water?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Turn your trials into growth opportunities</span>. God want us to treat every trial with joy (Jam. 1:2). For those who persevere under trial, He promises them a blessing (Jam. 1:12). How have you grown from your trials? Do you believe in the desert that all things are working together for good because you love God and are called according to His purpose? (Rom. 8:28). How have used your experiences in the wilderness to help others?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Being a disciple of Christ includes trials</span>. Jesus tells us that His yoke is easy (Matt. 11:30). Yet, we see that Abraham, Moses, the Jews, Jesus, Paul, and all of the prophets endured hardships. How can Jesus’ statement be true when we see what these people endured? You may experience hardships, but He will give you peace of mind when you encounter them.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God shows you His mercy and grace when you suffer</span>. God provided every time the Jews complained about their food or water (Dt. 9:6-8). He did so even though they did not deserve His gifts. Are you thankful for the grace He gives you for your underserved gifts?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <span class="underline">Under the Law, You Cannot Reach the Promised Land</span>. Nu. 20:12-13.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Moses as the Law giver was judged by his own standards</span>. According to Jesus: “in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.” (Matt. 7:2). Moses gave the Law, and he symbolized it. He was the most humble man on the planet (<strong>Nu. 12:3</strong>). Yet, even the most humble man is still human. For forty years, the Jews provoked him. At the time the Jews complained at Kadesh/Meribah, he was still in his seven days of grieving the loss of his sister (Nu. 20:1). The Jews’ complaints provoked him to anger (Ps. 106:32). Out of wrath, he grumbled that the Jews were “rebels” (Nu. 20:10). Yet, he had just rebelled against God’s instructions to speak to the rock. Moreover, he previously warned the Jews that they had sinned against God with their grumbling (Ex. 16:8). By his grumbling and his accusations, he was guilty of breaking the standards that he set. Do you judge others? Are you ready to be judged by the same standard? (Matt. 7:1).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">No one can be saved under the Law</span>. Moses later pleaded with God to change the punishment, but God would not do so (Dt. 3:25-26). The punishment was harsh, but it served a purpose. Because he gave and symbolized the Law, people had the right to expect the he live by his standards. Ultimately, he was not able to avoid breaking the Law. He was a sinner like all of us. None are righteous enough under the Law to be saved (Ro. 3:23). If Moses broke just one law, he was guilty of breaking all of them (Jam 2:10).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Moses could not act in faith while he responded in anger</span>. Moses’ name means to “draw out.” He was drawn out of the water at birth. God later meant for him to draw the water out of the rock. He told Moses to “speak to the rock” to cause it to pour forth water (Nu. 20:8). The power to create from speech was a power that only God possessed (Gen. 1:1). Yet, Moses failed to draw out the water with the power God gave him. After Moses called the Jews “rebels,” he said: “shall <em>we</em> bring forth water from this rock?” (Nu. 20:10). Then, instead of speaking to the rock, he struck it with his rod. He further did so not once but twice (Nu. 20:11). After God provided for the Jews, He rebuked Moses for failing to believe Him (Nu. 20:12). Moses was not giving God credit for this miracle. From this example, God also reveals that you cannot act in faith when you are angry. If you are angered by others, are you trusting that God is in control?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus only needed to die once</span>. If Moses had been commanded to strike the rock, he should have done so only once. Christ was the rock, and he was stricken once for us. He did not need to die twice. Are you trying to earn your right to salvation by being a good person?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Moses failed to sanctify the Lord</span>. God said that Moses did not “treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel.” (Nu. 20:12; 27:14). It is one thing to curse or grumble in private. Yet, if we do these things in front of others, what kind of message do we send about what it means to be a Christian? Are you one of the Church hypocrites that people complain about?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The acts of the flesh cannot please God</span>. When you are born again, your old self and your old desires should pass away (Ro. 6:6). Yet, there are times when your old self will reappear (Eph. 4:22; Col. 3:9). Christ said that “the flesh profits nothing.” (Jo. 6:63). Here, Moses acted out of anger. God cannot accept your works when they are done out of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21). Moses was a poor witness for God when he acted out of anger. If you yell, quarrel with others, or complain, what kind of a witness are you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God is faithful to provide, even when His leaders fail</span>. Even though Moses failed to follow His directions, God still poured forth abundant water from the rock (Nu. 20:11). Even if our leaders fail us, God will never leave us or forsake us (Heb. 13:5-6).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">The Way that Seems Right to Man Leads to Death</span>. Nu. 20:14-22.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Holy Spirit may not guide you when you are in sin</span>. Until this point, God guided the Jews by a visible pillar of light both by day and by night (Ex. 13:21-22; 14:19). Now, they were left to guess which route to take. Moses once asked his first wife Zipporah’s brother, Hobab, to advise him on his travels (Nu. 10:29-32). Similarly, he let his father-in-law Jethro advise him on delegating authority (Ex. 18:17-27). Now, he had neither God nor wise counsel to guide him. Going around Edom would add 100 miles to their trip. So Moses wrote a Moabite king for permission to cross his land. The pillar of guidance disappeared because of their sin (1 Ch. 5:20; Prov. 15:29). Even though the Holy Spirit will not leave you, your prayers can be hindered when you sin (1 Pet. 3:7; Is. 59:2; 35:8).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The road to destruction is a highway, the path to salvation is narrow</span>. Without God to lead them, Moses at first thought that he should travel through Moab along a well-traveled route called the “king’s highway.” (Nu. 20:17). This route from Acaba to Amman still exists today in Jordan. Moses wrote to the Moab king to announce that his intentions were friendly. He reminded the Moabites that the nations were related through Abraham. He also reminded the Moabite king of the Jews’ 400 years of suffering in Egypt (Nu. 20:14-18). Moses expected a friendly reception from a related nation. Traveling the “king’s highway” was the route that seemed the quickest and the safest. The Jews were surprised by the Moabite king’s threats of war against the Jews. Moses realized that God had not called them to go down this path and fight their kin. He did not want to make the “sin of presumption” that some Jews made in trying to force their way into the Promised Land when God had told them not to enter. The Amalekites and the Canaanites killed those Jews (Nu. 14:39-45). Solomon warned: “There is a way that seems right to a man. But it ends in the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12; 16:25). Jesus also warned: “. . . the way is broad that leads to destruction . . . the way is narrow that leads to life.” (Matt. 7:13-14). Are you traveling down the broad “king’s highway”? Or, are you traveling down the narrow path of the “King of Kings”? If you are looking to follow the people around you, which path are you taking?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Don’t fight unless God leads you to do so</span>. The Jews had no reason to think that these related people would threaten to go to war with them merely because the Jews wanted to cross their territory. If the Jews were being led by their pride or their flesh, they might have felt tempted to fight their way through. But God had not told them to attack. Without clear direction from God, believers should never attack others or fight with others.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Let God avenge those who wrong you</span>. Later, God condemned Edom “because he pursued his brother with the sword.” (Amos 1:11). Thus, God promised that it would be “cut off.” (Obed. 1:10-12). Are you letting God avenge the wrongs against you? (Ro. 12:19).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Without Faith You Can’t Leave the Wilderness</span>. Nu. 20:23-29.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">If Moses Symbolized the Law, Aaron symbolized faith</span>. By Jewish tradition, Aaron died four months after Miriam. He was 123 years old. He and Moses were the last two remaining people to die from the old generation before the Jews could enter the Promised Land. Aaron’s death was a punishment for when he “rebelled against [God’s] command at the waters of Meribah.” (Nu. 20:24). He also did not seek the Lord’s guidance as high priest on whether to travel through Edom. Yet, Aaron died a noble death. The people mourned him for 30 days, just as they later would for Moses (Nu. 20:29; Dt. 34:8). If Moses symbolized the Law as the law giver, Aaron symbolized faith because he was the high priest. We also cannot enter the Promised Land without faith (Heb. 3:19).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A priest is held to a higher standard</span>. Moses most likely deserved to be taken before Aaron, Although both had anger toward the Jews, Moses was the one who spoke. Yet, Aaron was the high priest who was to be beyond reproach. From this example, we see that priests are held to a higher standard than civil leaders. We are God’s holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). Thus, you are held to a higher example. Are you living as an example to others? Or, are you talking and acting like non-believers? Are you going to all the same places and watching the same shows? Are you filling your mind with trash and your body with drugs or alcohol?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Only the greater High Priest can lead us into the Promised Land.</span> Aaron lacked the faith to bring the people into the Promised Land: “The former priests, on the other hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing.” (Heb. 7:23). Jesus is the one true High Priest with the faith to lead us to the Promised Land (Heb. 7:24).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Leave behind your self-righteous acts</span>. In addition to provision, clothing in the Bible can also symbolize a person’s habits, acts, endeavors, or righteousness (Isa. 64:6). They can also symbolized the honor a person held during his or her life. Moses put the robes of honor on Aaron (Lev. 8:7-9). Before his death, Moses stripped Aaron of his robes of righteousness (Nu. 20:28). Aaron, like us, entered life naked. Like us, he left life the same way. Yet, if you arrive at the wedding to the King of King’s without your new clothes, you will be thrown out of heaven (Rev. 3:17; 16:5). If you overcome the world through faith in Him, He will clothe you in fine garments that you need in heaven (Rev. 19:8).</p></li>
</ul>
