<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the ninth Song of Ascents (Ps. 120–134). This psalm continues God’s message of encouragement to the Jews who sought to rebuild the Temple, Jerusalem, Israel, and the Davidic monarchy following Babylonian captivity. “The Songs of Ascent seemed to build up to the Ps 127 fulfillment of the 2 Sam 7 promise of Yahweh to build David a house and to raise up his seed after him who would build Yahweh’s house. Flowing out of those fulfillments, Ps. 128 celebrates the way all who fear Yahweh enjoy the blessings of the covenant.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 128).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Here, God reveals the blessings that He offered to both individuals and families if they chose to fear and obey Him. These included: (1) wisdom, (2) contentment, (3) strong marriages, (4) strong families, (5) strong communities, (6) blessed legacies, and (7) peace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist declared that anyone who fears God and walks in His ways will be blessed. Other psalms define this blessing of reverent obedience as God’s wisdom. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist further declared that those who fear God and walk in His ways will be happy with the fruit of their labors. Reverent obedience can also lead to God’s blessing of contentment with His provision in your life. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist also stated that anyone who fears God and walks in His ways can have a spouse who “<em>will be like a fruitful vine within your house</em>.” Reverent obedience can also lead to God’s blessing of a strengthened marriage. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist further revealed that anyone who fears God and walks in His ways can have “<em>children like olive plants around your table</em>.” This was a sign of family fellowship. Reverent obedience can also lead to God’s blessing of a united family. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist further declared that those who fear God and walk in His ways will “<em>see the prosperity of Jerusalem</em>.” This was a sign of shared community prosperity. Reverent obedience can also lead to God’s blessing of strengthened communities. This blessing can be, but is not always, a monetary blessing. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist also revealed that those who fear God and walk in His ways can live to see their “<em>children’s children</em>.” This blessing includes a prolonged life. But it also implied God’s blessing of a strong family legacy for those who live their lives with reverent obedience. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist concluded with a prayer for peace. Reverent obedience can bring God’s blessing of peace.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in reverence and obedience</u>. The psalmist promised a blessing to both Jews and gentiles for  those whose faith produced the fruit of obedience. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Blessed is everyone who fears the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who walks in His ways</em>.” (Ps. 128:1). As a result of original sin, mankind has been forced to live in a cursed world with strife and hardship (Gen. 3:17-19). As a result of Israel’s serious sins, its people were temporarily cursed (Dt. 28:30). But God offers a path for believers to find His blessings in a cursed world. “The blessings of those who fear God. - Only those who are truly holy, are truly happy. In vain do we pretend to be of those that fear God, if we do not make conscience of keeping steadfastly to his ways. Blessed is everyone that fears the Lord; whether he be high or low, rich or poor in the world.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 128:1-6).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Reverent fear in the form of avoiding evil leads to the blessing of wisdom</u>. Another psalm proclaims, “<em>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;</em>” (Ps. 111:10). After squandering God’s blessings of intelligence and wealth, Solomon reached the same conclusion: “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge</em>; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom</em>, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10). Based upon his mistakes, he also exhorted believers to let their reverent fear of God lead to obedience: “The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is: <em>fear God and keep His commandments</em>, because this applies to every person.” (Ecc. 12:13). The prophet Samuel also urged believers in his farewell address to let their fear of God lead to obedience: “<em>Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart</em>; for consider what great things He has done for you.” (1 Sam. 12:24). Job was considered “blameless” because his reverent fear of God led him to always obey: “There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, <em>fearing God</em> and turning away from evil.” (Job 1:1). Fearing the Lord is defined in the Bible as “hating” what God calls evil (Prov. 8:13). Thus, if you fear God by avoiding what He calls evil, He offers the blessing of wisdom.</p></li>

<p>Reverent obedience leads to God’s blessings, which includes His wisdom<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fear of the Lord includes obedience</u>. Moses proclaimed that fearing God includes a desire to obey out of obedience. “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to <em>fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him</em>, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,” (Dt. 10:12). Thus, David declared, ‘<em>For I have kept the ways of the LORD</em>, and have not acted wickedly against my God.”’ (2 Sam. 22:22). Solomon also declared, “Now then, sons, listen to me, for <em>blessed are those who keep my ways</em>.” (Prov. 8:32). This blessing is also repeated in an earlier psalm. “<em>Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD</em>.” (Ps. 119:1). God also gave a similar message through the prophets. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find a resting place for your souls.” (Jer. 6:16a). Jesus says that if you love Him, you will keep His “Commandments” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6; Matt. 19:17). He is the great “I AM” who gave Moses the Ten Commandments  (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). But he came to correct people’s motives in following the Ten Commandments.  He wants your obedience to be motivated by love and not obligation.  He therefore summarized the Ten Commandments as something that comes naturally once a person loves the Lord and his or her neighbor (Matt. 22:35-38; Lk. 10:27; Dt. 6:5).  Moses taught us to live obediently as it is written.  Jesus taught us to love obediently as it is written.  Whether you keep the Ten Commandments out of love (and not obligation) is also the test regarding whether you really “know” Jesus:  “By this we know that we have come to <em>know</em> Him, if we keep His commandments.”  (1 Jo. 2:3).  Some will come to Jesus boasting of their works or compliance with the Law.  But if their works or their compliance with the Law was not motivated by a love for Him, He may respond “I never <em>knew</em> you.”  (Matt. 7:23). If you obey the Law for the right reasons, you become a slave to righteousness.  But if you do not obey the Law, you are likely to become a slave to sin (Ro. 6:12, 16; Jo. 8:34). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. When your faith does not produce the fruit of obedience, it is time to examine your heart: “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” (Jam. 2:17). A believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. But He is not your Lord if you disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt. 7:26). Jesus also warned: “For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:14). Is your faith evidenced through obedience to Jesus’ Word?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for the wisdom to stay on God’s path</u>. David prayed for God’s wisdom to stay on His path. “<em>Teach me Your way</em>, LORD; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.” (Ps. 86:11). In contrast, Solomon misused his God-given wisdom for his own glory. Thus, you should always pray for God’s wisdom to guide you on His path.</p></li>

<h2 id="contentment-reverent-obedience-leads-to-contentment.-ps.-1282."><strong>2. <u>Contentment: Reverent Obedience Leads to Contentment</u>. Ps. 128:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in Spirit-led obedience with contentment</u>. The psalmist further revealed that God offers the blessing of contentment for those who walk in faith-led obedience. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>When you eat the fruit of the labor of your hands, you will be happy and it will go well for you</em>.” (Ps. 128:2). In addition to contentment, this includes God’s protection. “This is the first point of the ‘blessedness.’ God’s faithful servant shall enjoy the fruits of his own industry, and not have them devoured by strangers” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-11.htm">Psalm 109:11</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 128:2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-128/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.07037in;height:3.36626in" alt="psalms 128:2 Archives - I Live For JESUS" /></p>
<p>God offers you the blessings of provision and contentment when you labor for Him<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give God the first fruits of your labors</u>. When the Jews returned from Babylonian captivity, the prophet Haggai warned that some Jews labored in vain because they focused on their own needs instead of rebuilding God’s Temple. ‘“You have sown much, only to harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but there is not enough for anyone to get warm; and the one who earns, earns wages to put into a money bag full of holes … You start an ambitious project, but behold, it comes to little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?’ declares the LORD of armies. ‘It is because of My house which remains desolate, while each of you runs to his own house.”’ (Hagg. 1:6,9). For those who are faithful in their tithing, God also promises to bless them (Mal. 3:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be content with what God has given you</u>. The prosperity of any nation comes from God (Dt. 8:17-18). For any believer, greed, idolatry, and lust all stem from a lack of contentment with God’s grace and His provision: “But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.” (1 Tim. 6:6). “Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.” (Phil. 4:11). “Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; . . .” (Heb. 13:5a). Are you content with God’s blessings in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>David declared his confidence that God would provide for his needs</u>. Even though he was at times homeless and under attack, David always trusted God to provide for him: “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I will not be in need.” (Ps. 23:1). “Fear the LORD, you His saints; for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything. The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:9-10). “For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.” (Ps. 84:11). Solomon made a similar promise: “The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, but He will reject the craving of the wicked.” (Prov. 10:3). Thus, when you place your trust in God, you can trust Him to always provide for your needs, not your wants.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you walk with God, He can bless the fruit of your labors if it is for His glory</u>. The blessings of provision and contentment come with the responsibility to be a co-laborer for God’s glory. “We are not to leave our worldly callings because the Lord has called us by grace: we are not promised a blessing upon romantic idleness or unreasonable dreaming, but upon hard work and honest industry. Though we are in God’s hands we are to be supported by our own hands. He will give us daily bread, but it must be made our own by labour. All kinds of labour are here included; for if one toils by the sweat of his brow, and another does so by the sweat of his brain, there is no difference in the blessing; save that it is generally more healthy to work with the body than with the mind only. Without God it would be vain to labour; but when we are labourers together with God a promise is set before us. The promise is that labour shall be fruitful, and that he who performs it shall himself enjoy the recompense of it.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 128:2).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="a-strong-marriage-reverent-obedience-strengthens-a-marriage.-ps.-1283a."><strong>3. <u>A Strong Marriage: Reverent Obedience Strengthens a Marriage</u>. Ps. 128:3a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in Spirit-led obedience with a strengthened marriage</u>. When your faith produces the fruit of obedience, the psalmist reveals that God also offers to bless your marriage. “<strong><sup>3a </sup></strong><em>Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house, ..</em>.” (Ps. 128:3a). “The psalmist now turns his attention to the family and how God blesses it. In verse 3 we read, ‘Your wife <em>shall be</em> like a fruitful vine in the innermost chambers of your house.’ The point of comparison (a simile) is to say that the spouse will flourish and to be productive, just like a fruitful vine. The image also suggests grace and beauty. The simile is further qualified by the location as ‘in the innermost chambers of your house.’ The word (<span dir="rtl">יבֵ֫יתֶ֥ך</span>ָ), literally ‘sides of,’ refers to the most private place of the lodging, probably the private room of the wife. Here the ‘fruitful vine’ can flourish and be productive.” (Allen Ross on Ps.128:3) (italics in original).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s blessings for faith-led obedience can sometimes include fertility</u>. The reference to a “<em>fruitful vine</em>” implied fertility (Ps. 128:3a). Throughout the Old Testament, God promised to bless with fertility those who obeyed Him out of faith: “So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you.” (Lev. 26:9). “And He will love you, bless you, and make you numerous; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain, your new wine, and your oil, the newborn of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you.” (Dt. 7:13). “Blessed will be the children of your womb, the produce of your ground, and the offspring of your animals: the newborn of your herd and the young of your flock … And the LORD will give you more than enough prosperity, in the children of your womb, in the offspring of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you.” (Dt. 28:4, 11). But God sometimes allows believers to struggle with infertility if it is part of His greater plans (Ro. 8:28). Thus, you should be careful not to look at your circumstances to determine whether God has withheld a blessing of fertility.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s blessings of fertility are based upon grace</u>. Anyone’s child is a reward from God: “Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, the fruit of the womb is a reward.” (Ps. 127:3). Thus, because many wicked people have children, God’s blessings are based upon grace.</p></li>

<p>If Jesus is the head of any marriage, He offers to bless the husband and wife<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s blessing upon a marriage can include love, joy, and companionship</u>. God provided the blessing of marriage to bless both men and women with the same love for one another that He feels towards us. “Then the LORD God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.”’ (Gen. 2:18). “Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor; for if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up! Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone? (Ecc. 4:9-11). Thus, the blessing of marriage is not limited to the joy of children. If both spouses love and obey God, it includes love, joy, protection, and companionship.</p></li>

<h2 id="a-strong-family-reverent-obedience-strengthens-a-family.-ps.-1283b-4."><strong>4. <u>A Strong Family: Reverent Obedience Strengthens a Family</u>. Ps. 128:3b-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s blessings can also include a strengthened family</u>. When your faith produces the fruit of family obedience, the psalmist further reveals that God offers to bless your family. “<strong><sup>3b</sup></strong> <em>… your children like olive plants around your table</em>. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Behold, for so shall a man who fears the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be blessed</em>.” (Ps. 128:3b-4). “And so this first section of Psalm 128 paints a beautiful picture for us. A godly husband, a faithful wife and eager children full of promise – all this is a great sign of God’s blessing in the home. Once again, what more can you ask than God’s blessing on you and those you love? Notice this first section of the psalm highlights God’s blessing on your work, your marriage, and your family. All three of these were God’s provision for us in creation. All three of these were also cursed by God following our fall into sin. But now here in Psalm 128 we see God reverse the curse and bring blessing in all three of these areas when you fear the Lord and walk in his ways. These verses do not mean that God grants marriage and family to all, but rather this is one of ways he blesses the godly.” (Ray Fowler on Ps. 128:1-4).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Family communion</u>. The psalmist stated that the children of a believer who fear the Lord gather “<em>around your table</em>.” (Ps. 128:3). This means that a strong family dines together. In the Bible, dining together was a sign of close fellowship. This is the type of close communion that Jesus offers every believer who seeks out a relationship with Him. “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.” (Rev. 3:20). Thus, God’s blessing of children was meant to enrich the entire family with support and fellowship.  This blessing also implies that families should make active efforts to dine together and spend time with each other and support the other person.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strong-community-reverent-obedience-strengthens-communities.-ps.-1285"><strong>5. <u>Strong Community: Reverent Obedience Strengthens Communities</u>. Ps. 128:5</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in Spirit-led obedience with strong communities</u>. When your faith produces the fruit of obedience, the psalmist further reveals that God offers a community of believers the blessing of a shared prosperity. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> bless you from Zion, and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life</em>.” (Ps. 128:5). “<strong>May you see the good of Jerusalem</strong>: For the one who fears the LORD, it is a blessing <em>for</em> him to see <strong>the good of Jerusalem</strong>. It shows that there is a sense in which a happy home is not enough; we must also have care for our community and nation.” (David Guzik on Ps. 128:5) (emphasis in original).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A God-fearing believer is blessed through fellowship with a community of believers</u>. Many may read the word “prosperity” and assume that this is a monetary blessing. But it speaks more to the blessing of a strong faith-based community. “The prosperity, the happiness of Jerusalem: that is, the good of the church; the advancement of pure religion. The Hebrew might be rendered, ‘And look thou upon the good of Jerusalem’ - in the imperative; and, thus rendered, it would be a command to regard, in these circumstances, the welfare of Jerusalem, or the prosperity of the church; but the language will also admit of the other construction, and the connection seems to require it. Thus understood, it is a promise that he who is referred to would be permitted to enjoy a view of the continual prosperity of religion in the world.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 128:5).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God provides for the needs, not wants, of a community that serves Him</u>. The blessing of faith-led obedience includes God’s promise to provide for the needs of the community<em>:</em> “Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever<em>.”</em> (Ps. 112:3). All income and wealth are gifts from God. “Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.” (Jam. 1:17). Because many wicked people also have wealth, God’s provision is also based upon His grace and His divine plans (Ro. 8:28). Thus, if God blesses a nation or individuals within it, the community must look to ensure that opportunities for prosperity are available to all who are willing to labor for God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also promises to provide for a community’s needs</u>. God’s promise to provide for the needs of a community is repeated in the New Testament: “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “So if you, despite being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!” (Matt. 7:11). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). Thus, Jesus wants any community of believers to focus on seeking and following His will and then trusting Him to provide for the needs of the community.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t place your trust in your wealth</u>. The blessings in this verse can come in the form of monetary prosperity, but it is not limited to wealth. If God does bless a community with prosperity, He wants believers to place their trust in Him and not in their wealth: “This is what the LORD says: ‘Let no wise man boast of his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast of his might, nor a rich man boast of his riches;”’ (Jer. 9:23). The psalmist warned against: “Those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches?” (Ps. 49:6). “For the wicked boasts of his soul’s desire, and the greedy person curses and shows disrespect to the LORD.” (Ps. 10:3). “ . . . if wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.” (Ps. 62:10b). Solomon learned from his mistakes that extreme wealth can become an idol that draws a person off their walk with God: “Keep deception and lies far from me, give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is my portion, so that I will not be full and deny You and say, ‘Who is the LORD?’ And that I will not become impoverished and steal, and profane the name of my God.” (Prov. 30:8-9). Thus, “Jesus said to His disciples, ‘Truly I say to you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.”’ (Matt. 19:23; 1 Tim. 6:10). Thus, never look upon any promise in the Bible as the means to get rich. God wants you to covet Him, not worldly wealth.</p></li>

<h2 id="a-legacy-reverent-obedience-can-lead-to-a-blessed-legacy.-ps.-1286a."><strong>6. <u>A Legacy: Reverent Obedience Can Lead to a Blessed Legacy</u>. Ps. 128:6a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in Spirit-led obedience with a blessed legacy</u>. When your faith produces the fruit of obedience, the psalmist further reveals that God offers the blessing of both a prolonged life and a blessed legacy. “<strong><sup>6a </sup></strong><em>Indeed, may you see your children’s children</em>.” (Ps. 128:6a). “May he live to a good old age and see his family perpetuated in his grandchildren.” (Alexander Kirkpatrick, on Ps. 128:6).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s blessing can include a prolonged life</u>. Through Moses, God promised that faith-led obedience can lead to a blessing of a prolonged life, where each person lives long enough to enjoy their grandchildren. “so that you, <em>your son, and your grandson will fear the LORD your God</em>, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that <em>your days may be prolonged</em>.” (Dt. 6:2). But this blessing was not limited to merely living a long life. It includes a blessed multi-generational family. This was the blessing that Israel experienced when God allowed him to see Joseph and his children. “And Israel said to Joseph, ‘I never expected to see your face, and behold, God has let me see your children as well!”’ (Gen. 48:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s blessing can include a blessed legacy</u>. The blessing of raising your children in the Lord also brings the blessing of seeing the fruit of God-fearing grandchildren. This is a legacy in God. “Grandchildren are the crown of the old, and the glory of sons is their fathers.” (Prov. 17:6). “A good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren, and the wealth of a sinner is stored up for the righteous.” (Prov. 13:22). Thus, every person should labor to ensure that his or her children and grandchildren are raised in the Lord.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s blessings can also include success for a faithful believer’s descendants</u>. God also offers to bless a person’s descendants with success: “<em>His descendants will be mighty on the earth;</em> “His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.” (Ps. 25:13). “The descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will live in it.” (Ps. 69:36). “The children of Your servants will continue, and their descendants will be established before You.” (Ps. 102:28). “His descendants will be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed<em>.”</em> (Ps. 112:2). “A righteous person who walks in his integrity— How blessed are his sons after him.” (Prov. 20:7). This can include a blessing for a person’s descendants. But it can also be the blessing of a legacy that blesses others because of your faith-led obedience.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>When you serve the Lord, He can also bless you with a spiritual legacy</u>. Those who serve out of faith-led obedience but are unable to have children can still find God’s blessing. If you spend your life serving God by helping others, you are more likely to leave a spiritual legacy. This might include sharing and teaching God’s Word and helping a sinner to repent. It might also include helping others trapped in bondage, economic disadvantage, or physical limitations. You will be honored through the lives that you help to transform to serve Him. “[T]his is also true of Christ's spiritual children by his church in successive ages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-21.htm"><u>Isaiah 59:21</u></a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="peace-reverent-obedience-allows-god-to-bless-you-with-peace.-ps.-1286b."><strong>7. <u>Peace: Reverent Obedience Allows God to Bless You With Peace</u>. Ps. 128:6b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who walk in Spirit-led obedience with His peace</u>. The psalmist concluded with a prayer for peace. “<strong><sup>6b</sup></strong> <em>Peace be upon Israel</em>!” (Ps. 128:6b). This repeats the prayer of the Sixth Song of Ascent. “<strong><sup>5b</sup></strong> <em>Peace be upon Israel</em>.” (Ps. 125:5b).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When others attack you, find peace in Jesus</u>. The struggles that Jerusalem experienced correspond with the struggles that all believers experience in the world. When you encounter conflict, Jesus offers you His peace if you turn to Him in faith. “<em>Peace I leave you, My peace I give you</em>; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that <em>in Me you may have peace</em>. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). “And all who will follow this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.” (Gal. 6:16). “For <em>He Himself is our peace</em>, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “Peace be to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 6:23). “The LORD lift up His face to you, and give you peace.” (Nu. 6:26). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11). “Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, mend your ways, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (2 Chr. 13:11). Thus, if you need peace, turn to Jesus.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who fear God by hating evil will not be shaken</u>. When you are rooted in God, the evil of the world will not pull you off from your firm foundation: “The righteous will never be shaken, but the wicked will not live in the land.” (Prov. 10:30). “I have set the LORD continually before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.” (Ps. 16:8). “For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the faithfulness of the Most High he will not be shaken.” (Ps. 21:7). “Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” (Ps. 55:22). “A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever.” (Ps. 125:1). This firm foundation in God can also lead to His peace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fear God by hating evil will not fear evil</u>. When your faith is firmly rooted in God, you also do not need to fear any evil: “But whoever listens to me will live securely and will be at ease from the dread of evil.” (Prov. 1:33). “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.” (Ps. 23:4). “In God, whose word I praise, in God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?” (Ps. 56:4). “The LORD is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me?” (Ps. 118:6). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7).</p></li>
