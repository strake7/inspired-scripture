Kings 16: Lessons from Five Wicked Kings of Northern Israel Regarding
the End Times</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter covers the reigns of five kings of
Northern Israel who ruled over 60 years. These include: (1) King Baasha
(24 years), (2) King Elah (2 years), (3) King Zimri (7 days), (4) King
Omri (12 years), and (5) King Ahab (22 years). Each king engaged in more
egregious acts of evil than his predecessor. Northern Israel’s slow
descent into darkness living under ungodly kings provides a warning to
the world. Many think that God embraces the notion of the separation
between what happens in the political realm and the Church. He doesn’t.
When a nation’s leaders live without God, they live under Satan’s
control. All of society then suffers. Life in Israel under these five
wicked kings provides a window into the end times when the nations will
also be governed by leaders who reject God’s Word and live under Satan’s
influence. During the end times, leaders and nations will live under:
(1) pride, (2) God’s judgment, (3) violence, (4) chaos, (5) strife, (6)
idolatry / apostasy, and (7) sexual immorality.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, God raised Baasha from a lowly position to be His
instrument of judgment over Jeroboam’s household. Yet, out of pride,
Baasha forgot about God and misused God’s grace to engage in the same
evil acts of idolatry as Jeroboam. In the end times, people will be like
Baasha, prideful and forgetful of God. <u>Second</u>, after Baasha
refused to repent, a servant named Zimri fulfilled God’s prophecy of
judgment against Baasha by betraying and murdering his eldest son and
successor, Elah. In the end times, God will judge wickedness, just as He
did to Baasha and his son Elah. <u>Third</u>, after Zimri murdered Elah,
he then executed all of Elah’s sons, Baasha’s extended relatives and
even people who were friends of Baasha or Elah. Each new ruler engaged
in acts of violence that exceeded the prior ruler. In the end times,
violence and hatred will also be rampant. <u>Fourth</u>, Zimri’s violent
coup gave him a reign that lasted only seven days before he was also
thrown out of power. In the end times, chaos and disorder will also be
rampant. <u>Fifth</u>, after Zimri’s death, Northern Israel was divided
for four years between Omri and Tibni. During this time, chaos continued
to reign in Northern Israel. Everyone lived in strife and misery. In the
end times, strife and misery will also be rampant. <u>Sixth</u>, while
his predecessors created golden calves in a misguided and unlawful
attempt to worship Yahweh, Omri openly worshiped the calves as their own
gods. In the end times, idolatry and apostasy will also be rampant.
<u>Finally</u>, Omri’s son Ahab continued the decline of Northern
Israel. While his father worshiped the gold calves as gods, he and his
pagan wife Jezebel openly adopted the worship of the Canaanite fertility
gods Baal and Asherah. This included Asherah poles that were used for
sexual idolatry. In the end times, sexual immorality (in far worse
forms) will also be rampant.</p>

<u>Pride: In the End Times, People Will be Prideful and Forget God</u>.
1 Kgs. 16:1-5.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s prophecy of judgment against Baasha</u>. Although God
had elevated Baasha from a lowly position to be His instrument of
judgment over Jeroboam’s household, Baasha misused God’s grace to engage
in the same evil acts of idolatry as Jeroboam. Thus, God sent a prophet
to judge both Baasha and his descendants: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now the word
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came to Jehu the son of
Hanani against Baasha, saying, <sup>2 </sup>‘Inasmuch as I exalted you
from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel, and you have
walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made My people Israel sin,
provoking Me to anger with their sins, <sup>3 </sup>behold, I will
consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <sup>4 </sup>Anyone of Baasha who dies in
the city the dogs will eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the
birds of the heavens will eat.’ <sup>5 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of
Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the Book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</em>?” (1 Kgs. 16:1-5). God
sent the prophet Jehu from Judah to judge Baasha. He was also active
during Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah (2 Chron. 19:1-3). This likely
means that God could not find a messenger in all of Northern Israel who
would convey His message. Being from Judah, Jehu risked death by
crossing into Northern Israel to judge an adversarial king. During
Baasha’s 24-year reign, 909-866 B.C., he caused all of Northern Israel
to sin. To maintain his grip on power, he preserved the idolatrous
system of worship with golden calves started under Jeroboam. At the same
time, he prevented observant Jews from reaching the Temple for worship
by creating a blockade in Ramah (1 Kgs. 15:17). Thus, Baasha seized
power solely to glorify himself, and he imprisoned others in a
counterfeit religion.</p></li>
<li><p><u>To guide His lost people, God sent His prophets to bring His
people to repent</u>. Because God loves His people, He sent prophets to
guide His people when His leaders went astray. Some of the most
important prophets when Israel was divided included Elijah, Elisha,
Micaiah, and Huldah. But He also sent lesser known prophets like Jehu
and Ahijah (1 Kgs. 14:7-16) to warn His people. Unlike the many false
prophets who opposed them, God’s true prophets only spoke His Word. And
with every prophecy uttered by His prophets, God’s Word came to pass (2
Kings 17:5-6; 25:1-11). Through their righteous examples, the prophets
during the time period of the kings set the stage for the prophets
during exile, like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who would prepare the people
for the coming Messiah, Jesus. Today, God has left you with His Word and
His Spirit to guide you when your leaders embrace evil and lead the
nations astray.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Baasha ignored prior warning of judgment</u>. The prophet
Ahijah previously warned that God would raise up a king who would
overthrow Jeroboam’s evil kingdom. (1 Kgs. 14:10-11, 14). God fulfilled
that prophecy when He allowed Baasha to depose Nadab and kill every
living descendant of Jeroboam (1 Kgs. 15:27-30). Thus, because God used
him to judge Jeroboam and Nadab, Baasha knew that God does not tolerate
evil. Yet, out of pride, he assumed that he was in control and
responsible for his kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God judged Baasha for his pride</u>. Through his pride, Baasha
committed one of the sins that God “hates”: “ . . . pride and arrogance
and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). Because
Baasha exalted himself, God promised to humble him. “Whoever exalts
himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.”
(Matt. 23:12). “When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence,
and the humble person He will save.” (Job 22:29). “But He gives a
greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but
gives grace to the humble.’” (Jam. 4:6). Because Baasha’s pride would
not let him repent, it led to the destruction of his kingdom and his
entire family: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit
before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18). “A man’s pride will bring him low, . .
.” (Prov. 29:23). His pride deceived him into thinking that he was
entitled to assume the throne: ‘“ . . . The arrogance of your heart has
deceived you,’ . . . declares the LORD.” (Jer. 49:16). Like Baasha, when
you are prideful, your heart will also deceive you into doing foolish
things.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign and can remove any evil government</u>. God
told Baasha that He was sovereign and elevated Baasha from “dust” to
give him the throne (1 Kgs. 16:2). Daniel explained: “It is He who
changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes
kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of
understanding.” (Da. 2:21). “He makes the nations great, then destroys
them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23).
“Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as
a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine
dust.” (Is. 40:15). “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are
regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17). “The
LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.”
(Ps. 10:16). “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their
gladness; . . .” (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of the earth are
accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of
heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His
hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35). Even when you
see evil in every branch and level of government, do you trust that God
is sovereign over evil leaders?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God by heeding His Word and hating evil</u>. Baasha did
not fear God because he did not believe in God’s Word: “The fear of the
LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and
instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:10; 15:33; Ps. 111:10; Job 28:28; Ecc.
12:13). He also did not fear God because he did not hate evil: “The fear
of the LORD is to hate evil; . . .” (Prov. 8:13). “ . . . and by the
fear of the LORD one keeps away from evil.” (Prov. 16:6). Do you hate
what God defines in His Word as evil?</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, people will also be blinded by their vanity
and pride</u>. Like Baasha, people during the end times will become
arrogant and vain: “For men will be <em>lovers of self</em>, lovers of
money, <em>boastful, arrogant</em>, revilers, disobedient to parents,
ungrateful, unholy,” (2 Tim. 3:2). “For they all seek after their own
interests, not those of Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 2:21). Ask God to show you
where you are self-absorbed or vain.</p></li>

<u>God’s Judgment: In the End Times, God Will Judge Wickedness</u>. 1
Kgs. 16:6-10.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Zimri fulfills God’s prophecy of judgment against Baasha by
killing his son Elah</u>. After Baasha refused to repent, a servant
named Zimri fulfilled God’s prophesy judgment against Baasha by
betraying and murdering his eldest son and successor, Elah:
“<sup>6 </sup><em>And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in
Tirzah, and Elah his son became king in his place.
<sup>7 </sup>Moreover, the word of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
also came against Baasha and his household, both because of all the evil
which he did in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the
house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it. <sup>8 </sup>In the
twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became
king over Israel at Tirzah, and reigned two years. <sup>9 </sup>His
servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him.
Now he was at Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who
was over the household at Tirzah. <sup>10 </sup>Then Zimri went in and
struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king
of Judah, and became king in his place</em>.” (1 Kgs. 16:6-10). Baasha
died a natural death (1 Kgs. 16:6). This did not mean that God had
forgiven him. Instead, it showed God’s mercy and grace in withholding
His judgment to give Baasha an opportunity to repent. Because Baasha
refused to repent, God allowed a wicked commander named Zimri to carry
out His judgment upon Elah and his descendants.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God showed mercy and grace before judging Elah</u>. Before
judging Elah, God allowed him to reign for two years (1 Kgs. 16:8),
886-885 B.C. God also gave Nadab exactly two years to repent after
succeeding Jeroboam before God judged him (1 Kings 15:25). This again
showed that God acted with mercy and grace to give both Nadab and Elah a
chance to repent. Yet, both squandered this chance and instead pursued
after the same idolatry as their fathers. Both were betrayed and killed
by servants seeking to usurp their power. Elah was also believed to be a
drunkard. His commander Zimri knew this and conspired with others to
betray and murder Elah while he was intoxicated (1 Kgs. 16:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Deceit is a sign of a person acting under Satan’s
influence</u>. By employing deceit to kill Elah, Zimri put himself under
the devil’s control. Lies and deceit are Satan’s tools to turn people
away from God (Dt. 11:16; 30:17). If you deceive or lie, you are also
under Satan’s influence. “<em>You are of your father the devil, and you
want to do the desires of your father</em>. . . Whenever he speaks a
lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of
lies.” (Jo. 8:44). Are there any lies or deceit in your walk with
God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wages of sin are death</u>. Elah died because of his
father Baasha’s sins. God’s punishment of Elah should not be dismissed
as a relic of the Old Testament. “For the wages of sin is death, . .”
(Rom. 6:23). For the unsaved, allowing demonic forces into your life
through drug abuse, alcohol, pornography, or the occult brings with it
an eternal death penalty (Lev. 20:27; Ex. 22:18; Dt. 18:10-12). Only
through faith in Jesus’ atoning death on the cross is salvation possible
(Rom. 3:25; 2 Cor. 5:21). “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our
behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2
Cor. 5:21). “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a
curse for us, . . .” (Gal. 3:13). “for ‘whoever will call on the name of
the Lord will be saved.”’ (Ro. 10:13). How seriously are you taking your
sins?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t ignore God’s warnings of judgment</u>. No person should
treat sin lightly (Rom. 6:26). God is a consuming fire when in the
presence of sin: “for our God is a consuming fire.” (Heb. 12:29; 10:27;
Ex. 24:17; Dt. 4:24; 9:3; Ps. 97:3; Is. 33:14; 2 Thess. 1:7). For those
who do not repent, He warns: “I will pour out My indignation on you; I
will blow on you with the fire of My wrath, . . .” (Ez. 21:31(a)). ‘“Is
not My word like fire?’ declares the LORD, ‘and like a hammer which
shatters a rock?’” (Jer. 23:29). “The soul who sins will die.” (Ez.
18:4(b)). Unless you accept that God will judge sin, you will feel no
pressure to repent. Staying silent about His judgments also doesn’t help
others. Are you helping others turn to Christ to spare them from
judgment? (Matt. 28:16-20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s warnings of judgment are true and are fulfilled when
sinners refuse to repent</u>. Throughout the Bible, God reveals that His
Word is true and always comes to pass: “Not one of the good promises
which the LORD had made to the house of Israel failed; all came to
pass.” (Josh. 21:45). “Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His
people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has
failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His
servant.” (1 Kgs. 8:56). “I declared the former things long ago and they
went forth from My mouth, and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I acted, and
they came to pass.” (Is. 48:3). “Behold, the former things have come to
pass, now I declare new things; before they spring forth I proclaim them
to you.” (Is. 42:9). No other holy book can make similar claims of
fulfilled prophecy as the Bible does. Thus, non-believers ignore God’s
warnings of judgment at their own peril.</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, God will judge the unrepentant nations for
their evil acts</u>. During the end times there will initially be a
period of peace when the people will celebrate their attempt to live
without God. The same was likely true under the reign of Jeroboam. He
reigned for 22 years (1 Kgs. 14:20). During this time, many likely
believed that they could break away from God’s religious order and
worship Him through golden calves without consequence. Yet, God would
eventually judge Northern Israel. During the end times, the nations will
initially enjoy a period of peace under the counterfeit religious order
of the antichrist. Yet, this will merely be the calm before the storm of
judgments that God will unleash on the unholy nations (Rev. 8:7-13;
16:4; 9:1-11; 16:3-21).</p></li>

<u>Violence: In the End Times, Violence and Hatred will be Rampant</u>.
1 Kgs. 16:11-14.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fulfillment of God’s prophecy against Baasha’s
descendants</u>. Baasha showed no mercy when he violently murdered all
Jeroboam’s descendants. God allowed Baasha’s descendants to be judged by
the same standard that Baasha used to judge his rivals:
“<sup>11 </sup><em>It came about when he became king, as soon as he sat
on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not
leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.
<sup>12 </sup>Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha,
according to the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, which
He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet, <sup>13 </sup>for all
the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and
which they made Israel sin, provoking the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel to anger with their idols.
<sup>14 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are
they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Israel?</em>” (1 Kgs. 16:11-14). After Zimri murdered Elah, he then
executed all of Elah’s sons. To eliminate any future rivals, he then
executed Baasha’s extended relatives. He then went a step further than
Baasha by executing people for the mere fact that they were once friends
of Baasha or Elah (1 Kgs. 16:11). This continued a vicious cycle of
violence. Each new ruler engaged in acts of violence that exceeded the
prior ruler.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Baasha reaped what he sowed</u>. God’s prophecy against
Jeroboam and Nadab was limited to their living male descendants (1 Kgs.
14:10-11, 14). Baasha did not fulfill God’s prophecy to serve God.
Instead, he acted with cruelty to serve his own needs. He went beyond
the prophecy to kill every woman and child as well (1 Kgs. 15:27-30). He
then turned his back on God by preserving the system of idolatry that
God condemned. He, his family, and all of Northern Israel reaped the
evil that he sowed: “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever
a man sows, this he will also reap.” (Gal. 6:7). “For they sow the wind
and they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it yields
no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up.” (Hos.
8:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will judge you by the standards that you use to judge
others</u>. Normally, God will not allow a son to die because of a
father’s sins: “Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor
shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to
death for his own sin.” (Dt. 24:16; Ezek. 18:20). Yet, God judged
Baasha’s descendants with the same standard that Baasha used to judge
Jeroboam’s descendants: “Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you
who passes judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn
yourself; for you who judge practice the same things . . . . But do you
suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on those who practice such
things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of
God?” (Ro. 2:1-3). “Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For in
the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure,
it will be measured to you. ‘Why do you look at the speck that is in
your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?’
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your
eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take
the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the
speck out of your brother's eye.” (Matt. 7:1-5). “And He was saying to
them, ‘Take care what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will
be measured to you; and more will be given you besides.”’ (Mk. 4:24). If
you are gossiping against and judging others, God may judge you by the
same standards.</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, people will be unforgiving and violent
toward each other</u>. In the end times, God’s teachings of mercy and
forgiveness will be ignored. Like Baasha, people will become “without
understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;” (Ro. 1:31). When
God’s love and mercy is removed, the end times will be filled with acts
of violence, wrath, vengeance, hatred, and betrayal, the same way Baasha
treated his rivals.</p></li>

Kgs. 16:15-20.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fulfillment of God’s prophecy of instability through
Zimri’s overthrow</u>. Zimri’s victory from his violent coup gave him a
reign that lasted only “seven days” before he was also thrown out of
power: “<sup>15 </sup><em>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of
Judah, Zimri reigned seven days at Tirzah. Now the people were camped
against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. <sup>16 </sup>The
people who were camped heard it said, ‘Zimri has conspired and has also
struck down the king.’ Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of
the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. <sup>17 </sup>Then Omri
and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
<sup>18 </sup>When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the
citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with
fire, and died, <sup>19 </sup>because of his sins which he sinned, doing
evil in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, walking in
the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, making Israel sin.
<sup>20 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which
he carried out, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of
the Kings of Israel?</em>” (1 Kgs. 16:15-20). Zimri’s seven-day reign
(885 B.C.), was the shortest of any king of either Israel or Judah.
Zimri seized power during a battle between the Jews and the Philistines
at Gibbethon. Members of the 10 tribes of Northern Israel had no
interest in allowing Zimri to govern them. Thus, they picked another
military leader named Omri to challenge him. Yet, Omri would continue
the vicious cycle of leaders who engaged in evil acts that surpassed
their predecessors. To avoid being captured, Zimri let himself suffer
one of the most painful deaths possible by allowing himself to be burned
alive in his palace.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Satan’s goal is to create chaos</u>. Satan’s goal has always
been to break down order through rebellion. His goal is to create chaos
and misery. Satan first led a third of the angels in rebellion against
God’s rule (Rev. 12:3-9). He then led Eve to rebel against God’s rules
(Gen. 3:1-4). He then lead Adam and Eve to rebel against each other
(Gen. 3:16). Satan also becomes the father of those who rebel (Jo.
8:44). Jesus once quoted a prophesy: “I will strike down the shepherd,
and the sheep shall be scattered.” (Mk. 14:23). When influenced by
Satan, the corrupt “despise authority.” (2 Pet. 2:10). Solomon later
said that rebellion was the sign of an “evil man.” (Prov. 17:11).
According to Paul, rebellion is also part of the spirit of “the prince
of the power of the air.” (Eph. 2:2). Samuel also said that: “. . .
rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft . . .” (1 Sam. 15:23). After
leaving Egypt, the Jews’ lack of faith caused them to repeatedly rebel
against God and His appointed leader Moses (Nu. 14:22). As a result of
the Jews’ repeated refusal to obey and have faith, God eventually
banished them to spend 40 years wandering in the desert (Nu. 14:34). For
everything good and holy, Satan has created a counterfeit to deceive
people. If God’s perfect government leads to peace and harmony (1 Tim.
2:1-2), rebellion only brings strife, death, and misery. For those who
follow Satan, he further deceives them. He turns his own leaders on each
other to sow misery.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The future fulfillment of God’s judgment of political
instability</u>. Within a short period of time, Omri set up Northern
Israel’s third dynasty. The constant instability in Northern Israel also
fulfilled a prophecy of God’s judgment. The prophet Ahijah prophesied
that the people of Northern Israel would be like a “a reed is shaken in
the water.” (1 Kgs. 14:15). This was a metaphor for instability (Matt.
11:7; Lk. 7:24). Omri’s coup was the second coup, following Zimri’s coup
(1 Kgs. 15:28) to fulfill this prophecy of judgment. God judged each and
every one of the leaders of Northern Israel for their evil acts (1 Kgs.
15:34; 16:2, 19, 31; 22:52; 2 Kgs. 3:3; 10:29, 31; 13:2, 11; 14:24;
15:9, 18, 24, 28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, chaos will also be pervasive in society</u>.
The anarchy that followed Elah being overthrown provides a window into
the end times. His reign lasted seven days. Some believe that the
antichrist will reign during the end times, for 7 years. Others believe
that it will only be 3 and ½ years. Under either scenario, it will be
short. The last half of the seven years will be filled with chaos during
the Great Tribulation. “<sup>28 </sup>The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will smite you with madness and with
blindness and with bewilderment of heart; <sup>29 </sup>and you will
grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, and you will not
prosper in your ways; but you shall only be oppressed and robbed
continually, with none to save you.” (Dt. 28:27-29; Ex. 10:21). “We
grope along the wall like blind men, we grope like those who have no
eyes; we stumble at midday as in the twilight, . . .” (Is. 59:10(a)).
“By day they meet with darkness, and grope at noon as in the night.”
(Job 5:14; 12:25; 38:15). “They wandered, blind, in the streets; . .”
(Lam. 4:14(a); Amos 8:9). “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they
do not know over what they stumble.” (Prov. 4:19). During the end times,
people will be spiritually blind and numb to their sins. They will know
their suffering. But they will be oblivious to the solution.</p></li>

<li><p><u>The fulfillment of God’s prophecy of instability through
Israel’s civil war</u>. As an additional fulfillment of God’s prophecy
of instability, Northern Israel then suffered a civil war:
“<sup>21 </sup><em>Then the people of Israel were divided into two
parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him
king; the other half followed Omri. <sup>22 </sup>But the people who
followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of
Ginath. And Tibni died and Omri became king.</em>” (1 Kgs. 16:21-22).
After Zimri’s death, Northern Israel was divided for four years between
Omri and Tibni. During this time, chaos continued to reign in Northern
Israel. Everyone lived in strife and misery.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Satan stirs up evil leaders to create strife amongst God’s
peoples</u>. The strife between the Jews in Northern Israel was a result
of their leaders’ evil desires for self-aggrandizement and power. As
they lived without God, these leaders lived under Satan’s control and
caused strife and misery: “An arrogant man stirs up strife, but he who
trusts in the LORD will prosper.” (Prov. 28:25.) A person who causes
strife amongst God’s people is one of the things that God “hates”:
“There are six things which the LORD hates, . . . A false witness who
utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.” (Prov. 6:16,
19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>During the end times, the people will also live in strife
against each other</u>. When order under Satan’s rule breaks down,
society becomes chaotic, hateful, and violent. “For we also once were
foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and
pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one
another.” (Titus 3:3). When God’s people turn on each other in strife,
it is a sign that He has removed His hand of protection and Satan is in
full control: “<sup>53 </sup>Then you shall eat the offspring of your
own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters whom the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has given you, during the siege
and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you.” (Dt. 28:53).
“Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your
daughters you will eat.” (Lev. 26:29). “I will make them eat the flesh
of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one
another’s flesh in the siege and in the distress with which their
enemies and those who seek their life will distress them.” (Jer. 19:9).
“They slice off what is on the right hand but still are hungry, and they
eat what is on the left hand but they are not satisfied; each of them
eats the flesh of his own arm.” (Is. 9:20). “The hands of compassionate
women boiled their own children; they became food for them because of
the destruction of the daughter of my people.” (Lam. 4:10). “Therefore,
fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat their fathers;
for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnant to
every wind.” (Ezek. 5:10). These verses should not be read as acts of
cannibalism. Instead, they represent the curse of having people who were
once family and friends turn on each other in acts of cruel violence and
strife.</p></li>

Rampant</u>. 1 Kgs. 16:23-28.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Omri acts more wickedly than any prior king</u>. As part
of Northern Israel’s downward slide into darkness, Omri engaged in acts
that were more evil than any predecessor. This included pagan worship:
“<sup>23 </sup><em>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri
became king over Israel and reigned twelve years; he reigned six years
at Tirzah. <sup>24 </sup>He bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two
talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and named the city which he
built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
<sup>25 </sup>Omri did evil in the sight of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and acted more wickedly than all who were
before him. <sup>26 </sup>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat and in his sins which he made Israel sin, provoking the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel with their idols.
<sup>27 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his
might which he showed, are they not written in the Book of the
Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? <sup>28 </sup>So Omri slept with his
fathers and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son became king in his
place</em>.” (1 Kgs. 16:23-28). After Omri consolidated power, he
reigned over Northern Israel for 12 years from 885 to 874 B.C. (1 Kgs.
16:23). He made Samaria Northern Israel’s capital, located 7 miles
northwest of Shechem. It was defensible from attack because it was on a
hill. It remained the capital until Assyria destroyed it and sent the
Jews into exile in 722 B.C. Although his reign was short, he did more
damage to the Jews than any king before him. The evil acts of Omri and
his descendants covers a third of the two books of the Kings (1 Kgs.
16:23 - 2 Kgs. 13:25). While his predecessors created golden calves in a
misguided and unlawful attempt to worship Yahweh, Omri openly worshiped
the calves as their own gods. His descendants then openly adopted the
worship of the Canaanite god Baal. Their influence eventually corrupted
Judah’s royal families (2 Kgs. 8:18, 25- 27). Because of their evil
acts, God eventually judged both Israel and then Judah. Both were sent
into exile and captivity (2 Kgs. 9:14 - 12:21).</p></li>

Northern Israel<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The imposition of idolatrous kings was a sign of God’s
judgment</u>. God would later condemn the Jews for following statutes
for pagan worship that Omri started and his son Ahab perfected: “<em>The
statutes of Omri</em> <em>and all the works of the house of Ahab are
observed; and in their devices you walk</em>. Therefore I will give you
up for destruction and your inhabitants for derision, and you will bear
the reproach of My people.” (Micah 6:16). God’s punishment would
continue during the Jews’ future captivity in exile: “<sup>36 </sup>The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will bring you and your king, whom
you set over you, to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have
known, and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone.” (Dt.
28:36). “There [in captivity] you will serve gods, the work of man’s
hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.”
(Dt. 4:28). “It shall come about when they say, ‘Why has the LORD our
God done all these things to us?’ then you shall say to them, ‘As you
have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve
strangers in a land that is not yours.”’ (Jer. 5:19). ‘“So I will hurl
you out of this land into the land which you have not known, neither you
nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, for
I will grant you no favor.”’ (Jer. 16:13). If the Jews wanted to live
like pagans, God would let them be ruled under true pagans.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worshiping anything other than God can bring curses to you and
your descendants</u>. God’s anger burned against Israel when they
worshiped other gods: “So they forsook the LORD and served Baal and the
Ashtaroth. The anger of the LORD burned against Israel . . .” (Jdgs.
2:13-15). God repeatedly commanded the Jews not to turn to idols (Ex.
20:4, 23; 34:17; Lev. 19:4; 26:1; Dt. 4:16, 23; 2 Kin. 17:12; Ps. 78:58;
Ez. 20:7). This prohibition is repeated in the New Testament. “<em>Do
not be idolaters</em>, as some of them were; as it is written, “The
people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.” (1 Cor. 10:7).
The prohibition against idolatry is one of the three prohibitions from
the Old Testament mentioned in the Apostolic Decree (Acts 15:28-29; same
21:25). Paul lists it as one of the deeds of the flesh (Gal. 5:19-21).
As part of the Second Commandment, God warned that idolatry is so
serious that it can bring judgment upon both you and future generations
(Ex. 20:4-6; Dt. 5:8-10). Because the Jews ignored repeated
opportunities to repent, God removed His hedge of protection and allowed
Satan to lead the Jews into captivity: “Then the sons of Israel again
did evil in the sight of the LORD, served the Baals and the Ashtaroth .
. . The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He sold them into
the hands of the Philistines . . . so that Israel was greatly distressed
. . .” (Jdgs. 10:6-14). “But if you or your sons indeed turn away from
following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I
have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, then
I will cut off Israel . . .” (1 Kgs. 9:6-7; Ex. 20:5; Dt. 5:9). False
gods will inevitably disappoint. Only worshiping God will give you the
peace that surpasses all understanding (Phil. 4:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, people will openly embrace apostasy</u>. In
the end times, leaders will also reject God’s Word and publicly shame
and accuse those who follow God for allegedly being intolerant bigots.
“But the Spirit explicitly says that <em>in later times some will fall
away from the faith</em>, <em>paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons</em>,” (1 Tim. 4:1). “But false prophets also arose
among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you,
who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the
Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.” (2
Pet. 2:1). Are you voting for leaders who will uphold God’s laws and His
standards of morality?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>King Ahab acts even more wickedly than any prior king</u>.
Omri’s son Ahab continued the decline of Northern Israel. While his
father worshiped the gold calves as gods, he and his pagan wife Jezebel
openly adopted the worship of the Canaanite fertility gods Baal and
Asherah: “<sup>29 </sup><em>Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over
Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, and Ahab the son
of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
<sup>30 </sup>Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> more than all who were before him.
<sup>31 </sup>It came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for
him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he married
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went to serve
Baal and worshiped him. <sup>32 </sup>So he erected an altar for Baal in
the house of Baal which he built in Samaria. <sup>33 </sup>Ahab also
made the Asherah. Thus Ahab did more to provoke the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel than all the kings of Israel
who were before him. <sup>34 </sup>In his days Hiel the Bethelite built
Jericho; he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,
and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according
to the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, which He spoke
by Joshua the son of Nun</em>.” (1 Kgs. 16:29-34). King Ahab reigned for
22 years, from 874-853 B.C. (1 Kgs. 16:29). His reign was equal in
length to King Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:20). This was meant to draw a
parallel between the two. While Jeroboam was the father of idolatry,
Ahab was the father of Baal worship in Israel. Just as Jeroboam activity
promoted the worship of golden calves, Ahab actively promoted the
worship of the gods Baal and Asherah (1 Kgs. 18:1-19:18). He then
compounded his evil by threatening God’s prophets (1 Kgs. 18:1-6;
19:1-2), and hiring 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah (1
Kgs. 18:22). As one commentator explains: Jeroboam intended to serve the
Lord through idolatrous images (such as the golden calf) and in
disobedient ways (altars and high places other than Jerusalem). Ahab
introduced the worship of completely new, pagan gods. In his
disobedience Jeroboam said, ‘I will worship the Lord, but do it my way.’
Ahab said, ‘I want to forget about the Lord completely and worship
Baal.’” (David Guzik on 1 Kgs. 16).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"
class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> For these and
other evil acts, <em>“Ahab did more to provoke the <span

who were before him.</em>” (1 Kgs. 16:33).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Ahab’s Baal worship also introduced sexual immorality into
worship</u>. The Canaanites worshiped Baal to provide the rain to
fertilize their farmlands. The fertility goddess Asherah was the sexual
consort of Baal. The Asherah poles were sexual poles that were also
meant to promote sex and fertility. Moses repeatedly warned the Jews
about polluting their worship with these pagan sexual poles:
<sup>21 </sup>“You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind
of tree beside the altar of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your
God, which you shall make for yourself. <sup>22 </sup>You shall not set
up for yourself a sacred pillar which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God hates.” (Dt. 16:21; 7:5; 12:1-3;
Ex. 34:13). The Jews were frequently tempted to worship both God and
Baal in the misguided belief that they increased their chances that
someone would hear their prayers: “The sons of Israel did what was evil
in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God and served the
Baals and the Asheroth.” (Jdgs. 3:7; 2:11, 2:13; 10:6, 10). Gideon
became the first to fight against the infestation of Asherah poles when
chopped down his father’s Asherah pole (Jdgs. 6:25-27). Yet, the Jews
remained attracted to this sexual idolatry: “They cried out to the LORD
and said, ‘We have sinned because we have forsaken the LORD and have
served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hands of
our enemies, and we will serve You.”’ (1 Sam. 12:10). Ahab brought this
evil out of the shadows by making this part of an official
state-sanctioned religion. Ahab married the pagan Jezebel to form an
alliance with the Phoenicians. This act of short-term gain was
disastrous for all the Jews. She seduced Ahab into adopting this
counterfeit religion. She would come to symbolize those who seduce God’s
people into turning away from Him: “But I have this against you, that
you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she
teaches and leads My bond-servants astray so that they commit acts of
immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.” (Rev. 2:20). She also
introduced the Asherah poles. The people’s demand for these sexual poles
later prompted King Manasseh to place Asherah poles in God’s Temple in
Jerusalem (2 Kgs. 21:7). The inclusion of these sexual poles in the
Jews’ worship represented an open embrace of the idol of sexual
immorality. Although people don’t use these poles today, sexual
immorality is an even bigger idol today.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Ahab rebuilt Satan’s wall of imprisonment that God had ripped
down</u>. Ahab also rebuilt the city of Jericho (1 Kgs. 16:34). Joshua
destroyed and burned the ruins of Jericho hundreds of years earlier
(Josh. 6:20-21). He then cursed anyone who would try to rebuild it:
“Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, ‘Cursed before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the man who rises up and
builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay
its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up
its gates.’” (Josh. 6:26). Here, Joshua’s curse was fulfilled when Ahab
tried to rebuild the city of Jericho. As a partial fulfillment of this
curse, the builder Hiel lost his sons while trying to lay the
foundations (1 Kgs. 16:34). Satan is always looking to rebuild a
stronghold of evil in your life. Sometimes you place the blocks down
without realizing that they will become the wall that Satan will use to
entrap you. Are you staying clear from the cursed things of this world
that Satan may use to entrap you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>In the end times, people will openly embrace sexual
immorality</u>. During the end times, people will also openly engage in
sexual immorality. “Know this first of all, that in the last days
mockers will come with their mocking, <em>following after their own
lusts</em>,” (2 Pet. 3:3). Instead of poles, people can now embrace
sexual immorality through nearly every part of civil life. Moreover,
sexual practices that God condemned are now openly celebrated. Yet,
although not politically popular to hear, God warns: “Woe to those who
call evil good, and good evil; . . .” (Is. 5:20). These are all signs of
the end times.</p></li>
