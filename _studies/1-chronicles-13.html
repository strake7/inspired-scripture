<p><u>Introduction</u>: Many people know the story of a man named Uzzah, who died from touching God’s ark. But many sadly point to this account to draw some misguided distinction between God in the Old and New Testaments. Many use this account to incorrectly portray God in the Old Testament as wrathful. This common misinterpretation is incorrect. This story is about David’s attempt to restore proper worship in Israel before God’s ark. From this chapter, God reveals seven lessons on the meaning of true worship. True worship includes: (1) fellowship, (2) prayer, (3) obedience, (4) praise, (5) reverence, (6) Jesus as your mediator, and (7) blessings.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the ark (which included God’s Word), remained hidden during all of Saul’s reign. David sought to restore true worship by returning the ark (God’s Word) to the Tabernacle. He sought out God’s fellowship by having His people be in God’s presence through His Word. God also wants you to seek out His fellowship through His Word. <u>Second</u>, although the Jews wanted to be in God’s presence, they failed to seek God’s guidance in how to bring back the ark. Instead, they did what seemed right in their own eyes. From their mistake, God reveals that true worship includes prayer for His guidance. <u>Third</u>, the Jews also failed to properly transport the ark in the manner that God ordained. From the Jews’ mistakes, God reveals that true worship begins by obeying His Word. <u>Fourth</u>, David led the Jews in joyful worship. God also wants your worship to include praise, sacrifice, and celebration for Jesus. <u>Fifth</u>, because the Jews transported the ark incorrectly with an animal cart instead of poles, it almost fell. To protect the ark, a man named Uzzah used his hands to keep the ark from falling. Yet, he died because he ignored God’s warning that death would come to anyone who touched His holy ark. From his error, God reveals that true worship includes reverence. <u>Sixth</u>, David feared God after he realized his sins and questioned how God’s Word could be brought to him. All have sinned and face the same dilemma. From this, God reveals that true worship recognizes the need for His only mediator, Jesus. <u>Finally</u>, God blessed a man’s family when he agreed to properly store the ark. When you worship Jesus in faith-led obedience, Jesus also promises to bless you in your walk with Him.</p>

<li><p><u>David encourages his leaders to seek out God’s presence through the ark</u>. After becoming king, taking Israel’s capital, and defeating the Philistines in battle, David’s next act was a noble one. After decades of living without the ark during Saul’s reign, David wanted to bring the ark to Israel’s new capital so that God could guide all of Israel: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and the hundreds, even with every leader. <sup>2 </sup>David said to all the assembly of Israel, ‘If it seems good to you, and if it is from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, let us send everywhere to our kinsmen who remain in all the land of Israel, also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities with pasture lands, that they may meet with us; <sup>3 </sup>and let us bring back the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul</em>.’” (1 Chr. 13:1-3; 2 Sam. 6:1). After God punished the Jews for misusing the ark as a good luck charm in battle, the Jews stored it in the house of Abinadab and consecrated a priest named Eleazar to protect it (1 Sam. 7:1). The ark remained there for all of Saul’s reign (1 Sam. 7:2). In seeking to bring back the ark, David conceded with a humble heart that the Jews had not sought after God while it remained hidden during Saul’s reign (1 Chr. 13:3-4). The ark was meant to bring the people into fellowship with God for Him to bless them. As the King of Israel, this was one of the most important things that David did for God’s people.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God ordered the Jews to build the ark so that He could dwell with His people</u>. The ark was not meant to be hidden from Israel. It was important for David to retrieve the ark because it was from the mercy seat that God promised to speak to Israel’s high priest: “<em>There I will meet with you</em>; and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, <em>I will speak to you</em> about all that I will give you in commandment for the sons of Israel.” (Ex. 25:22; 29:43; 30:6; Lev. 1:1; 16:2; Nu. 7:89; 17:4; 1 Sam. 4:4; 1 Chron. 13:6; Ps. 80:1). God further ordered the Jews to build the ark and the sanctuary around it so that He could dwell with His people: “<sup>8 </sup>Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, <em>that I may dwell among them</em>. <sup>9 </sup>According to all that I am going to show you, as the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture, just so you shall construct it.” (Ex. 25:8-9). A “<em>Mishken</em>” or Tabernacle is the noun form of the Hebrew word “<em>shachan</em>”, which means to lodge or dwell. God wanted to dwell with His people the way a husband dwells with his wife. When Jesus became flesh, He “dwelt (“<em>shachan</em>”) amongst us.” (Jo. 1:14). He currently dwells in the hearts of believers. In heaven, He dwells with His bride (the Church) (Rev. 19:7). Like David, God wants you to seek Him out so that He can speak to you through His Word.</p></li>

<h2 id="prayer-true-worship-includes-prayer-for-gods-guidance.-1-chr.-134-5.">2. <u>Prayer: True Worship Includes Prayer for God’s Guidance</u>. 1 Chr. 13:4-5.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews did what seemed right in their eyes and failed to consult God</u>. Without seeking God’s Will, the Jews agreed to transport the ark in the manner that seemed right to them: “<sup>4 </sup><em>Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. <sup>5 </sup>So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim</em>.” (1 Chr. 13:4-5). David took the ark from either “Kiriath-jearim” or “Baale-judah” (1 Chr. 13:5; 2 Sam 6:2). But David and the Jews erred in failing to seek God’s will first. “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man is he who listens to counsel.” (Prov. 12:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek God’s guidance through His Word</u>. The Jews should have known to consult God’s Word in guiding their decisions. God’s Word is meant to be a lamp to guide your steps. “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). “So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:19). The Holy Spirit also takes the Word and applies it to the unique circumstances of your life to guide your path. “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13). Are you reading the Word and praying for the Holy Spirit to guide your steps?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also hears the prayers of the humble, the faithful, and those who do His will</u>. God also promises to hear the prayers of the humble, those who fear Him, those who do His will and the righteous: “O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear” (Ps. 10:17). “He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry and will save them.” (Ps. 145:19). “The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and His ears are open to their cry.” (Ps. 34:15). “The LORD is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” (Prov. 15:29). “For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” (1 Pet. 3:12). “We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.” (Jo. 9:31). God will reward you when you live in faith-led obedience. Among other things, He will hear your prayers to Him when you cry out for guidance.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews ignore God’s Word and improperly transport God’s holy ark on a cart</u>. In their haste to transport the ark, the Jews decided to transport the ark in a cart: “<sup>6 </sup><em>David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> who is enthroned above the cherubim, where His name is called. <sup>7 </sup>They carried the ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart</em>.” (1 Chr. 13:6-7; 2 Sam. 6:2-4). In the similar account of this incident, “<em>Ahio was walking ahead of the ark.</em>” (2 Sam. 6:4). Under either account, the Jews should not have used a cart with animals to transport the holy ark.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Live in obedience to God’s Word</u>. God ordered the Jews to build the ark with two poles made of acacia or shittim wood for carrying the ark. The poles were meant to allow for the ark to be transported on the shoulders of men (Ex. 25:14-15). God further decreed that only the sons of Kohath from the tribe of Levite could transport the ark: “When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that <em>the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die</em>. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.” (Nu. 4:15). The Jews ignored these rules and transported the ark on an animal cart (2 Sam. 6:3). The result was disaster. David later admonished the priests for their errors, they correctly transported the ark: “The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.” (1 Chr. 15:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t let worldly traditions influence your worship</u>. The Jews had seen the Philistines transport the ark using animals and a cart (1 Sam. 6:10-11). If the Jews believed that it was acceptable for them to transport the ark in this manner because the Philistines had done so, they drew the wrong conclusion. God allowed the ark to be removed from the Philistines in this manner because the Jews had done nothing to rescue it. Believers today often look to what is acceptable amongst non-believers and carnal Christians in deciding how to practice their faith. Yet, believers should never let public opinion and the doctrines of mankind influence their worship. ‘“But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.”’ (Matt. 15:9; Mk. 7:7; Col. 2:22; Is. 29:13). Do you let public opinion or human traditions take precedence over God’s Word?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey God’s Word as it is written, not how you think it should be written</u>. When Moses gave the Law, he warned the Jews to follow it without deviating from it in any way: “So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.” (Dt. 5:32). “and do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.” (Dt. 28:14). “Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:7). “Do not turn to the right nor to the left; turn your foot from evil.” (Prov. 4:27). Josiah was remembered as one of the Jews greatest kings because he “<em>did</em> [not] <em>turn aside to the right or to the left</em>.” (2 Kgs. 22:2). If you pick and choose to follow the parts of Jesus’ Word that you agree with, He is not Lord over your life.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David leads the Jews in joyful worship before God</u>. David celebrated as they brought back the ark: “<sup>8 </sup><em>David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, even with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals and with trumpets</em>.” (1 Chr. 13:8; 2 Sam. 6:5). Being within God’s presence was a reason for the Jews to celebrate.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His Word and His deliverance</u>. David worshiped Yahweh with gratitude for all of His blessings. Like David, God wants you to praise Him in song as your rock, your strength, and the source of your salvation: “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,” (2 Sam. 22:47). “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my savior, You save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:3). “The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He.” (Dt. 32:4). “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2, 31, 46; 19:14). Worship helps to clear your mind to receive God’s Word. Thus, you should never skip the worship that precedes the message at Church. Through Jesus’ model prayer for us (the Lord’s prayer), He also invites believers to begin by praising God’s holy name (Matt. 6:9). In worship and in prayer, are you giving God praise for all your unearned gifts?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The ark symbolized the new life available through the Spirit</u>. Our God is alive and directly connected to our lives. The contents of the ark also symbolized the power of the Spirit. God told Moses to put the budding rod of Aaron “before the testimony.” (Nu. 17:10). The budding rod represents the new life of the Holy Spirit, which is only made possible through Christ’s death. “In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.” (Jo. 1:4). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’” (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). The flowers represent the Holy Spirit, and the wooden rod represents Christ. The Spirit has “set you free from the law of sin and death.” (Ro. 8:1; Col. 2:13-14). Today, the Spirit has made you alive by dwelling within you (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19). As a rod, He also has great power. Turn to the Spirit when you need strength.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a joyful believer</u>. When you feel sorrow, God also wants you to find joy in Him. “Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes shall say, ‘All my springs of joy are in you.’” (Ps. 87:7). “Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with joyful shouting; then they said among the nations, ‘LORD has done great things for them.”’ (Ps. 126:2). “He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouting.” (Job 8:21). “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation; then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.” (Ps. 51:14). “Sarah said, ‘God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.”’ (Gen. 21:6). This joy should also be visible in your giving: “Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, <em>for God loves a cheerful giver</em>.” (2 Cor. 9:7). “For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.” (2 Cor. 8:12; Ex. 25:2). “Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.” (Heb. 13:15). Is your worship filled with joy?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God killed Uzzah for touching the ark</u>. Because the Jews transported the ark in an unauthorized manner, it became unstable and almost fell. Despite acting with the noble intention of saving the ark, God struck Uzzah dead for touching the ark: “<sup>9 </sup><em>When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen nearly upset it. <sup>10 </sup>The anger of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> burned against Uzza, so He struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark; and he died there before God</em>.” (1 Chr. 13:9-10; 2 Sam. 6:6-7). David later explained to the priests that God was upset with not just Uzzah but all of the leaders of Israel. The leaders had failed to seek God’s will in transporting the ark. “Because you did not carry it at the first, the LORD our God made an outburst on us, for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.” (1 Chr. 15:13). Uzzah’s name meant strength. He relied upon his own strength to protect and save the ark. Yet, relying upon his own strength resulted in his death. “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>“The Ten Commandments” inside the ark exposed the sins of mankind</u>. God told Moses to put inside the ark the “testimony which I shall give you.” (Ex. 25:16). The “testimony” was God’s First Covenant of the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:1-17). The Ten Commandments also represented God the Father. If the ark was built to house this and it is the foundation of God’s throne above it, this reveals that God the Father rules through righteousness: “The Rock of Israel spoke to me, ‘He who rules over men righteously . . .’” (2 Sam. 23:3). With righteousness as the foundation of His rule, He cannot ignore sin or allow it to fester in His presence. He is also a consuming fire when any sin is in His presence (Heb. 12:28-29; Dt. 4:24; 9:3; Ps. 97:3). Thus, sinners cannot be in His holy presence (Ex. 33:20; Jo. 1:18). The Ten Commandments remind us that we all have all sinned and fallen short of God’s righteousness (Ro. 3:9-12, 20). Jesus paid the penalty under the Law to allow us to be in the presence of God the Father (1 John 2:2; Col. 2:13-14). But God still wants you to keep the Law in your heart: “Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You.” (Ps. 119:11). “Your Law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40:8(b); 37:11). Because our hearts are wicked (Jer. 17:9), God has written His Law on our hearts (Jer. 31:33). Moreover, He promises to give you a heart that will allow you to understand His Word (Ez. 36:26). The Spirit convicts you of sin by causing you to remember His Word that He has stored inside of you (Jo. 14:26; 15:26). Uzzah died because his sins could not be in God’s holy presence. Without the atoning blood of Jesus Christ and faith in Him, all would suffer the same fate as Uzzah.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Respect God’s Word with a healthy fear of the consequences that come for breaking it</u>. The consequences for touching the ark should not have been a mystery. God repeatedly warned the Jews that the penalty for touching it was death. This penalty applied to both lay persons and even the designated carriers of the ark within the sons of Kohath. “So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death.” (Nu. 1:51). “So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes near shall be put to death.” (Nu. 3:10). “When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry.” (Nu. 4:14; 18:3, 7, 22). Even if the Jews had forgotten these rules, they would have known what happened the last time the Jews touched and publicly examined the ark. It resulted in the deaths of 50,070 men. “He struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck down of all the people, 50,070 men, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter.” (1 Sam. 6:19). Thus, the Jews should have had a healthy reverence for worshiping God correctly.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be in submission to God’s Word and keep your body holy for God’s use</u>. The Kohath tribe was required to protect “the most holy things.” (Nu. 4:4). This included all of the furnishings of the tent of meeting. Today, believers are the bride of Christ (Rev. 22:2, 17). The temple where the Holy Spirit dwells is in your body (1 Cor. 3:16-17). Through Jesus’ death, your body has also been bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:19-20). If you were once a slave to sin, you should now be a slave to righteousness (Ro. 6:17-18). As a slave to righteousness, you cannot follow the morals of the world (Lev. 18:1; Ezek. 20:18-19). As a slave to righteousness, you also should be sanctified and set apart for Christ’s use: “Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.’” (Lev. 19:2; Ex. 22:31; 1 Pet. 1:16; Ep. 1:4; Matt. 5:48). You make yourself a slave to righteousness by making yourself a living sacrifice for Him (Ro. 12:1). Are you living your life as a living sacrifice for God? Or, are you using His mercy and grace as a license to sin even more? (Ro. 6:15; Gal. 5:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be reverent to all of God’s Word, not just the parts you understand</u>. At the time of Uzzah’s death, the Jews either forgot God’s Word or tried to rationalize why there was a better way to accomplish His will. Either was equally sinful in His eyes. Today, there are many churches which seek to work together for God. Churches that fear and follow the Word in its entirety should not be yoked together with those who compromise God’s Word (1 Cor. 11:19). Do you reverently follow all of God’s Word?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David fears God and recognizes the need for a proper mediator to bring the ark</u>. Out of confusion, David was initially angry. Yet, his anger quickly turned to reverent fear after he realized that he had sinned in transporting the ark. He also needed a proper mediator to bring God’s Word to him: “<sup>11 </sup><em>Then David became angry because of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord’s</span> outburst against Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza to this day. <sup>12 </sup>David was afraid of God that day, saying, ‘How can I bring the ark of God home to me?</em>’” (1 Chr. 13:11-12; 2 Sam. 6:8-9). David was at first angry because he did not understand what he did wrong: “Neither David nor his people had intended any disrespect, and so severe a punishment for what was at most a thoughtless act seemed to him unjust. . . . In his first burst of displeasure he called the place Perez-Uzzah, the word ‘Perez,’ or ‘Breach,’ conveying to the Hebrews the idea of a great calamity (Judges 21:15) or of a sudden attack upon a foe (2 Samuel 5:20).” (Pulpit Commentary on 2 Sam. 6). After realizing his sins, he saw that he needed a mediator.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of the Lord brings knowledge of the need for a mediator</u>. When God previously struck down 50,070 men for touching and publicly examining the ark, the people also trembled in fear for lack of a mediator: “The men of Beth-shemesh said, ‘Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?’” (1 Sam. 6:20). David later wrote on many occasions about his reverent fear of God: “My flesh trembles for fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments. Ayin.” (Ps. 119:120). “Worship the LORD with reverence and rejoice with trembling.” (Ps. 2:11). ‘“For My hand made all these things, thus all these things came into being,’ declares the LORD. ‘But to this one I will look, to him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word.”’ (Ps. 66:2). People today are also warned that they must recognize the need for a mediator to be reconciled with God: “So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;” (Phil. 2:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus your advocate has reconciled you to be in God the Father’s presence</u>. Unlike Uzzah or the Jews who suffered in the presence of God’s holiness at Beth Shemesh, believers have an advocate before God the Father: “My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;” (1 Jo. 2:1). He has reconciled you to the Father through His blood: “For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” (Ro. 5:10; 8:34). And He is the only mediator between you and God the Father: “For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,” (1 Tim. 2:5). Do you give thanks that Jesus has allowed for you to be reconciled with God the Father?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God blessed Obed-edom’s family for his faith in accepting the ark to protect it</u>. Once the Jews turned to God and obeyed Him, God blessed the Jews for doing the right thing: “<sup>13 </sup><em>So David did not take the ark with him to the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. <sup>14 </sup>Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months; and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> blessed the family of Obed-edom with all that he had</em>.” (1 Chr. 13:13-14; 2 Sam. 6:10-11). David placed the ark temporarily with Obed-edom because he was part of the Kohath clan within the tribe of Levi (1 Chr. 26:4). As stated above, God entrusted the Kohath clan with the responsibility for caring for and transporting the ark (Nu. 4:15). Once David followed God’s Word, He poured out His blessings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God blesses those who serve with faith-led obedience</u>. This story should not only be remembered because of God’s judgment upon Uzzah. Just as important to the story was God’s blessing upon Obed-edom for opening his home to ark for three months when most were too scared to be near it (2 Sam 6:11). Some of the blessings were immediate. The book of Chronicles also reveals that God’s blessings included eight sons: “Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh and Peullethai the eighth; God had indeed blessed him.” (1 Chron. 26:4-5). If you live in faith led obedience, God also wants to pour His blessings upon you. “Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.” (Dt. 28:1). Have you walked in obedience so that He can also pour His blessings upon you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also wants to pour out His blessings on you</u>. While it is clear that conduct is not a test for salvation, Jesus also made clear that conduct can be a test for certain kinds of spiritual blessings. For example, He promised various conditional blessings in the beatitudes. People who stay true to their faith in Him in the face of persecution will be “blessed” and receive “rewards” in heaven (Matt. 5:11). As another example, He promised “rewards” for those who store up their treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:20). These are just two examples of conditional blessings that are unrelated to your salvation. There are many similar examples in the New Testament.</p></li>
<li><p><u>21 specific blessings in the Torah for those who are faithful and obedient to God</u>. In the four books of the Law, God also reveals at least 21 specific blessings for those who are faithful and obedient to Him. These blessings are unrelated to Jesus’ blessings of eternal salvation. In Exodus, God revealed at least three conditional blessings that come from faithful obedience. These include: (1) protection from diseases (Ex. 15:26); (2) a prolonged life (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16; 5:32-33; 4:40; 6:1-2; 12:28; 22:6-7; 25:13-16; Lev. 18:5; Eph. 6:2-3); and (3) God’s holy presence (Ex. 40:34-35). In Leviticus, God revealed seven other conditional blessings that He may use to bless a person or a nation for obedience. These include: (1) provision (Lev. 26:3-5); (2) peace (Lev. 26:6); (3) protection (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22); (4) fertility (Lev. 26:9); (5) abundance from giving (Lev. 26:10; Ps. 92:12-14; Mal. 3:10-12); (6) guidance (Lev. 26:11-12; Ps. 32:8); and (7) freedom (Lev. 26:13; Ex. 20:2). In Deuteronomy, He revealed 10 other conditional blessings. These include: (1) exaltation for the nation (Dt. 28:1-2); (2) exaltation for the individual within the nation (Dt. 28:1-3); (3) growth (Dt. 28:4); (4) food (Dt. 28:5); (5) success (Dt. 28:6); (6) the defeat of your enemies (Dt. 28:7); (7) prosperity (Dt. 28:8); (8) holiness (Dt. 28:9); (9) respect (Dt. 28:10); and (10) the fullness of God’s blessings (Dt. 28:11-14). Finally, in the books of the Law from Exodus through Deuteronomy, God reveals the blessing of forgiveness from the blood sacrifices (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). Jesus became the final one-time sacrifice to fulfill the Old Testament sacrificial laws (Heb. 10:12). The only act of obedience required to receive this blessing today is to believe that He died for your sins and that He is both your Lord and Savior (Ro. 10:13; Acts 2:21; Jo. 3:16; 1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
