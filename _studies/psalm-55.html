<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 55 describes the intense pain that David felt after a close friend betrayed him and conspired with his enemies to try to kill him. Having a close friend or loved one betray you can be one of the most difficult types of pain to endure. Through this psalm, God reveals seven lessons for dealing with betrayal. These include: (1) seeking God, (2) lamenting to Him, (3) prayer, (4) seeking His comfort, (5) leaving justice to Him, (6) trusting Him, and (7) faith.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, David felt “restless” and “severely distracted” after his enemies conspired to kill him. He cried out for God to hear his prayers. When you feel betrayed, God also wants for you to seek Him with all your heart. <u>Second</u>, David confided to God that his heart was filled with “anguish” and the “terrors of death” had fallen on him. He wished that he could fly away. When you feel betrayed, God also wants for you to pour out your heart to Him. <u>Third</u>, David asked for God to confuse the enemy to thwart their evil plans. When you feel betrayed and someone seeks to harm you, God also wants you to pray for His protection. <u>Fourth</u>, David lamented that his pain was intense because it was a close confidant and friend who betrayed him. When you feel the pain of betrayal, God wants you to turn to Him for comfort. <u>Fifth</u>, David did not seek to avenge himself. Instead, he left justice to God. When you feel betrayed, God also wants you to forgive your enemies and leave justice to Him. <u>Sixth</u>, David expressed confidence that God would hear his prayers and save him. When you feel betrayed, God also wants you to place your trust in Him. <u>Finally</u>, David encouraged others feeling the pain of betrayal to cast their burdens on God and to let Him sustain them. When you feel betrayed, God wants you to also put your faith and hope in Him. He also wants you to encourage others when they experience the pain of betrayal.</p>
<h2 id="seek-god-when-you-feel-betrayed-seek-out-god-with-all-your-heart.-ps.-551-3."><strong>1. <u>Seek God: When You Feel Betrayed, Seek Out God With All Your Heart</u>. Ps. 55:1-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When others betray you, cry out to God for protection</u>. David turned to God in prayer when his enemies conspired against him and betrayed him: <em>“For the music director; on stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Listen to my prayer, God; and do not hide Yourself from my pleading. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Give Your attention to me and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and severely distracted, <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>because of the voice of the enemy, because of the pressure of the wicked; for they bring down trouble upon me and in anger they hold a grudge against me</em>.” (Ps. 55:1-3). There was no person who could understand the depth of his pain after a close friend sought to destroy him. All he could do was turn to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David frequently cried out for God’s fellowship when he felt alone and distraught</u>. David cried out “<em>listen to my prayer</em>” and<em> </em>“<em>do not hide Yourself</em>.” (Ps. 55:1). Like any person, David sometimes felt alone when he faced his enemies. But he showed his faith by crying out to God for his fellowship when he felt alone: “Why do You stand far away, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?” (Ps. 10:1). “Do not hide Your face from me, do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; do not abandon me nor forsake me, God of my salvation!” (Ps. 27:9). “You have seen it, LORD, do not keep silent; Lord, do not be far from me.” (Ps. 35:22). “Do not be far from me, for trouble is near; for there is no one to help.” (Ps. 22:11). “God, do not be far from me; My God, hurry to my aid!” (Ps. 71:12). We can learn from David’s example that it is not a lack of faith when you cannot feel God’s presence. It is instead a sign of great faith to cry out for God’s presence and fellowship when you feel alone.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers His fellowship to you if you seek Him in faith</u>. God promises His fellowship to anyone who earnestly seeks Him in faith: “And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13). “But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.” (Dt. 4:29). Jesus made this same offer to believers at Laodicea. They were saved. But they were not walking in fellowship with Him: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.” (Rev. 3:20). Are you seeking out Jesus’ fellowship?</p></li>
<li><p><u>David also frequently cried out when his enemies sought to destroy him</u>. In reference to his enemies, David stated: “<em>they bring down trouble upon me and in anger they hold a grudge against me</em>.” (Ps. 55:3). David frequently cried out when his enemies sought to destroy him: “How long am I to feel anxious in my soul, with grief in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?” (Ps. 13:2). “From the wicked who deal violently with me, my deadly enemies who surround me.” (Ps. 17:9). “I will say to God my rock, ‘Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”’ (Ps. 42:9). “A Mikhtam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be gracious to me, God, for a man has trampled upon me; fighting all day long he oppresses me.” (Ps. 56:1). “For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.” (Ps. 143:3). When you are attacked, cry out to God for protection.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God can also deliver you from your enemies</u>. David knew that he could cry out to God for deliverance from his enemies. “I was crying out to the LORD with my voice, and He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah” (Ps. 3:4). “But know that the LORD has set apart the godly person for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.” (Ps. 4:3). “Leave me, all you who practice injustice, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.” (Ps. 6:8). “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears.” (Ps. 18:6). “Blessed be the LORD, because He has heard the sound of my pleading.” (Ps. 28:6). If you are in need of deliverance, cry out to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ model prayer included a petition for deliverance</u>. In His model prayer for believers, Jesus also urged believers to include a daily request for deliverance: ‘“And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’” (Matt. 6:13). This is also His prayer for believers: “I am not asking You to take them out of the world, but to keep them away from the evil one.” (Jo. 17:15). Are you praying for God’s daily protection?</p></li>

<h2 id="lament-to-god-when-you-feel-betrayed-pour-out-your-heart-to-god.-ps.-554-8."><strong>2. <u>Lament to God: When You Feel Betrayed, Pour Out Your Heart to God</u>. Ps. 55:4-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Confess your pain to God</u>. While hiding in the wilderness, David felt great sorrow because of his feelings of loss and betrayal. Yet, instead of getting angry, he gave his pain and his sorrow to God in his psalm: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>My heart is in anguish within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>I said, ‘Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Behold, I would flee far away, I would spend my nights in the wilderness. Selah <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>I would hurry to my place of refuge from the stormy wind and heavy gale</em>.’” (Ps. 55:4-8). When you are feeling hurt, God also wants you to give Him all your burdens.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David poured out his honest feelings to God when evil appeared to succeed</u>. David was not stoic when evil prevailed around him. Instead, he poured out his laments to God: “The ropes of death encompassed me, and the torrents of destruction terrified me.” (Ps. 18:4). “I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and a flood overflows me.” (Ps. 69:2). “The snares of death encompassed me and the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.” (Ps. 116:3). Many people imagine that a true person of faith accepts any trial without emotions. David shows that you don’t need to hide your feelings from God. You can instead be honest with Him when you feel frustrated or attacked. Your true faith is in giving Him your burdens.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God welcomes your honest feelings</u>. The Psalms show you how you can express all of your feelings directly to God the same way a child might cry out to his or her parents. According to the French theologian John Calvin (1509-1535 A.D.), the Psalms show you how to confess your every need to God: “Here the prophets themselves, seeing they are exhibited to us as speaking to God, and laying open all their inmost thoughts and affections, call, or rather draw, each of us to the examinations of himself in particular, in order that none of the many infirmities to which we are subject, and of the many vices with which we abound, may remain concealed.” (John Calvin, <em>Commentary on the Book of Psalms</em>, Trans. By James Anderson. 3 Volumes (Eerdmans, 1963 reprint p. xxxvii)).</p></li>

<h2 id="prayer-when-you-feel-betrayed-pray-for-god-to-protect-you.-ps.-559-11."><strong>3. <u>Prayer: When You Feel Betrayed, Pray For God to Protect You</u>. Ps. 55:9-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David cried out for God to confuse his enemies</u>. In the face of the enemy’s conspiracy against him, David prayed for God to impose confusion on their plans: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Confuse them, Lord, divide their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Day and night they go around her upon her walls, and evil and harm are in her midst. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Destruction is in her midst; oppression and deceit do not depart from her streets</em>.” (Ps. 55:9-11). The enemy had relied upon lies and deceit to fight David (Ps. 55:11). These are the tools of the devil (Jo. 8:44). With faith, God can confuse, confound, or defeat any such attack.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God can impose confusion or spiritual blindness on those who practice evil</u>. To correct a sinner, God can cause the sinner to experience confusion or “spiritual blindness”: “<sup>28 </sup>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will smite you with madness and with blindness and with bewilderment of heart; <sup>29 </sup>and you will grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, . . .” (Dt. 28:27-29a; Ex. 10:21). “We grope along the wall like blind men, we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at midday as in the twilight, . . .” (Is. 59:10(a)). “By day they meet with darkness, and grope at noon as in the night.” (Job 5:14; 12:25; 38:15). “They wandered, blind, in the streets; . . .” (Lam. 4:14(a); Amos 8:9). “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.” (Prov. 4:19). For example, God imposed confusion on the rebellious peoples at the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>David’s prayers to thwart the evil counsel of Ahithophel</u>. Some believe that this psalm refers to the betrayal of David’s confidant Ahithophel. When David learned that his friend Ahithophel was advising Absalom, he prayed that God would confound Ahithophel’s advice with foolishness (2 Sam. 15:34). God later answered David’s prayers: “Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, ‘counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.’ For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring calamity on Absalom.” (2 Sam. 17:14). God’s power includes “causing the omens of boasters to fail, making fools out of diviners, causing wise men to draw back and turning their knowledge into foolishness,” (Is. 44:25). Will you turn to God in prayer for deliverance from your adversaries?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gods-comfort-when-you-feel-betrayed-seek-gods-comfort.-ps.-5512-14."><strong>4. <u>God’s Comfort: When You Feel Betrayed, Seek God’s Comfort</u>. Ps. 55:12-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David cried out in anguish that his close friend had betrayed him</u>. Although David faced many enemies, he felt particular anguish here because this time it was a trusted advisor: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>For it is not an enemy who taunts me, then I could endure it; nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me, then I could hide myself from him. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>But it is you, a man my equal, my companion and my confidant; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>we who had sweet fellowship together, walked in the house of God among the commotion</em>.” (Ps. 55:12-14). Although not mentioned by name, Ahithophel meets this description: “And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people continually increased with Absalom.” (2 Sam. 15:12). When you feel betrayed, you can also seek God’s comfort.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David wrote psalms for the pain of betrayal of his friends and family</u>. David wrote many psalms to lament his sorrow at the betrayal of his closest friends and family members (Ps. 55:12-14): “Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.” (Ps. 41:9). “My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.” (Ps. 38:11). “Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; those who would destroy me are powerful, those who oppose me with lies; what I did not steal, I then have to restore . . . I have become estranged from my brothers and an alien to my mother’s sons.” (Ps. 69:4, 8). “My relatives have failed, and my intimate friends have forgotten me . . . All my associates abhor me, and those I love have turned against me.” (Job 19:14, 19). If you are suffering feelings of betrayal, God again wants you to give your pain to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Absalom’s conspiracy to depose his father and king, David</u>. If David was referring to Ahithophel, David referenced Absalom’s conspiracy to depose him. Absalom was David’s third son (2 Sam. 3:3). Sadly, Absalom murdered David’s eldest son Amnon after Amnon raped Absalom’s sister Tammar (2 Sam. 13:23-38). Absalom then fled and spent three years living in exile in Geshur, the homeland of his maternal grandfather (2 Sam. 3:3; 13:37-38). He then spent another two years living under house arrest (2 Sam. 14:28). The second oldest son Chileab would have been the next heir to the throne (2 Sam. 3:3). Yet, despite having murdered his brother, Absalom’s ambition would not let an older brother or even his father stand in front his desire to be king. He embezzled the country’s funds to hire men and horses to put on regal displays for the people. He then conspired to overthrow his father David and become King of Israel (2 Sam. 15:1-6). Absalom was prideful and coveted power because he was both a prince and one of the most handsome men in Israel (2 Sam. 14:25). Absalom’s conspiracy gained strength only after Ahithophel, one of David’s top counselors, turned against David (2 Sam. 15:11-12). Ahithophel was Bathsheba’s grandfather (2 Sam. 11:3; 23:34). Thus, Ahithophel likely had a deep hatred for David. Once David’s advisors determined that Absalom had gained support throughout Israel for his revolt, David was forced to flee with just 600 men (2 Sam. 15:13-18). After seizing power, Ahithophel gave Absalom wicked advice that he sleep with David’s concubines, who also happened to be Absalom’s mothers-in-law (2 Sam. 16:20-21). Absalom then embraced Ahithophel’s evil advice and slept with David’s ten concubines in the open for all to see (2 Sam. 16:22-23). Ahithophel then offered to hunt David down with 12,000 soldiers and kill him (2 Sam 17:1-4). During this time of evil and betrayal, David turned to God and poured out his heart in prayer (2 Sam. 15:30-37). When you feel betrayed, give God your burdens.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus experienced betrayal, He knows the pain of betrayal and can comfort you</u>. Jesus was a loving friend to Judas. Judas responded by betraying Him (Matt. 26:47-56; Mk. 14:43-50; John 18:3-12). Thus, Jesus knows your pain when you feel betrayed, and He longs to show you His compassion when you are sad: “Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, and therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.” (Is. 30:18a). “I, I Myself, am He who comforts you. . . ” (Is. 51:12). “And He said, ‘I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.”’ (Ex. 33:19). When the world turns against you, Jesus offers you His compassion, comfort, and His love: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. “For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.”” (2 Cor. 1:3-5). “But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus;” (2 Cor. 7:6). If you are in need of comfort, are you turning to Jesus? If others around you are suffering, are you pointing them to Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>David frequently poured out his laments of sorrow</u>. David was not a hero of the faith because he bottled up his sorrow. Instead, as our example, he poured out the laments of his heart to God: “Listen to my words, LORD, consider my sighing.” (Ps. 5:1). “For my life is spent with sorrow and my years with sighing; my strength has failed because of my guilt, and my body has wasted away.” (Ps. 31:10). “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within me.” (Ps. 22:14). “For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually before me.” (Ps. 38:17). “Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” (Ps. 42:9<strong><sup>b</sup></strong>). God invites you to seek out His comfort as often as you need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gods-justice-when-you-feel-betrayed-leave-vengeance-to-god.-ps.-5515."><strong>5. <u>God’s Justice: When You Feel Betrayed, Leave Vengeance to God</u>. Ps. 55:15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David prayed for his attackers to face God’s justice</u>. David prayed for his attackers to meet the same fate that they sought to impose upon him: “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>May death come deceitfully upon them; may they go down alive to Sheol, for evil is in their dwelling, in their midst</em>.” (Ps. 55:15). David called upon God to treat the rebellion against God’s anointed king the same way He treated Korah’s rebellion against God’s anointed lawgiver Moses (Nu. 16:30-31). The Psalms contain similar pleas: “May those be ashamed and humiliated together who seek my life to destroy it; may those be turned back and dishonored who delight in my hurt.” (Ps. 40:14). “But those who seek my life to destroy it, will go into the depths of the earth.” (Ps. 63:9). What is important about all these petitions is that David left vengeance to God. Believers should do the same and forgive their enemies.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Leave justice to God instead of seeking your own vengeance</u>. Also as our example, David prayed for God to vindicate him when he was attacked (Ps. 55:15). David did not attempt to seek vengeance or take matters into his own hands: “A Psalm of David. Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. . . Judge me, LORD my God, according to Your righteousness, and do not let them rejoice over me.” (Ps. 35:1, 25). “Vindicate me, God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; save me from the deceitful and unjust person!” (Ps. 43:1). For example, David told Saul that God would judge their dispute: “May the LORD judge between you and me, and may the LORD take vengeance on you for me; but my hand shall not be against you. . . May the LORD therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and save me from your hand.” (1 Sam. 24:12, 15). Instead of trying to right the wrongs against you, God also wants you to forgive and leave justice to Him. Even if His timing is not your timing, He will be just and fair to you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>To receive God’s mercy and grace, forgive those who harm you</u>. At another point in David’s life, he would be on the receiving end of God’s justice for his own betrayal and murder. Uriah was one of David’s “mighty men” and a close confidant (2 Sam. 23:39). David first betrayed him by committing adultery with his wife Beersheba (2 Sam. 11:2-5). He then tried to deceive Uriah into having him return home from war and sleep with Beersheba to make him think that he was the father of David’s child in her womb (2 Sam. 11:6-13). When his efforts at deceit failed, David betrayed Uriah again by sending him to his death in battle to cover up his adultery (2 Sam. 11:14-25). Although David, his family, and Israel had ongoing consequences for his sins, God spared David from death because he repented (2 Sam. 12:1-14). “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6; Dt. 4:31; Ps. 145:8; Eph. 2:4). God also forgave David because he forgave his many enemies. To receive God’s forgiveness and His mercy and grace, you must also forgive your attackers: “But if you do not forgive other people, then your Father will not forgive your offenses.” (Matt. 6:15). If you are feeling the pain of betrayal from a loved one or friend, forgive them.</p></li>

<h2 id="trust-when-you-feel-betrayed-place-your-trust-in-god.-ps.-5516-21."><strong>6. <u>Trust: When You Feel Betrayed, Place Your Trust in God</u>. Ps. 55:16-21.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David placed his trust in God and was confident in God’s deliverance</u>. Even though he felt the pain of betrayal and threats to his life, David trusted in God to redeem his soul: “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>As for me, I shall call upon God, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will save me. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and moan, and He will hear my voice. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle which is against me, for they are many who are aggressive toward me. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>God will hear and humiliate them— even the one who sits enthroned from ancient times— Selah With whom there is no change, and who do not fear God. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has violated his covenant. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>His speech was smoother than butter, but his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords</em>.” (Ps. 55:16-21). Those who opposed David had violated God’s covenant (Ps. 55:20). God would hold them accountable.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Even if David died, he trusted God to redeem his soul</u>. David expressed confidence that God would “<em>redeem</em>” his “<em>soul in peace.</em>” (Ps. 55:18). “Into Your hand I entrust my spirit; <em>You have redeemed me</em>, LORD, God of truth.” (Ps. 31:5). “My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You; and <em>my soul, which You have redeemed</em>.” (Ps. 71:23). With faith in Jesus Christ, you can also trust that your soul is redeemed (Col. 1:13-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God gave David courage because of his faith</u>. Because David was a man of great faith, God blessed David with the courage to face evil: “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread? . . . If an army encamps against me, My heart will not fear; if war arises against me, in spite of this I am confident.” (Ps. 27:1, 3; 1 Sam. 17:45). “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.” (Ps. 23:4). “I have set the LORD continually before me; because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.” (Ps. 16:8; Acts 2:25). “The LORD is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me? . . . All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I will certainly fend them off.” (Ps. 118:6, 10). He “by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,” (Heb. 11:33). With faith in God, you also never need to fear evil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God reduced David’s army to help him to put his trust in God</u>. In order to help David place his full trust in God, God only allowed David to flee from Absalom with 600 men (2 Sam. 15:18). This was the exact number of men that David had when he lived in the wilderness fleeing from Saul’s army (1 Sam. 23:13; 30:9). With God on their side, David’s forces defeated a far larger army serving under Absalom’s command. Despite only three companies in David’s army, God caused Absalom’s larger forces to panic, break ranks, and flee in every direction into the woods (2 Sam. 18:6-8). Absalom then fled on a donkey and was caught by his head in the branches (2 Sam. 18:9-10). David’s general Joab then executed him (2 Sam. 18:11-15). Because Absalom was fighting against God’s anointed king, there was no question about the outcome: “The LORD shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you one way and will flee before you seven ways.” (Dt. 28:7; Lev. 26:7). “How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had given them up?” (Dt. 32:30). When you feel under attack while doing God’s work, this should also give you hope. God can never be defeated.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Put your trust in God, even when His plans are unknown</u>. Even when it seems that evil is prevailing, God wants you to trust that He is in control: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” (1 Cor. 16:13). “Be strong and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in the LORD.” (Ps. 31:24). “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6). Even if an evil person tries to kill you, your soul remains protected with Jesus: “I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.” (Lk. 12:4). When you feel attacked or betrayed, put your complete trust in God.</p></li>

<li><p><u>David encouraged others to have faith in God and place their hopes in Him</u>. David concluded by encouraging others to place their faith and hope in God for deliverance: “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Cast your burden upon the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>But You, God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You</em>.” (Ps. 55:22-23). “David had hope and confidence because he was persuaded that his fate did not rest in the hands of treacherous men. God was still Lord over all, and God had the final word on whether the righteous would be moved or not.” (David Guzik on Ps. 55).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Put your hope in God when you are under attack</u>. David urged believers to “<em>Cast your burden upon the </em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Ps. 55:22). The Apostle Peter later repeated David’s words when he encouraged believers to “cast all your anxiety on Him [Jesus], because He cares about you.” (1 Pet. 5:7). When others turn on you, give your burdens to God: “Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words.” (Ps. 119:161). “Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, yet I do not turn aside from Your testimonies.” (Ps. 119:157). “The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.” (2 Tim. 4:18). “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Do you trust in God alone to deliver you when you are attacked?</p></li>

<li><p><u>God gave David comfort through his faithful friends</u>. David found God’s provision through his friends. This included many gentile converts (e.g., 2 Sam. 15:19-23). Here, David returned the favor by offering advice for fellow believers and friends to follow. In your time of need, Jesus also wants you to turn to Him instead of worrying (Matt. 6:25-34). Jesus frequently uses other believers to be His hands and feet to those who are in need. This can include both physical and emotional support “Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.” (Gal. 6:2). If you have unmet needs or worry, give your burdens to Jesus. If you are feeling fine, support those who are in need.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Encourage one another in times of distress</u>. God also wants you to be a source of encouragement to others. “But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called ‘Today,’ so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (Heb. 3:13). “But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.” (Heb. 13:22). Will you encourage others the way God is there for you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>David also credited God with his victory</u>. As an example to others, David also gave all the credit back to God when his enemies failed: “I will sing a new song to You, O God; upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You, <em>who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.”</em> (Ps. 144:9-10; 18:48, 50; 2 Sam. 22:51). When God delivers you from a struggle, will you also give Him the full credit?</p></li>
