<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is David’s final psalm. It is the only psalm with the subscription line “<em>A Psalm of Praise, of David.</em>” (Ps. 145:1). It is also a masterpiece of acrostic Hebrew poetry. Each of the 22 verses begins with the next consecutive letter in the Hebrew alphabet, from “<em>Aleph</em>” (<span dir="rtl">א</span>) to “<em>Tav</em>” (<span dir="rtl">ת</span>ּ).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Likely written at the end of his life, it reflects David’s lessons for his people to worship God. It likely appears at the end of the Psalter to reflect the promised praise for the future Messiah, which the New Testament reveals to be Jesus. He is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). He is also the “Alpha” and the “Omega” (Rev. 1:8). Through David’s final psalm, the Bible reveals seven lessons for properly worshiping Jesus. These include: (1) submission, (2) consistency, (3) gratitude, (4) public praise, (5) trust, (6) reverence, and (7) love.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, although David was King of Israel, he promised to exalt God as his true King of Kings. Proper worship begins by submitting to and praising Jesus as your true King and Savior. <u>Second</u>, David promised to worship God daily, for all eternity, and that future generations would also worship Him. Proper worship should also include consistency and family worship. <u>Third</u>, David joyfully praised God for His goodness, compassion, and His mercy. Proper worship should also include joyful gratitude for Jesus’ works, His goodness, His compassion, and His mercy. <u>Fourth</u>, David promised that all God’s works would praise Him, and that they would become a public testimony to the “sons of mankind.” Proper worship should be both public and be a witness to others of Jesus’ light within you. <u>Fifth</u>, David praised God’s everlasting kingdom, and His faithfulness to provide in His timing. Proper worship should also trust in Jesus’ faithfulness and His provision in His timing. <u>Sixth</u>, David declared God’s righteousness and His promise to fulfill the desires of those who fear Him. Proper worship is also reverent to Jesus. <u>Finally</u>, David promises that God watches over those who love Him, and he promised that all would one day praise Him for all eternity. Proper worship should also be based upon a sincere love for Jesus. Out of love, His people will sing praises to Him for all eternity.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David submitted to and exalted God as his King</u>. Even though David was Israel’s King, he submitted to, exalted, and worshiped God as his one true King. “<em>A Psalm of Praise, of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I will exalt You, my God, the King,</em>” (Ps. 145:1a). The NASB and NIV translate the Hebrew words “<span dir="rtl">אֲרוֹמִמְך</span>ָ֣” (’ă·rō·w·mim·ḵā) as “<em>I will exalt You</em>.” In the KJB and the NKJV, this is translated as “<em>I will extol You</em>.” “David honored and promoted the name of God in the most personal of ways: · He did it with a direct address (<strong>You</strong>). · He did it with a personal reference (<strong>my God</strong>). · He did it with a surrendered heart (<strong>O King</strong>). · He did it unendingly (<strong>forever and ever…every day</strong>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 145:1).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s name should be exalted</u>. David promised to “exalt” God (Ps. 145:1a). Throughout the Psalter, the psalmists exalted God. “A Psalm of David. <em>I will exalt You</em>, LORD, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:1). “They are to praise the name of the LORD, for <em>His name alone is exalted</em>; His majesty is above earth and heaven.” (Ps. 148:13). This means that God is above everything that exists.</p></li>

<p>Submit and exalt Jesus with the praise that He is owed<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Submit to God as your Lord</u>. David also called God his King (Ps. 145:1a). Throughout the Psalter, the psalmists also urged God’s people to praise Him as His servants. “Praise the LORD! Praise Him, <em>you servants of the LORD</em>, praise the name of the LORD.” (Ps. 113:1). “A Song of Ascents. Behold, bless the LORD, all <em>you servants of the LORD</em>, who serve by night in the house of the LORD!” (Ps. 134:1). “Praise the LORD! Praise the name of the LORD; praise Him, <em>you servants of the LORD</em>,” (Ps. 135:1). This means that proper worship should include loving submission to God as the ruler over your life.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submit to Jesus as your Savior and King of Kings</u>. David’s psalm of praise foreshadowed Jesus Christ. God the Father would install the Messiah as King on Mount Zion. “But as for Me, I have installed My King Upon Zion, My holy mountain.” (Ps. 2:6). All nations will one day submit to Jesus as the King of Kings and Lord of Lord. “For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:9-11). “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written: ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.’” (Rev. 19:16). This means that your worship should lift up, glorify, and submit to Jesus as your King.</p></li>

<h2 id="consistency-proper-worship-includes-continuous-praise-for-jesus-and-raising-your-children-to-also-love-him.-ps.-1451b-4."><strong>2. <u>Consistency: Proper Worship Includes Continuous Praise for Jesus and Raising Your Children to Also Love Him</u>. Ps. 145:1b-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s people will continuously worship Him for all eternity</u>. For his God and his King, David promised daily and eternal praises from himself and from generation to generation. “<em>and I will bless Your name forever and ever. <strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Great is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and highly to be praised; and His greatness is unsearchable. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>One generation will praise Your works to another, and will declare Your mighty acts</em>.” (Ps. 145:1b-4). “As we receive blessings from God every day…, it is proper that we should render to him daily thanks; as God is the same always – ‘yesterday, today, and forever’ - it is proper that he should receive from day to day the tribute of praise;… Successive generations of people shall take up the language of praise, and it shall thus be transmitted to the end of time.” (Albert Barnes, Ps. 145:2, 4).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your worship life should also be continuous</u>. As our example, David and other psalmists continually praised God. “A Psalm of David … I will bless the LORD <em>at all times</em>; His praise shall <em>continually</em> be in my mouth.” (Ps. 34:1). “And my tongue shall proclaim Your righteousness and Your praise <em>all day long</em>.” (Ps. 35:28). “My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your glory <em>all day long</em>…My tongue also will tell of Your righteousness <em>all day long</em>; ...” (Ps. 71:8, 24a). “I will give thanks to You, Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name <em>forever</em>.” (Ps. 86:12). “I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.” (Ps. 146:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship Jesus on a continuous basis</u>. Believers in Jesus are also encouraged to worship Him on a continuous basis. “Through Him then, let’s <em>continually</em> offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name.” (Heb. 13:15). Such praise should happened during both good and bad times:  “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;”  (Eph. 5:20).  “in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.”  (1 Thess. 5:18). Even during difficult times, this means that you should make a daily habit of praising Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ unfathomable love</u>. David praised God’s greatness as being beyond our understanding. “<em>His greatness is unsearchable.</em>” (Ps. 145:3). Paul explained that Jesus’ love for mankind is beyond our full understanding. “and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.” (Eph. 3:19). “Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!” (Ro. 11:33). Until you get to heaven, you will never fully appreciate the full cost that Jesus paid for you.</p></li>

<p>Jesus’ love for you is greater than you can fully understand<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Teach your children to also love and worship Jesus</u>. David proclaimed that generation after generation would praise God (Ps. 145:4). The psalmist Asaph also declared that God’s wonders would be declared from generation to generation. “We will not conceal them from their children, but we will tell the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and His power and His wondrous works that He has done.” (Ps. 78:4). This means that every believer has a duty to teach their children and grandchildren to love God. “And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. And you shall repeat them diligently to your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.” (Dt. 6:5-7). “. . . but make them known to your sons and your grandsons.”  (Dt. 4:9). “ . . . that they may teach their children.”  (Dt. 4:10).  “You shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up.”  (Dt. 11:19; Prov. 22:6; Ps. 78:4-6; Eph. 6:4). </p></li>

<h2 id="gratitude-proper-worship-should-include-joyful-gratitude-for-jesus-works-his-goodness-his-compassion-and-his-mercy-and-grace.-ps.-1455-9."><strong>3. <u>Gratitude: Proper Worship Should Include Joyful Gratitude for Jesus’ Works, His Goodness, His Compassion, and His Mercy and Grace</u>. Ps. 145:5-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David meditated on and gave thanks for God’s goodness, compassion, and His mercy</u>. As part of his worship, David contemplated on and gave thanks for God’s majesty, His works, His goodness, His grace, His compassion, and His mercy. “<em><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>On the glorious splendor of Your majesty and on Your wonderful works, I will meditate. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>People will speak of the power of Your awesome acts, and I will tell of Your greatness. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They will burst forth in speaking of Your abundant goodness, and will shout joyfully of Your righteousness. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is gracious and compassionate; slow to anger and great in mercy. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is good to all, and His mercies are over all His works</em>.” (Ps. 145:5-9). “It was the duty of every faithful Israelite to set forth God’s majesty, and to ‘declare his works with rejoicing’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-2.htm"><u>Psalm 117:2</u></a>). David proclaims himself ready to perform this duty. Then, he thinks, others will join in.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 145:5).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His wondrous works</u>. As our example, David and the other psalmists regularly praised God for His wondrous works. “A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; <em>I will tell of all Your wonders</em>.” (Ps. 9:1). “That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving and <em>declare all Your wonders</em>.”  (Ps. 26:7). “<em>Many, LORD my God, are the wonders which You have done</em>, and Your thoughts toward us; there is no one to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, they would be too numerous to count.” (Ps. 40:5). “<em>LORD, how many are Your works</em>! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your possessions.” (Ps. 104:24). “Great are the works of the LORD; they are studied by all who delight in them. Splendid and majestic is His work, and His righteousness endures forever. <em>He has caused His wonders to be remembered;</em> the LORD is gracious and compassionate.” (Ps. 111:2-4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His compassion</u>.  David and other psalmists regularly thanked God for His loving compassion (Ps. 145:8). “<em>The LORD is compassionate</em> and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness.” (Ps. 103:8). “Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, <em>our God is compassionate</em>.” (Ps. 116:5).  “For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.”  (Ps. 86:5). Moses also declared that God is compassionate and slow to anger. “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, <em>compassionate</em> and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). “For the LORD <em>your God is a compassionate God</em>; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.”  (Dt. 4:31). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His mercy</u>.  David also thanked God for His mercy (Ps. 145:8-9). Jesus’ mercy through His atonement also deserves your praise. “<em>The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in mercy, forgiving wrongdoing and violation of His Law</em>; ....” (Nu. 14:18a). “<em>The LORD’s acts of mercy indeed do not end</em>, for His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.” (Lam. 3:22-23). “<em>You are a God of forgiveness</em>, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and <em>abounding in mercy</em>; and You did not abandon them.”  (Neh. 9:17).  “Who is a God like You, who pardons wrongdoing and passes over a rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, because <em>He delights in mercy</em>.” (Micah 7:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus that He will never leave nor forsake you because of your sins</u>.  Even though the Jews had repeatedly rebelled against God, Moses encouraged them that God would never forsake His people:  “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you.  He will not fail you or forsake you.”  (Dt. 31:6; 4:31; Heb. 13:5).  Jesus’ mercy is so great that He will one day wipe His memory of your sins. ‘“I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.”’  (Is. 43:25).  You can also give thanks that His faithfulness is not conditioned upon our faithfulness:  “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.”  (2 Tim. 2:13). </p></li>

<h2 id="public-praise-proper-worship-should-be-both-public-and-a-witness-to-jesus-light-within-you.-ps.-14510-12."><strong>4. <u>Public Praise: Proper Worship Should be Both Public and a Witness to Jesus’ Light Within You</u>. Ps. 145:10-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David promised that all God’s creation would worship Him as a testimony to mankind</u>. As part of his worship, David prophetically promised that all creation would praise God as a testimony to the “sons of mankind.” “<em><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>All Your works will give thanks to You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Your godly ones will bless You. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They will speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your might, <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>to make known to the sons of mankind Your mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of Your kingdom</em>.” (Ps. 145:10-12). “No subject is more profitable for humility, obedience, hope, and joy than that of the reigning power of the Lord our God. His works praise him, but they cannot crown him: this remains for holy hands and hearts.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 145:11).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> “All God’s works show forth his praises. He satisfies the desire of every living thing, except the unreasonable children of men, who are satisfied with nothing.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 145:10-12).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>All creation bears witness to Jesus’ wondrous works</u>. David declared that “<em>All Your works will give thanks to You,</em>” (Ps. 145:10). The psalmists prophetically promised that all creation will praise God. “All the earth will worship You, and will sing praises to You; they will sing praises to Your name. Selah” (Ps. 66:4). “Everything that has breath shall praise the LORD. Praise the LORD!” (Ps. 150:6). These prophecies all foreshadowed Jesus. One day, all creation will praise and worship Him. “And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.”’ (Rev. 5:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Many people sadly refuse to acknowledge Jesus as their Lord and Savior</u>. Although all creation bears witness to Jesus, many people are spiritually blind to this truth. “An ox knows its owner, and a donkey its master’s manger, but Israel does not know, My people do not understand.” (Is. 1:3). “Even the stork in the sky knows her seasons; and the turtledove and the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration; but My people do not know the ordinance of the LORD.”  (Jer. 8:7).  Thus, your testimony is needed.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Publicly praise Jesus and share the hope that lies within you</u>. Even in Old Testament times, God’s people were meant to publicly praise God and share His light with the lost. “Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; <em>declare His deeds among the peoples</em>.” (Ps. 9:110). “Sing to the LORD, bless His name; <em>proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day</em>. Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.” (Ps. 96:2-3). “And on that day you will say, ‘Give thanks to the LORD, call on His name. <em>Make known His deeds among the peoples</em>; make them remember that His name is exalted. Praise the LORD in song, for He has done glorious things; <em>let this be known throughout the earth</em>.”’ (Is. 12:4-5) “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; <em>I will also make You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth</em>.”’ (Is. 49:6). “<em>How delightful on the mountains are the feet of one who brings good news</em>, who announces peace and brings good news of happiness, who announces salvation, and says to Zion, ‘Your God reigns!”’ (Is. 52:7). Jesus is the “good news” that every believer is called upon to share (Matt. 28:18-20).</p></li>

<h2 id="trust-proper-worship-trusts-in-jesus-faithfulness-and-his-provision-in-his-timing.-ps.-14513-16."><strong>5. <u>Trust: Proper Worship Trusts in Jesus’ Faithfulness and His Provision in His Timing</u>. Ps. 145:13-16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed God’s eternal kingdom, and His faithfulness to provide in His timing</u>. David gave thanks for God’s everlasting kingdom and His faithfulness to keep all of His promises and to provide for His people according to His timing. “<em><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures throughout all generations. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is faithful in His words, and holy in all His works. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> supports all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in due time. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing</em>.” (Ps. 145:13-16). “Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,.... So it is opposed to all other kingdoms and monarchies, which have had or will have an end; as the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman; with all other states which will be on the spot when this kingdom is set up in its glory, and will continue forever, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm"><u>Daniel 2:44</u></a>; and the King of it is opposed to all other kings, who die, and their kingdoms are no more to them; but he never dies, he lives forevermore;” (John Gill on Ps. 145:13).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in Jesus’ eternal faithfulness</u>.  David celebrated God’s “<em>everlasting kingdom,</em>” (Ps. 145:13). Daniel promised the arrival of the Messiah whose reign will last forever (Dan. 7:14). Jesus came to fulfill this promise. “Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and <em>He will reign forever and ever</em>.”’ (Rev. 11:15). “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” (Heb. 13:8). Because His Kingdom is eternal, you can trust in His faithfulness to keep His promises for all eternity. “God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “and I will remember My covenant, . . .” (Gen. 9:15; Neh. 1:5). Jesus is faithful, even when we are not: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you given thanks that you can trust in His faithfulness to keep His promises?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Psalm 145:13’s message regarding God’s faithfulness</u>. In the NASB, NIV, Berean, and other translations, the second half of verse 13 includes a verse beginning with the Hebrew letter “n” “<em>nun</em>” (<span dir="rtl">נ</span>). The second half of this verse stresses the connection between God’s eternal reign and His faithfulness: “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is faithful in His words, and holy in all His works</em>.” But this second half of verse 13 does not appear in the KJB and the NKJV translations. The more recent Masoretic text, which the KJB and the NKJV rely upon, does not have this part of verse 13. But the oldest known Dead Sea scrolls contain this part of verse 13.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This second half of verse 13 also appears in the Greek Septuagint text (2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> Century B.C.).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Moreover, without the second half of verse 13, one letter in the Hebrew acrostic pattern would be missing. Even without the second half of verse 13, other verses establish that this verse celebrates God’s eternal faithfulness. In connection with God’s eternal reign (Ps. 145:13), David bolstered his faith by meditating on God’s faithfulness in fulfilling His works (Ps. 145:5). Other psalmists also found comfort by meditating on God’s faithfulness of His works. “I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; I will certainly remember Your wonders of old. I will meditate on all Your work, and on Your deeds with thanksgiving.” (Ps. 77:11-12; 104:24; 105:5; 111:2, 4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust Jesus to lift you up when you are weary or burdened</u>. David also celebrated that God lifts up those who have fallen before Him. “<em><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> supports all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down.</em>” (Ps. 145:14). God also promises to uphold and strengthen those who place their trust in Him. ‘“Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will also help you, I will also uphold you with My righteous right hand.”’ (Is. 41:10). Jesus came to fulfill these promises. He will lift you up when you are weary or burdened and place your trust in Him. “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is comfortable, and My burden is light.’ (Matt. 11:28-30).</p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus for the comfort and love He offers you<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust Jesus to provide for you</u>. David also gave thanks that God provides for His people in His timing. “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in due time. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing</em>.” (Ps. 145:15-16). Other psalmists gave similar praises. “They all wait for You to give them their food in due season.” (Ps. 104:27). “Who gives food to all flesh, for His faithfulness (Hesed) is everlasting.” (Ps. 136:25). “It is He who gives an animal its food, and feeds young ravens that cry.” (Ps. 147:9). Jesus will also provide for His people. “Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather crops into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they?” (Matt. 6:26; Lk. 12:24). This, your worship should both thank Jesus and trust in His provision.</p></li>

<li><p><u>David declared God’s righteousness and His comforting presence for all who fear Him</u>. As part of his worship, David proclaimed God’s righteousness in all His actions and His promise to be near to and comfort those who fear Him. “<em><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is righteous in all His ways, and kind in all His works. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry for help and save them</em>.” (Ps. 145:17-19). “He is at once perfectly just, and absolutely tender and compassionate. ‘<strong>All</strong> his works’ experience both his justice and his tenderness” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 145:17) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is righteous in all His ways and therefore worthy of respect</u>. David proclaimed God’s righteousness in all that He does (Ps. 145:17). God is holy and perfect in all that He does. “The Rock! <em>His work is perfect</em>, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and just is He.” (Dt. 32:4). “<em>As for God, His way is blameless</em>; the word of the LORD is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (Ps. 18:30; 2 Sam. 22:31). Jesus’ reign is also just and perfect. “And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, ‘Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; <em>righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations</em>!”’ (Rev. 15:3). Thus, Jesus is worthy of reverent worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing God means hating evil, not fearing His wrath</u>. Many assume that to fear God means to be weary of being struck down. But this is inaccurate. Solomon explained that fearing God means hating evil: “<em>The fear of the LORD is to hate evil</em>; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). “<em>Hate evil</em>, you who love the LORD, who watches over the souls of His godly ones; He saves them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 97:10). God will bless those who call on Him while keeping their hearts pure. “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him;</em>” (Ps. 145:18-19). “For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him?” (Dt. 4:7). Thus, you can also fear God by repenting of your sins and purifying your heart of evil desires. “Come close to God and He will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (Jam. 4:8).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by showing Him reverent worship</u>. Because God will “<em>fulfill the desire of those who fear Him;</em>” (Ps. 145:19a), He is worthy of reverent worship. “<em>You who fear the LORD</em>, <em>praise Him</em>; all you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, and stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel.” (Ps. 22:23). “He will bless those who fear the LORD, the small together with the great.” (Ps. 115:13). “House of Levi, bless the LORD; You who revere the LORD, bless the LORD.” (Ps. 135:20). Your reverent fear should also inspire praise for Jesus. “And a voice came from the throne, saying, ‘<em>Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants, you who fear Him</em>, the small and the great.”’ (Rev. 19:5). Thus, your approach to worship should not be flippant or casual.</p></li>

<li><p><u>David promised God’s blessing for those who love Him, and vowed to praise Him</u>. David concluded with a promise that God would watch over those who love Him, and David’s promise to praise God with others for all eternity. “<em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over all who love Him, but He will destroy all the wicked. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>My mouth will speak the praise of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever</em>.” (Ps. 145:20-21). “All men of every race, condition, or generation should unite to glorify God. No man needs think that he will be rejected when he comes with his personal note of praise; all are permitted, invited, and exhorted to magnify the Lord.” (Charles Spurgeon, Ps. 145:21).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A desire to worship should stem from a love of Jesus</u>. David’s final words stressed the importance of loving God. “<em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over all who love Him,</em>” (Ps. 145:20). The <em>Shema</em>, the Jewish call to worship, also required that the Jews follow God’s law as an act of love: “You shall love the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.” (Dt. 6:5). In Hebrew, the reference to a person’s “heart” also includes their “mind.” (e.g., Zech. 8:17; Dt. 9:4; 2 Sam. 13:33; 2 Kgs. 23:25; Esth. 4:13; Is. 10:7).  Centuries later, a Pharisee sought to test Jesus.  He asked Jesus to name the greatest of the Ten Commandments (Matt. 22:34).  Jesus responded by quoting the second verse of the <em>Shema. </em> Yet, because the word “heart” in Greek does not include the word “mind,” He added the word “mind” when He stated the greatest commandment: “You shall love the Lord God with all your heart, and all your soul and with all your mind.” (Matt. 22:35-38; Mk. 12:29-30; Lk. 10:27; Ex. 20:1-8).  If you love God, you will want to keep His commandments out of loving devotion: “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.” (1 Jo. 5:3). If you love God, you will also want to worship Him out of love and not obligation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your love for Jesus be evident through unending praise</u>. David’s final words expressed his commitment to continually worship God. “<em>My mouth will speak the praise of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever</em>.” (Ps. 145:21). In heaven, believers will be so overcome with loving devotion for all that Jesus has done that they will praise Him forever. “And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.”’ (Rev. 5:13). “The praise of God seen in Rev. 4-5 enacts what David declares in Ps 145, and the satisfaction of all living things by the very presence of God in Rev 21-22 consummates the acrostic and chiastic poetry of the ‘praise of David.’” (James Hamilton on Ps. 145).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> “The message of this praise psalm, and the others to follow in the grand doxology, have a very clear application: Praise the LORD, now and always, faithfully and enthusiastically.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 145).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
