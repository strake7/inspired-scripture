<p><u>Introduction</u>: David most likely wrote this psalm as King of Israel before leading his army into battle against more numerous foreign armies (Ps. 144:7, 11; 2 Sam. 8). The post-exile Jews, to whom the final part of the Psalter was primarily directed, mostly faced a spiritual threat instead of physical battles. Because this psalm has 18 references to David’s psalm of deliverance, Psalm 18, this also likely points to the Messiah as the future deliverer. “The density of references to Ps 18 and the positioning of Ps 144 near the end of the Psalter, the second-to-last of the final set of Davidic psalms, see to suggest here David prays that God would once again do the Ps. 18-style salvation for the future David,”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Today, most believers need Jesus for a spiritual instead of a physical deliverance. “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12). Here, Jesus reveals seven lessons for finding success through Him in spiritual warfare. These include: (1) His spiritual gifts, (2) His spiritual armor, (3) His love, (4) His power, (5) your worship, (6) His deliverance, and (7) your trust.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, before the battle began, David credited God with giving him the abilities to succeed. With faith, God has also prepared you in advance with the spiritual gifts needed to succeed in spiritual warfare. <u>Second</u>, David also had the faith to know that God would be his shield and protect him in battle. With faith, God also gives you the spiritual armor needed to succeed in spiritual warfare. <u>Third</u>, David marveled at how God would care for His people when mankind is so insignificant next to Him. Because God loves you, you can also have the faith to know that He will never leave you in spiritual warfare. <u>Fourth</u>, David called for God’s power to rain down upon His pagan enemies who sought to prevent His promises from happening. With faith, God’s power will also vanquish your enemy in any type of spiritual warfare. <u>Fifth</u>, before the battle began, David also worshipped God. Through worship, you also have a powerful weapon in spiritual warfare that will weaken and drive your enemy away. <u>Sixth</u>, David turned to God in prayer and pleaded for God’s deliverance on the battlefield. God also wants to turn to Him for your deliverance. He will then allow you to succeed in spiritual warfare. <u>Finally</u>, David concluded by promising blessings for those who trust God. To succeed in spiritual warfare, God also promises you blessings if you place your trust in Him and not the things of the flesh. </p>

Ps. 144:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God prepared you with the gifts to succeed in spiritual warfare</u>. Before the battle began, David praised God for preparing him with the gifts that he would need to succeed. “<em>A Psalm of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle</em>;” (Ps. 144:1). “All wisdom and skill are from the Lord, and for them he deserves to be gratefully extolled. This teaching extends to the smallest members of our frame: the Lord teaches fingers as well as hands;” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 144:1).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<p>God gives you every gift needed to succeed in spiritual warfare<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>To build your faith and avoid pride, give God all the credit for your spiritual gifts</u>. David was a celebrated warrior with many victories in battle (e.g., 1 Sam. 17:48-50; 18:26-27). But he was careful to avoid taking the credit for God’s victories. As our example, David gave God the credit for training his hands and fingers in conflict (Ps. 144:1). In his song of deliverance, David made a similar claim. “He trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.” (Ps. 18:34; 2 Sam. 22:35). God formed you in the womb with every physical and spiritual gift that you will ever need to serve Him. “This is what the LORD says, He who made you and formed you from the womb, who will help you: ‘Do not fear, Jacob My servant, and Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.”’ (Is. 44:2). “Listen to me, you islands, and pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb; from the body of My mother He named Me. He has made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of His hand He has concealed me; and He has also made me a sharpened arrow, He has hidden me in His quiver.” (Is. 49:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To succeed in spiritual warfare, use the gifts that God has given you</u>. Just as God gave David gifts and abilities to succeed in battle, He has given each person different gifts to succeed for Him in spiritual warfare. But these gifts are all different. As led by the Holy Spirit, these gifts must be used together for His common good. “Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit …But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.” (1 Cor. 12:4, 7-11). “However, since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to use them properly: if prophecy, in proportion to one’s faith; if service, in the act of serving; or the one who teaches, in the act of teaching; or the one who exhorts, in the work of exhortation; the one who gives, with generosity; the one who is in leadership, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.” (Ro. 12:6-8). As led by the Holy Spirit, are you using the gifts that He has given you?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God offers you the spiritual armor that you need to succeed in spiritual warfare</u>. Before David began the battle against foreign, pagan armies (2 Sam. 8), he declared in faith that God would be faithful in battle to be his shield and defeat his enemies. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>my faithfulness and my fortress, my stronghold and my savior, my shield and He in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me</em>.” (Ps. 144:2). God “protected him from all evil and danger; whose favor encompassed him as a shield; whose salvation was a shield to him; and more particularly the person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of his Son, called the shield of faith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-16.htm"><u>Ephesians 6:16</u></a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Bible, Ps. 144:2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s <em>Hesed</em> went before David</u>. David declared that God’s <em>Hesed</em> (<span dir="rtl">חַסְדִּ֥י</span>) would protect him (Ps. 1442:2). In the NASB, this is translated as God’s “<em>faithfulness</em>.” In the KJB, it is translated as God’s “<em>goodness</em>.” In the NKJV, it is translated as His “<em>lovingkindness</em>.” In the NIV, it is translated as “<em>my loving God</em>.” In the Berean Bible, it is translated as “<em>steadfast love</em>”. God’s wonderful, protective character can be described in many ways.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Before going into battle, put on the full armor of God</u>. David called God his “<em>fortress</em>,” his “<em>stronghold</em>,” and his “<em>shield</em>” (Ps. 144:2). Before facing your spiritual enemy, the Apostle Paul urges you to, “Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.” (Eph. 6:11). “The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let’s rid ourselves of the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” (Ro. 13:12). “But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.” (1 Thess. 5:8).</p></li>

<p>Take refuge in God, and He will be your shield of faith<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>With faith, God can be your shield against Satan</u>. David said that he took “<em>refuge</em>” in God (Ps. 144:2). In his song of deliverance, David also proclaimed that God is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; <em>He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him</em>.” (Ps. 18:30; 2 Sam. 22:31). Solomon made a similar revelation. “Every word of God is pure; <em>He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.</em>” (Prov. 30:5). When you make God your refuge, David also promises that God will protect you from evil. “For you have made the LORD, my refuge, the Most High, your dwelling place. <em>No evil will happen to you</em>, nor will any plague come near your tent.” (Ps. 91:9-10). God also made a similar declaration through Isaiah. ‘“No weapon that is formed against you will succeed; and you will condemn every tongue that accuses you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their vindication is from Me,’ declares the LORD.” (Is. 54:17).</p></li>

Ps. 144:3-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will never leave nor forsake you because He loves you</u>. David marveled at how the omnipotent Creator could love such weak and short-lived peoples. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, what is man, that You look after him? Or a son of man, that You think of him? <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Man is like the breath; his days are like a passing shadow</em>.” (Ps. 144:3-4). “It enhances our estimate of God’s goodness to consider the insignificance and unworthiness of the creatures on whom he bestows it.  His days are as a shadow that passes away … And yet God has regard to this weak creature of an hour.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 144:3-4).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His love for mankind</u>.  During his time of unexplainable suffering, Job questioned whether God did in fact love mankind:  “What is man that You exalt him, and that You are concerned about him,”  (Job 7:17).  But David and later the author of the book of Hebrews asked the same question and reached the opposite conclusion - - God’s miraculous love for mankind is greater than we can ever understand:  “What is man that You think of him, and a son of man that You are concerned about him?”  (Ps. 8:4). “But someone has testified somewhere, saying, ‘What is man, that you think of him?  Or a son of man, that you are concerned about Him?”’  (Heb. 2:6).  The fact that He would send His only begotten son to die for us is proof of His love (Jo. 3:16). </p></li>

<p>Have faith in Jesus’ love for you, and He will cast out your fears<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Focusing on God’s love will cast out your fear in spiritual warfare</u>. Your enemy tries to fill you with fear. But you can cast out that fear by focusing on God’s love for you. “There is no fear in love, but <em>perfect love drives out fear</em>, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.” (1 Jo. 4:18). “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and <em>love</em> and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To succeed in spiritual warfare, show to others the love that God has given you</u>. With the love that God gives you, you are in turn called upon to love and encourage one another in battle. “Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor,” (Ro. 12:10). “But encourage one another every day, as long as it is still called ‘today,’ so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (Heb. 3:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To succeed in spiritual warfare, don’t become distracted by the things of the flesh</u>. As part of his admiration for God, David noted how short mankind’s life is (Ps. 144:4). Another psalmist made a similar observation as part of his lament about his suffering. “My days are like a lengthened shadow, and I wither away like grass.” (Ps. 102:11). Because life is short, mankind is warned not to squander it on things of the flesh that quickly pass. “A voice says, ‘Call out.’ Then he answered, ‘What shall I call out?’ All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; the people are indeed grass!” (Is. 40:6-7). In contrast, God’s Word stands forever (1 Pet. 1:24-25). Thus, in spiritual warfare, you should avoid becoming distracted by the things of the flesh. Instead, you should focus on God’s eternal Word and how best to serve Him. “And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (Eph. 6:17).</p></li>

<h2 id="gods-power-with-faith-gods-power-will-vanquish-your-enemy-in-any-type-of-spiritual-warfare.-ps.-1445-8."><strong>4. <u>God’s Power: With Faith, God’s Power Will Vanquish Your Enemy in Any Type of Spiritual Warfare</u>. Ps. 144:5-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>With faith, the full power of God can go before you in any spiritual battle</u>. David had the faith to call upon His omnipotent God to rain down His power from heaven and allow David’s army to succeed in battle. “<em><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Bend down Your heavens, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Flash forth lightning and scatter them; send out Your arrows and confuse them. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Reach out with Your hand from on high; rescue me and save me from great waters, from the hand of foreigners <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>whose mouth speaks deceit, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood</em>.” (Ps. 144:5-8). “The picture is figurative, describing divine intervention for judgment in terms of God’s coming down, as at Sinai … The psalmist was praying for some immediate deliverance. But the final answer to this prayer will undoubtedly be at the second coming of the Lord, when he does actually come down and destroy the wicked.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 144:5-8).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God wants to use His power to help you as well</u>.  In his song of deliverance, David used similar terms to describe God’s power. “<sup>7 </sup>Then the earth shook and quaked; and the foundations of the mountains were trembling and were shaken, because He was angry.  <sup>8 </sup>Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire from His mouth was devouring; coals burned from it.  <sup>9 </sup>He also bowed the heavens down low, and came down with thick darkness under His feet.  <sup>10 </sup>He rode on a cherub and flew; and He sped on the wings of the wind.  <sup>11 </sup>He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, darkness of waters, thick clouds.  <sup>12 </sup>From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, hailstones and coals of fire.  <sup>13</sup> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also<sup> </sup> thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.  <sup>14 </sup>He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, and lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.  <sup>15 </sup>Then the channels of water appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed by Your rebuke, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.”  (Ps. 18:7-15; 2 Sam. 22:8-16).  Other psalms also refer to God’s awesome power:  “The earth quaked; the heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God; Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel.”  (Ps. 66:8).  Moses used similar terms to describe God’s mighty power when He appeared at Mount Horeb / Sinai:  “Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.  When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.”  (Ex. 19:18-19).  The judge Deborah also used similar words in her song of deliverance to describe God:  “LORD, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the field of Edom, the earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, even the clouds dripped water.  The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, this Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.” (Jdgs. 5:4-5). “Mountains quake because of Him and the hills dissolve; indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, the world and all the inhabitants in it.”  (Nahum 1:5; Is. 64:1; Hab. 3:3-15).  God further uses His power to protect His people:  “Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel.  But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel.”  (1 Sam. 7:10).  He also wants to help you as well in spiritual warfare. All you need is faith in His power to help you.</p></li>

<p>Know and use God’s Word as your sword in spiritual warfare<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Reciting God’s Word is your sword in spiritual warfare</u>. In Psalm 144, David quoted or referenced his psalm of deliverance, Psalm 18, 18 times. As our example, David did this because God’s Word is your sword in spiritual warfare. “And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (Eph. 6:17). But this implies that you must know God’s Word to wield this sword in spiritual warfare.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s omnipotent power strengthen you in spiritual warfare</u>. Throughout the Bible, God repeatedly offers to strengthen His people for spiritual conflicts when they turn Him in faith. “The LORD will give strength to His people; ...” (Ps. 29:11). “He gives strength to the weary, and to the one who lacks might He increases power… Yet those who wait for the LORD will gain new strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.” (Is. 40:29, 31). “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.” (Eph. 6:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s power is perfected in your weakness</u>. In order for God to strengthen you, you cannot rely upon your own strength to succeed in spiritual warfare. “And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in distresses, in persecutions, in difficulties, in behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.” (2 Cor. 12:9-10).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="worship-through-worship-you-have-a-powerful-weapon-the-will-also-allow-you-to-succeed-in-spiritual-warfare.-ps.-1449-10."><strong>5. <u>Worship: Through Worship, You Have a Powerful Weapon The Will Also Allow You to Succeed in Spiritual Warfare</u>. Ps. 144:9-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through worship, you can weaken and drive away your spiritual enemy</u>. Before the battle began, David turned to worship God. This kept David focused and weakened his enemy. “<em><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>God, I will sing a new song to You; on a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You, <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>who gives salvation to kings, who rescues His servant David from the evil sword</em>.” (Ps. 144:9-10). “<a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1058723?ref=spiritual-warfare">After you have made a decision that is pleasing to God, the Devil may try to make you have second thoughts. Intensify your prayer time, meditation, and good deeds. For if Satan’s temptations merely cause you to increase your efforts to grow in holiness, he'll have an incentive to leave you alone.</a>” (Ignatius of Loyola).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>David’s worship music temporarily drove away Saul’s demonic possession</u>. When David first came to serve Saul, he saw the power of worship music in granting Saul temporary relief from his demonic possession. “So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would feel relieved and become well, and the evil spirit would leave him.” (1 Sam. 16:23). Thus, worship music is important in weakening or driving away your spiritual enemy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Worship was David’s weapon against Saul’s demonic possession<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to God’s power to boost your faith in times when it is weak</u>.  Like David, God wants you to trust in His absolute power to solve your problems.  He also wants you to boost your faith by including similar praises for His mighty power in your prayers and praises (Ro. 10:17).  ‘“Ah Lord GOD!  Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm!  Nothing is too difficult for You,’ . . . ‘Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”’  (Jer. 32:17, 27).  “And looking at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’  (Matt. 19:26; Gen. 18:14).  If God does not respond to your prayer requests, it may be because you are asking amiss or it is not His will.  Yet, if He does not respond, it will never be because He lacks the power to do so.  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing a “new song” to praise God</u>.  David frequently worshiped with stringed instruments (e.g., 1 Sam. 16:18; 17:34-36; 23:24-29). Here, he proclaimed, “I will sing a <em>new song</em> to You, O God; …” (Ps. 144:9). Similar declarations appear throughout the Bible:  “Sing to Him a <em>new song</em>; play skillfully with a shout of joy.”  (Ps. 33:3).  “He put a<em> new song</em> in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; many will see and fear and will trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Ps.  40:3). “<em>Sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> a new song;</em>”  (Ps. 96:1).  “Sing a <em>new song</em> to the LORD, for He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.”  (Ps. 98:1).  “Praise the LORD!  Sing <em>a new song</em> to the LORD, and His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.”  (Ps. 149:1).  “Sing to the LORD a <em>new song</em>,  . . .”  (Is. 42:10).  “And they sang a <em>new song</em>, . . .”  (Rev. 5:9a).  Are you continually singing new praises to Jesus?  Or, has your praise for Him become stagnant?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Through prayer, turn to God for your deliverance</u>. David then turned to God in prayer and pleaded for God to deliver him and allow him to succeed in battle against Israel’s more numerous foreign enemies. “<em><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Rescue me and save me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouth speaks deceit and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When our sons in their youth are like growing plants, and our daughters like corner pillars fashioned for a palace, <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>our granaries are full, providing every kind of produce, and our flocks deliver thousands and ten thousands in our fields; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>may our cattle be bred without mishap and without loss, may there be no outcry in our streets!</em>” (Ps. 144:11-15). “Prayer is again made for a continuance of God’s favor, and a complete victory over every enemy; the happy consequences of which, in the establishment of Israel and the prosperity of Jerusalem, are described.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Ps. 144:11).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God gave David victory over the foreign, pagan nations that threatened Israel</u>. David cried out: “<em><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Rescue me and save me from the hand of foreigners,</em>” (Ps. 144:11). God promised to make a great name out of David: “I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth.” (2 Sam. 7:9). Through God’s faithfulness and His grace, God empowered David’s soldiers to defeat four foreign armies that threatened Israel. First, after defeating the Philistines at Gath (2 Sam. 8:1), David’s soldiers conquered the nation of Moab in modern day Jordan (2 Sam. 8:2; 1 Chron. 18:2). Second, his army then defeated two Aramean armies from Syria where he captured 20,000 soldiers and killed 22,000 others (2 Sam. 8:3-8; 1 Chon. 18:3-8) Third, David’s soldiers then defeated 18,000 Arameans at the Valley of Salt, south of the Dead Sea (2 Sam. 8:13; 1 Chron. 18:12). Finally, David conquered the nation of Edom, also in Jordan (2 Sam. 8:14; 1 Chron. 18:13). In his psalm of deliverance, David declared “I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and I did not turn back until they were consumed.” (Ps. 18:37; 144:10). When God delivers you, also make sure that you give Him the glory,</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Turn to God when you are in need of deliverance</u>. As our example, David turned to God to deliver and rescue him whenever he was under attack. “Arise, LORD; <em>save me</em>, my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.” (Ps. 3:7). “Arise, LORD, confront him, make him bow down; <em>save my soul</em> from the wicked with Your sword,” (Ps. 17:13). “Return, LORD, <em>rescue my soul; save me</em> because of Your mercy.” (Ps. 6:4). “The God who executes vengeance for me, and brings down peoples under me, who also brings me out from my enemies; You also raise me above those who rise up against me; <em>You rescue me</em> from the violent person. Therefore I will give thanks to You, LORD, among the nations, and I will sing praises to Your name.” (Ps. 18:47-49; 2 Sam. 22:48-50). “A Psalm of David. In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be ashamed; in Your righteousness <em>deliver me</em>. Incline Your ear to me<em>,</em> <em>rescue me quickly</em>; be a rock of strength for me, a stronghold to save me. . . . My times are in Your hand; <em>rescue me</em> from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me …” (Ps. 31:1-2, 15). “O <em>give us help</em> against the adversary, <em>for deliverance by man is in vain</em>.” (Ps. 60:11). “<em>Save me</em>, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the wrongdoer and the ruthless,” (Ps. 71:4). A Psalm of David. <em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Rescue me, </em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, from evil people; protect me from violent men” (Ps. 140:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for God’s deliverance to bless His people</u>. David prayed for God’s deliverance to bless all of society (Ps. 144:12-15). “David prayed for a series of blessings that would come among God’s people when God dealt with the evil speakers in their midst. The list of blessings focuses on the concerns of everyday people in farming societies: · Blessed with children in the home; well-rooted and flourishing <strong>sons</strong>, and stable and stately <strong>daughters</strong>.· Blessed in the work of their hands, with <strong>barns</strong> full, <strong>ten thousands</strong> of <strong>sheep</strong>, and <strong>oxen</strong> burdened with heavy harvests. · Blessed with safety and peace in the community, with no violence (<strong>breaking in or going out</strong>) or riot over injustice (<strong>outcry in our streets</strong>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 144:12-14) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> After conquering these pagan nations that threatened Israel, David reigned with justice and righteousness. Through David, God brought peace to Israel (2 Sam. 8:15-18; 1 Chron. 18:14-17). This also fulfilled God’s promises to the Jews in Leviticus 26:1-13 and Deuteronomy 28:1-14.</p></li>

<h2 id="trust-to-succeed-in-spiritual-warfare-put-your-trust-in-god.-ps.-14415."><strong>7. <u>Trust: To Succeed in Spiritual Warfare, Put Your Trust in God</u>. Ps. 144:15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Thank God for the blessings that God offers you in spiritual warfare</u>. David concluded by thanking God for the blessings that He had graciously given His people to succeed. “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Blessed are the people who are so situated; blessed are the people whose God is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 144:15). In the NASB, the word (<span dir="rtl">אַשְׁרֵ֣י</span>) (’aš·rê) is translated as “<em>blessed</em>.” The NIV and the Berean Bibles also adopt the same translation. But the KJB and the NKJV translate this word as “happy.” The blessing or happiness comes from trusting in God and showing gratitude when He delivers you. David showed himself a man after God’s heart (Acts 13:22) by refusing to keep the spoils of war for himself. Instead, he gave them to God (2 Sam. 8:9-12; 1 Chron. 18:9-11). “The subjects of the Saviour, the Son of David, share the blessings of his authority and victories, and are happy because they have the Lord for their God.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 144:15).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Put your trust in God, even when His plans are unknown</u>. Even when it seems that evil is prevailing, God wants you to trust that He is in control and has a greater plan for good: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “Casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1 Pet. 5:7). “Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” (1 Cor. 16:13). “Be strong and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in the LORD.” (Ps. 31:24). “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6). Even if an evil person tries to kill you, your soul remains protected with Jesus: “I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.” (Lk. 12:4). The only person that you are to fear is God (Prov. 1:7). And the fear of the Lord is hating evil (Prov. 8:12). Even when evil seems to prevail, do you trust God?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus blesses those who trust in Him</u>. Jesus also promises that you will be blessed when you trust Him for your every need. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great;” (Matt. 5:3-12).</p></li>
