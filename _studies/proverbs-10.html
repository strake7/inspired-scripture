<p><u>Introduction</u>: Following his nine-chapter prolong, Proverbs 10 begins Solomon’s proverbs. Sadly, only a small percentage of Solomon’s 3,000 God-given proverbs (1 Kgs. 4:32) are found within his collection (Prov. 10:1-29:27). A proverb is a God-given principle for living wisely. Each proverb is stated in a single, two-phrase sentence. Through Jesus, the wisdom of the Triune God is made known to mankind. “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, <em>who became to us wisdom from God</em>, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus came to fulfill God’s Word, including the Law, all prophecy, and offer salvation (Matt. 5:17). To save the lost, Jesus shared His wisdom through His teachings (Mk. 1:21-22, 6:6). His wisdom teachings included His parables (e.g., Matt. 13:13). The Greek word “parabole” (παραβολή) is a translation of the Hebrew word “mashal” (<span dir="rtl">מָשָׁל</span>) or “proverb”.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> He taught wisdom parables to the crowds (Matt 13:10-17). But he revealed their hidden meanings to His disciples (Matt. 13:11). Jesus also wants you to become His disciple (Lk. 9:23). If you will search out what He offers, He will share His wisdom with you. “It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.” (Prov. 25:2). In Proverbs 10, Solomon reveals seven principals for having the wisdom to walk in blessed relationships with Jesus and others as Jesus intended for you. These include: (1) honoring your parents, (2) integrity in work and personal relationships, (3) speaking truth out of love; (4) trusting God over wealth, (5) restraining your heart from hatred; (6) faith in Jesus, and (7) fearing Jesus by hating evil.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon began his proverbs with a call for children to honor their parents. Jesus intended for parents to pass along the wisdom of His Word to the next generation. Thus, parents have an important job in teaching and modeling Jesus’ wisdom, and children have an important role in listening to and following godly instruction. <u>Second</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon urged believers to walk in integrity in their work and personal relationships. If you seek first Jesus’ will instead of trying to get ahead through dishonest gain, Jesus will provide for your needs. Your relationships with others will also be blessed when you walk with integrity. <u>Third</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon urges believers to avoid all forms of deceit and lies. Jesus urges believers to only speak the truth out of love. <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon warns believers to place their trust in God and not in their wealth. Jesus wants you to seek first His Kingdom and trust Him to provide. <u>Fifth</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon also warns believers to their hearts from hatred. Jesus warns that your unrestrained hearts ultimately defile you when you speak evil. <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon promised that Yahweh provides blessings without sorrow. If you have the faith to focus on doing Jesus’ will, He will bless you with provision and bless your relationships. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon concluded by extolling a life that fears Yahweh, which he defined as hating evil. If you avoid what Jesus calls evil and cling to good, He will bless your relationships with Him and others. You will then live in peace and harmony with Him and others around you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>True wisdom should be taught and followed within families</u>. Solomon began his proverbs with a call for children to heed the God-given wisdom taught through their parents. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother</em>.” (Prov. 10:1). Israel was God’s “kingdom of priests” (Exod. 19:6). This meant that every person had a role in sharing God’s wisdom. Because no schools existed in Old Testament times, instruction regarding wisdom began within the families. Moses commanded parents to teach their children the Ten Commandments and the interpretive rules in the home (Dt. 6:7-9). In Proverbs, children are urged to follow the godly instruction of their parents (Prov. 1:8-9; 6:20: 10:1). This also means that God meant for families to study the Word together. Thus, “It is perhaps significant that the first proverb deals with so fundamental a relation of human society.” (Thomas Thomason Perowne (1899), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on. Prov. 10:1).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Children must honor their parents, and parents must honor Jesus by teaching His Word<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God intended for the family to teach new generations of believers to walk in faith</u>. A child’s obedience to godly family instruction is so important to God that it is the first of His Ten Commandments that relate to how humans interact with each other. “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged on the land which the LORD your God gives you.” (Ex. 20:12). “Honor your father and your mother, just as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well for you on the land which the LORD your God is giving you.” (Dt. 5:16). “Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, ...” (Lev. 19:3a). This wisdom principle is also repeated throughout the New Testament as well. “Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.” (Col. 3:20). “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may turn out well for you, and that you may live long on the earth.” (Eph. 6:1-3; Matt. 15:4; 19:19; Mk. 7:10; 10:19; Lk. 18:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A wise child honors their parents when they serve God</u>. Solomon’s first proverb is so foundational to wise living and having blessed relationships that it is repeated three more times in Proverbs. “A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother.” (Prov. 15:20). “A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her who gave birth to him.” (Prov. 17:25). “The eye that mocks a father and scorns a mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it.” (Prov. 30:17).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrity-have-integrity-in-work-and-personal-relationships.-prov.-102-9."><strong>2. <u>Integrity: Have Integrity in Work and Personal Relationships</u>. Prov. 10:2-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Have integrity in work and the pursuit of wealth</u>. In the first of several proverbs related to integrity, Solomon urged believers to walk with integrity in their business dealings and in the pursuit of worldly wealth. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Ill-gotten gains do not benefit,</em> <em>but righteousness rescues from death</em>.” (Prov. 10:2). Believers should instead live righteously and trust God to provide for all their worldly needs. “The Hebrew word translated ‘righteousness’ has a much wider meaning than its English equivalent, which generally bears the sense only of deciding fairly, being especially applied to judges. But a ‘righteous’ man in Hebrew is one who ‘renders to all their due,’ whether to God, as Noah, who was ‘just and perfect’ before Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm"><u>Genesis 6:9</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm"><u>Genesis 7:1</u></a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm"><u>Ecclesiastes 7:20</u></a>), or to man.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 10:2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Guard your heart from all forms of greed and the love of money</u>. Jesus repeatedly warns that greed is the root of many evils that will harm your relationships with both Him and others around you. “But He said to them, ‘Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one is affluent does his life consist of his possessions.’ (Lk. 12:15). “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” (1Tim. 6:9-10). “Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, ‘I will never desert you, nor will I ever abandon you,’” (Heb. 13:5). “For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26; Mk. 8:36-37).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Store up your treasures in heaven and not on Earth</u>. You can live righteously by trusting Jesus to provide for your needs. “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will provide for your needs in His perfect timing</u>. Solomon revealed that Yahweh’s intention is to protect the righteous from hunger according to His perfect will and His timing. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will not allow the righteous to hunger, but He will reject the craving of the wicked</em>.” (Prov. 10:3). “Though the righteous may be poor, the Lord will not suffer him to want what is needful for spiritual life.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 10:2-3).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Seek first Jesus’ Kingdom, and He will provide for your worldly needs<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus does not want any to suffer, but suffering is sometimes necessary for His plans</u>. Similar statements of God’s intent are found in the Psalms. “I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his descendants begging for bread.” (Ps. 37:25). “The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:10). “For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.” (Ps. 84:11). But Jesus’ provision is according to His will and timing. The book of Job provides an example of how the righteous must sometimes suffer as part of God’s greater plans (Ro. 8:28). When this happens, we must trust Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust Jesus to provide for your needs, not your wants</u>. Even if Jesus’ plans for you include some suffering, you can trust Him to provide for your needs. “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). “Do not worry then, saying, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear for clothing?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:31-33; Lk. 12:29-31). If you desire what He wants for you, you will receive your desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Labor diligently for Jesus with the talents that He provides for you</u>. Solomon also urged believers to show integrity in their work attitudes by laboring diligently for God’s Kingdom when they are physically able to do so. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich</em>. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully</em>.” (Prov. 10:4-5). “All this is true in a spiritual sense; such who are slothful in attendance on the means of grace, the word and ordinances, are slack and negligent in duty, bring a spiritual poverty upon them; and like the Laodicean church, who, through her lukewarmness and carnal security, became poor and wretched, blind and naked: on the other hand, such who are diligent in the use of means are frequent at the throne of grace, forsake not the assembly of the saints, constantly wait at Wisdom's gates; these grow rich in grace and in all good works.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 10:4).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Work diligently for Jesus</u>. Solomon later repeated his warnings against being slothful. “The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor.” (Prov. 12:24). “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). “Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger.” (Prov. 19:15). “The lazy one does not plow after the autumn, so he begs during the harvest and has nothing.” (Prov. 20:4). “The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work;” (Prov. 21:25). “Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks.” (Ecc. 10:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t squander Jesus’ gifts</u>. Jesus has given every person gifts or talents. He warns against failing to use His gifts or talents for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘You worthless, lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who live with integrity</u>. When your faith-led righteousness is lived out without deception, Jesus will bless you. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence</em>.” (Prov. 10:6). “This is usually explained to mean either that the consciousness of his own iniquity silences the sinner when he would speak against the righteous, or his violence and injustice, returning on his own head, are like a bandage over his mouth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-45.htm"><u>Leviticus 13:45</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm"><u>Micah 3:7</u></a>), reducing him to shame and silence … The contrast is between the manifest blessedness of the righteous and the secret sinister proceedings of the evil.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 10:6).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus’ righteousness light be visible to others through your integrity</u>. If you are living according to Jesus’ wisdom, integrity should be the fruit of your faith. “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and <em>so</em> lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, free of hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.” (Jam. 3:13-18). Your integrity blesses your relationships with Jesus and with others. Your integrity also allows you to bless others by Jesus’ light to the lost (Matt. 5:14-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who live with integrity will be remembered and celebrated</u>. Solomon further promised that believers who live with integrity will be blessed while the names of the wicked will quickly be forgotten. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The mentioning of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot</em>.” (Prov. 10:7). “The heroes of faith in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Hebrews+11&amp;t=NKJV">Hebrews 11</a> are good examples of righteous men and women whose memory is <strong>blessed</strong> … If the wicked are remembered at all, it will be as a stinking, rotten thing. Our present path in a <strong>righteous</strong> direction or in a <strong>wicked</strong> direction will end either in blessedness or rottenness, each answering to the path. Every man and woman can choose if they will be remembered to praise or remembered to shame.” (David Guzik on Prov. 10:7).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Live out your life with integrity so that others may celebrate your faith</u>. A righteous person will be remembered forever. “For he will never be shaken; the righteous will be remembered forever.” (Ps. 112:6). Jesus will be faithful to remember and celebrate your good deeds in heaven (Matt. 6:19-21). Thus, every person should seek the blessings that come from living a life of integrity. “A good name is to be more desired than great wealth; favor is better than silver and gold.” (Prov. 22:1). “A good name is better than good oil, and the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.” (Ecc. 7:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person with integrity submits to God’s commands</u>. A person is not born with integrity. Instead, integrity begins with the wisdom to follow God’s Commandments. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The wise of heart will receive commands, but a babbling fool will come to ruin</em>.” (Prov. 10:8). “<strong>Will receive commandments; </strong>is ready to hear and obey the counsels and precepts of God, and of men, by which means he shall stand fast and live. <strong>A prating fool; </strong>one who is slow to hear and swift to speak, who, instead of receiving good admonitions, cavils and disputes against them.” (Matthew Poole’s Commentary on Prov. 10:8).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. Solomon gave similar advice in other proverbs. “A wise person will hear and increase in learning, and a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel,” (Prov. 1:5). “Listen to advice and accept discipline, so that you may be wise the rest of your days.” (Prov. 19:20). Your faith should produce obedience. “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” (Jam. 2:17). A believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. But He is not your Lord if you disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt. 7:26). Jesus also warned: “For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who live with integrity can live in peace with Jesus and others</u>. As an added benefit to living with integrity, you never need to worry about hiding secrets. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>One who walks in integrity walks securely, but one who perverts his ways will be found out</em>.” (Prov. 10:9). Unlike those who live with integrity, the wicked cannot live at peace in their surroundings. “His wickedness shall be publicly discovered, and so he shall be exposed to all that shame and punishment which his sins deserve, and which he thought by his craft and subtlety to avoid.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 10:9).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Walk with integrity, and Jesus will bless your relationships<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God promises peace and a secure foundation for those who live with integrity</u>. Even though you live in a fallen world, Jesus promises that you will enjoy His eternal peace when you are transformed with His integrity. “A Psalm of David. LORD, who may reside in Your tent? Who may settle on Your holy hill? One who walks with integrity, practices righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart.” (Ps. 15:1-2). “One who walks righteously and speaks with integrity, one who rejects unjust gain and shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe; one who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed and shuts his eyes from looking at evil; He will dwell on the heights, His refuge will be the impregnable rock; His bread will be given him, His water will be sure.” (Is. 33:15-16).3.</p></li>

<h2 id="truth-speak-in-love-and-truth-avoid-all-forms-of-deceit.-prov.-1010-14."><strong>3. <u>Truth: Speak in Love and Truth Avoid All Forms of Deceit</u>. Prov. 10:10-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A wise person speaks Jesus’ truth</u>. Those who speak deceitfully will reap what they sow. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>He who winks the eye causes trouble, and a babbling fool will come to ruin</em>.” (Prov. 10:10). “When you see a man say something and wink, it means he doesn’t mean what he said. His mouth and his mind are not in agreement. When they are not in agreement, it will cause a great deal of sorrow. Whom does this verse fit? How about Judas? The kiss of Judas certainly was a kiss of betrayal. The kiss is meant to demote affection, but it certainly didn’t mean that for him.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 10:10).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Live with integrity by speaking Jesus’ truth in love</u>. Deceit is an abomination to God. “Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, but those who deal faithfully are His delight.” (Prov. 12:22). Without Jesus’ atonement, those who tell lies cannot inherit eternal life in heaven. “One who practices deceit shall not dwell within my house; one who speaks lies shall not maintain his position before me.” (Ps. 101:7). Even after you become a saved believer, you are encouraged to live with integrity by removing all deceit and lies from your walk. “Therefore, ridding yourselves of falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, because we are parts of one another.” (Eph. 4:25). “Do not lie to one another, since you stripped off the old self with its evil practices,” (Col. 3:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a witness to Jesus’ hope of eternal life</u>. If you are living in Jesus’ wisdom, His hope of salvation should be evident in your words. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence</em>.” (Prov. 10:11). “The mouth of an upright man is like a spring that is bubbling over with strong words of wisdom that will strengthen and encourage the hearer, if followed.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 10:11).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Avoid and deceit</u>. Believers are to abstain from all types of evil speech. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6). When you speak the truth, do so with gentleness. “but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, but with gentleness and respect;” (1 Pet. 3:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Speaking forgiveness brings Jesus’ forgiveness</u>. In a foreshadow of the New Testament, Solomon promised that those who speak with loving forgiveness can cover sins forgiven. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses</em>.” (Prov. 10:12). “This proverb examines how we treat those who have wronged us. Two possibilities are revealed: one leads to violence and further conflict, the other to reconciliation and harmony. When wronged, we can respond in hate or in love … In today’s culture of mass communication, we possess the power to expose anyone’s sin or weakness to millions of people. Sometimes such public shaming may achieve just ends, but most often it unleashes a monster that can destroy a person unmercifully and without due process. And unlike God’s forgiveness, which includes his promise to forget the penitent’s sins, the internet never forgets.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 10:12).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-10/media/image4.jpg" style="width:6.03892in;height:2.11503in" /></p>
<p>Forgive others out of love, and Jesus will forgive your offenses out of love<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Love covers a multitude of sins</u>. You speak with Jesus’ wisdom when you share His love and forgive others. “For if you forgive other people for their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive other people, then your Father will not forgive your offenses.” (Matt. 16:14-15). “Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8). “In addition to all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.” (Col. 3:14). “If I speak with the tongues of mankind and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.” (1 Cor. 13:1). “Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law.” (Ro. 13:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let truth be the fruit of your faith</u>. Solomon stated that a person can either be blessed with the wisdom to speak truth or suffer by speaking false, foolish words. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>On the lips of the discerning, wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who has no sense</em>. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>Wise people store up knowledge, but with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand</em>.” (Prov. 10:13-14). “[v. 10:13] The wisdom of the wise is seen in the words that issue from his lips; the folly of the fool is not only seen in his speech, but brings upon him the chastisement which he well deserves. [v. 10:14] The point of the maxim is that the wise man reserves what he has to say for the right time, place, and persons (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm"><u>Matthew 7:6</u></a>), as contrasted with the foolish, ever giving immediate utterance to what destroys himself and others.” (Albert Barnes, Notes on the Bible, Prov. 10:13-14).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Evil words can lead to ruin</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned against speaking evil things. “One who guards his mouth protects his life; one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.” (Prov. 13:3). “The tongue of the wise makes knowledge pleasant, but the mouth of fools spouts foolishness.” (Prov. 15:2). “A fool’s mouth is his ruin, and his lips are the snare of his soul.” (Prov. 18:7). “Do not be quick with your mouth or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.” (Ecc. 5:2). Jesus also warns that each person will one day be held accountable to their words. “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37).</p></li>

<h2 id="trusting-god-place-your-trust-in-god-and-not-in-wealth.-prov.-1015-17."><strong>4. <u>Trusting God: Place Your Trust in God and Not in Wealth</u>. Prov. 10:15-17.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who trust in wealth instead of trusting in Jesus can be led astray</u>. If you fail to place your trust in Jesus for your provision, both extreme wealth and extreme poverty can be a snare in your walk with Him. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The rich person’s wealth is his fortress,</em> <em>the ruin of the poor is their poverty</em>.” (Prov. 10:15). “Both by trusting in ‘uncertain riches’ (1 Ti 6:17), or by the evils of poverty (Pr 30:9), men, not fearing God, fall into dangers.” (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Prov. 10:15).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not place your trust in wealth</u>. Solomon warns against those who trust in riches. “One who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will flourish like the green leaf.” (Prov. 11:28). “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). Covetousness can never be satisfied. “One who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor one who loves abundance with its income. This too is futility.” (Ecc. 5:10). Jesus also warns that you cannot trust in your wealth to find salvation. “For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul? For what could a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Mk. 8:36-37; Matt. 16:26; Lk. 9:25). “knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.” (1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for moderation so keep your eyes on Jesus</u>. Agur had the wisdom to pray for neither wealth nor poverty so that he would not turn from God. “Keep deception and lies far from me, Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is my portion, so that I will not be full and deny You and say, ‘Who is the LORD?’ And that I will not become impoverished and steal, and profane the name of my God.” (Prov. 30:8-9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in Jesus and labor for Him</u>. Solomon promised that those who labor for Yahweh find life, while those who trust in the wages of the flesh find only death. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>The wages of the righteous is life, the income of the wicked, punishment</em>.” (Prov. 10:16). “ Honest labor brings its own reward in the blessing of God and a long and peaceful life. The fruit of the wicked. All the profit that the wicked make they use in the service of sin, which tends only to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 10:16).<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus offers the narrow path to eternal life<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Focus of Jesus’ Kingdom and find life</u>. Paul encourages believers to labor for Jesus as directed by the Spirit and find life. Those who live for the flesh find only death. “For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:8). “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Allow the Spirit to correct you to stay on the right path</u>. When you trust in wealth, you must accept correction. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>One who is on the path of life follows instruction, but one who ignores a rebuke goes astray</em>.” (Prov. 10:17). “This verse speaks loudly about the importance of guidance and learning from our mistakes. When we hear the word ‘instruction,’ we can think of it as a form of teaching. Whether this comes from a parent, a teacher, or even a guardian, it offers valuable lessons essential to our growth. When we heed instruction, we are essentially listening and willing to learn. This becomes our pathway to life. It means that we are not only focused on our own growth but also on how we interact with other people in our lives.” (Jamie Wilson on Prov. 10:17).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God loves those whom He corrects and disciplines</u>. To be wise, you must be willing to accept Spirit-led correction when you fall into sin. “One who loves discipline loves knowledge, but one who hates rebuke is stupid.” (Prov. 12:1). “One whose ear listens to a life-giving rebuke will stay among the wise. One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding.” (Prov. 15:31-32). Jesus shows His love for you when He disciplines you. “One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding.” (Rev. 3:19).</p></li>

<h2 id="restraint-restrain-your-heart-from-hatred-and-slander.-prov.-1018-21."><strong>5. <u>Restraint: Restrain Your Heart From Hatred and Slander</u>. Prov. 10:18-21.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Control your heart from all forms of hatred</u>. Solomon condemned both concealed anger and anger that is acted upon through slander. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>One who conceals hatred has lying lips,</em> a<em>nd one who spreads slander is a fool</em>.” (Prov. 10:18). “[H]e condemns two opposite vices, secret hatred and manifest slander.” (Joseph Benson on Prov. 10:18).<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for Jesus to clean your heart and restrain your tongue</u>. If evil is unrestrained in your heart, it will eventually be acted upon and defile you. “It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles the person.” (Matt. 15:11). “If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this person’s religion is worthless.” (Jam. 1:26). Thus, you should pray for Jesus to clean your heart of evil and transform you. “Create in me a clean heart, God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.” (Ps. 51:10; Ro. 12:2). You should also pray for the strength to guard your both heart and mouth. “Set a guard, LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.” (Ps. 141:3). “One who guards his mouth protects his life; one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.” (Prov. 13:3). “One who guards his mouth and his tongue, guards his soul from troubles.” (Prov. 21:23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Restrain your tongue from unnecessary speech that might inadvertently hurt others</u>. In tense circumstances where disputes exist, a wise person not only seeks to retrain intentionally hurtful speech, but also unnecessary words that might negligently cause harm. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>When there are many words, wrongdoing is unavoidable, but one who restrains his lips is wise</em>.” (Prov. 10:19). “[M]any words do not mend a fault. Silence on the part of both the reprover and the offender is often better.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 10:10).<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be careful with your words</u>. Believers must be careful about saying too many things in circumstances where words might unintentionally cause harm. “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;” (Jam. 1:19). “One who withholds his words has knowledge, and one who has a cool spirit is a person of understanding. Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is considered prudent.” (Prov. 17:27-28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you speak, bless and encourage others</u>. To live in blessed relationships, you should speak words that heal, uplift, and direct others to the truth and hope found in Jesus. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver, the heart of the wicked is worth little</em>. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of understanding</em>.” (Prov. 10:20-21). “The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.” (Matthew Henry, Prov. 10:20-21).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-10/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.016in;height:1.84867in" alt="Encourage One Another" /></p>
<p>Use the speech that Jesus gives you to offer His hope to those who are lost or in need<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be Jesus’ ambassador with your words and speech</u>. With the power of the Holy Spirit, you can speak life into others. “Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.” (1 Thess. 5:11). “So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.” (Ro. 14:19). “Pursue peace with all people, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.” (Heb. 12:14).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faith-focus-on-jesus-and-have-faith-in-his-provision.-prov.-1022-26."><strong>6. <u>Faith: Focus on Jesus, and Have Faith in His Provision</u>. Prov. 10:22-26.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ riches, which bring no sorrow</u>. While covetousness can damage your relationships with both Jesus and others, a life spent pursuing Jesus’ will brings joy and contentment. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>It is the blessing of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> that makes rich,</em> a<em>nd He adds no sorrow to it</em>.” (Prov. 10:22). “There are many who have been blessed with riches and are wise enough to receive those riches as God’s blessing. They understand that <em>every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights</em> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=James+1.17&amp;t=NKJV"><u>James 1:17</u></a>) … <strong>He adds no sorrow with it</strong>: This is a greater blessing upon a smaller blessing. To receive riches from God is to be blessed; to have riches without the <strong>sorrow</strong> that often come with them is an even greater blessing. There are many rich people who are miserable and have great <strong>sorrow</strong> along with their riches.” (David Guzik, Prov. 10:22).<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Have the faith to know that God will provide when you do His will</u>. The Jews wealth came from God. “But you are to remember the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, in order to confirm His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day.” (Dt. 8:18). Unless it was His will, their labors would not last. “A Song of Ascents, of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds a house, they who build it labor in vain; ….” (Ps. 127:1a). Thus, Jesus encourages believers to focus on doing His will and having faith in His provision. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person of faith seeks to show Jesus’ love to others</u>. A person should seek to live out their faith by treating others with love. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, and so is wisdom to a person of understanding</em>.” (Prov. 10:23). “[H]ere denotes committing any crass offense against people and community. <em>To a fool</em> such offenses are <em>like [the pleasure of] laughter</em>. What is an abomination to the righteous is amusement to the fool. In contrast, <em>wisdom</em>, which entails serving God and community, gives delightful pleasure <em>to an understanding person</em>.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs).<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Love others just as Jesus loves</u>. When you have faith in Jesus, your love for your neighbor should be part of the fruit of your faith. “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.”” (Jo. 13:34-35). “Love is patient, love is kind, … it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;” (1 Cor. 13:4a, 6). Jesus will then bless your relationships.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you delight yourself in Jesus’ will, He will give your heart’s desires</u>. While those who pursue dishonest gain will live in fear of being caught, those who seek to do Jesus’ will have their prayers answered. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>What the wicked fears will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted</em>.” (Prov. 10:24). “<strong>The desire of the righteous shall be granted.—</strong>For they submit their will to the will of God, and pray for what He sees best for them, which accordingly He grants; moreover, the Holy Spirit also aids them, making intercession for them “according to the will of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm"><u>Romans 8:27</u></a>).” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 10:24).<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Live your life seeking to do Jesus’ will, and He will bless you</u>. Selfish gain damages relationships. If you instead delight yourself in doing Jesus’ will, He will bless you. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). “This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us <em>in</em> whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.” (1 Jo. 5:14-15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Invest in Jesus’ Kingdom, which will last forever</u>. Many invest their time into worldly things. But these things will quickly pass away. In contrast, the wise invest their time, talent, and resources into Jesus’ eternal Kingdom. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, but the righteous has an everlasting foundation</em>.” (Prov. 10:25). “<strong>When the whirlwind passeth the wicked</strong> is <strong>no more</strong>. The parallelism is thus best preserved. Like the house on the sand when the whirlwind passes over it, the wicked shall be swept away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-10.htm"><u>Psalm 37:10</u></a>): like the house on the rock unshaken by the storm, the righteous shall stand firm as “an everlasting foundation.” (Thomas Thomason Perowne (1899), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on. Prov. 10:25).<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you invest in Jesus’ Kingdom, your investment will survive all worldly trials</u>. Jesus stated that a wise person who follows His Words will not see their investments washed away during worldly trials and tribulations. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:24-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fail to use their talents for Jesus’ Kingdom will face His judgment</u>. In addition to forgoing a blessing, those who squander Jesus’ gifts will be held to account for their displeasing actions. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy one to those who send him</em>.” (Prov. 10:26). “[S]lothful and unprofitable servants, to whom talents are given for usefulness, which they hide or use not, are very provoking to Christ, and whom he will order into outer darkness; those who have gifts for sacred service ought not to be slothful in business, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-26.htm"><u>Matthew 25:26</u></a>.” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 10:26).<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t squander Jesus’ gifts</u>. Jesus has given every person gifts or talents. He warns against failing to use His gifts or talents for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30).</p></li>

<h2 id="fearing-jesus-fear-jesus-by-hating-evil-and-doing-good.-prov.-1027-32."><strong>7. <u>Fearing Jesus: Fear Jesus by Hating Evil, and Doing Good</u>. Prov. 10:27-32.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you fear Jesus and avoid evil, He will prolong your life</u>. Solomon then restated that true wisdom and the blessing of a prolonged life all depend fearing Yahweh. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> prolongs life,</em> <em>but the years of the wicked will be shortened</em>.” (Prov. 10:27). “What man is he that loves life? Let him fear God, and that will secure to him life enough in this world, and eternal life in the other.” (Matthew Henry, Prov. 10:27).<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by hating evil brings the blessings of both a prolonged life and eternal life</u>. The prologue to Proverbs began and concluded with Solomon’s revelation that “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10). The fear of Yahweh is defined as “hating” what He calls evil (Prov. 8:13). Those who keep God’s Commandments out of love (and not obligation) will also be blessed with a prolonged life (Dt. 5:33; 6:2; 11:9; Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16; Eph. 6:2-3).  With the authority given to him, Solomon repeated these promises to both his son and to all mankind (Prov. 3:1-2).  This does not mean that you will live until you are old.  You could die at any moment.  But Jesus promises to “prolong” your life when your faith leads to obedience.  You may have an extra minute, a week, a year, a decade, or some other increment of time added to your lifetime.  Only when you get to heaven will you learn of the amount of time that Jesus has added to your life out of loving grace. And, in addition to a prolonged life, faith in Jesus brings eternal life (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus by avoiding evil brings the joy of the Spirit</u>. If you focus on the things of Spirit and avoid the sorrows that come from embracing evil, Jesus offers you joy. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>The hope of the righteous is gladness, but the expectation of the wicked perishes</em>.” (Prov. 10:28). “The expectant waiting of the righteous is joyful at the time, and ends in joy: the eager hope of the wicked comes to nought.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 10:28).<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Through faith in Jesus, you have the joy of the Spirit and the assurance of salvation<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fruit of a life that avoids evil and obeys the Holy Spirit includes joy</u>. If you fear Jesus by avoiding evil and cling to good, the Holy Spirit will give you peace and joy. “Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Ro. 15:13). “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Gal. 5:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus by avoiding evil brings His protection</u>. Walking in reverent fear of Yahweh, also brings His protection during trials. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>The way of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a stronghold for the upright, but ruin to the workers of injustice</em>.” (Prov. 10:29). The “way of the LORD, “gives strength, i.e. either courage and confidence, or support and protection from that destruction here following.” (Matthew Poole’s Commentary on Prov. 10:29).<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by taking refuge in Him, and He will be your shield</u>. Jesus is a shield to all who fear Him by avoiding the false assurances of worldly things and finding security in Him alone. “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (2 Sam. 22:31). “For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” (Ps. 1:6). “But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their strength in time of trouble.” (Ps. 37:39).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus by voiding evil brings assurance and confidence</u>. Only those who fear Jesus by clinging to Him in faith have the assurance of salvation. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>The righteous will never be shaken, but the wicked will not live in the land</em>.” (Prov. 10:30). “The righteous will never be cast away from the things that the Lord has made, but is at liberty, because he has an inheritance in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 10:30).<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ offer of eternal life is limited to those with faith</u>. Jesus offers an eternal inheritance to all who have faith in Him. “Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”’ (Matt. 25:34). But those who are not made righteous through faith in His atoning sacrifice have no part in this inheritance. “The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.” (Ps. 37:29). “For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be eliminated.’ (Ps. 37:22; Matt. 25:46; Ro. 6:23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by voiding evil and speaking His Word of life</u>. Solomon stated that you will know a person who fears Yahweh by the fruit of what comes out of his or her mouth. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, but the perverted tongue will be cut out</em>. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong><em>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverted</em>.” (Prov. 10:31-32). “[A]s a tree produces fruit, and the fields yield their increase … A good man's lips are conversant with what is acceptable to God and man. Such a person considers what will please God and edify his neighbor, and speaks in conformity therewith.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 10:31-32).<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> “The abuse of God’s gift of speech will lead ultimately to its forfeiture.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 10:31).<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by speaking His blessings of the Good News and avoiding words of the flesh</u>. Believers can either fear Jesus by speaking what is good or embracing what is evil by spreading darkness. “You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, express any good things? For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart. The good person brings out of his good treasure good things; and the evil person brings out of his evil treasure evil things.” (Matt. 12:34-35; Jam. 3:10-11). Instead of spreading lies, slander, and gossip, Jesus wants you to spread His Good News (Matt. 28:18-20).</p></li>
