<h1 id="proverbs-15-lessons-regarding-the-signs-of-a-disciple-of-jesus"><strong>Proverbs 15: Lessons Regarding the Signs of a Disciple of Jesus</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Jesus says that you will know a person by their fruits (Matt. 7:16-20). Through Solomon’s descriptions of God-fearing believers, the Bible reveals several signs of a disciple of Jesus. These include: (1) holy speech, (2) pursuing His righteousness, (3) being Spirit-minded, (4) seeking His wisdom, (5) seeking to remain on His path, (6) prayer, and (7) humility.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one through four, Solomon describes how God-fearing believers pursue holy speech. Jesus’ disciples should also speak only holy words. <u>Second</u>, in verses five through 12, Solomon provides several examples of how a God-fearing person pursues His righteousness. Jesus’ disciples should also pursue His righteousness. <u>Third</u>, in verses 13 through 19, Solomon provides several examples of how God-fearing believers set their thoughts on holy things. Jesus’ disciples are also Spirit-minded and avoid living according to their flesh. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 20 through 23, Solomon provides examples of how a God-fearing person is constantly seeking Yahweh’s wisdom. Jesus’ disciples should also constantly seek out His wisdom. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 24 through 28, Solomon provides examples of how God-fearing believers seek to remain on His path leading to life. Jesus’ disciples should also seek to remain on His narrow path. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 29 through 30, Solomon provides examples of how a God-fearing believer prays and speaks words of life. Jesus’ disciples should also pray and offer words of life in Him. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 31 through 33, Solomon describes how a God-fearing believer has the humility to accept godly correction. Jesus’ disciples should also have the humility to accept Spirit-led correction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God-honoring speech seeks to bring calm and reconciliation to a conflict</u>. Jesus’ disciples should seek to bring calm to a tense situation with gentle words. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger</em>.” (Prov. 15:1). “This verse teaches us an important lesson about the impact of our words on others. We are reminded that how we respond in conversations can shape the atmosphere around us. When we choose to respond with kindness and gentleness, we create a positive environment that encourages understanding and peace. This is critical in our families, friendships, and community interactions.” (Jamie Wilson, ExplainingtheBible.com on Prov. 15:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples guard their mouths from causing anger and instead seek reconciliation</u>. Because our hearts are sinful, Solomon repeatedly warned that an unguarded mouth can bring ruin to a person’s relationships. “One who guards his mouth protects his life; one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.” (Prov. 13:3; 17:27-28; 21:23). Thus, you should control your anger before you speak. “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, for anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9; Jam. 1:19, 26). Jesus will bless those who instead use their tongues to bring peace and reconciliation to a conflict. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.” (Matt. 5:9; Jam. 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:18).</p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples should guard their tongues to avoid creating unnecessary conflicts<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God-honoring speech seeks to spread His wisdom to the lost</u>. A disciple of Jesus should also seek to share His wisdom. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>The tongue of the wise makes knowledge pleasant, but the mouth of fools spouts foolishness.”</em> (Prov. 15:2). “Thus every good man, out of the good treasure of knowledge in his heart, brings forth his good things seasonably, to the use of edifying; in like manner, ministers of the word, scribes well instructed in the things of God, bring forth both new and old, to the profit of those to whom they minister; so Christ, as man and Mediator, had the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season to weary souls;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 15:2).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples seek to share His wisdom and offer only holy words</u>. Solomon stated that Yahweh’s wisdom brings healing. “There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.” (Prov. 12:18). When Moses confronted Pharaoh, God directed his speech (Ex. 4:12, 4:15; 6:29). If you let the Holy Spirit direct your speech, He will speak the right words through you (Matt. 10:20). Your speech should share Jesus’ Good News of salvation (Matt. 28:16-20; Ro. 10:15). To reflect the light of Jesus, your speech should also be holy (Eph. 4:29; Col. 4:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of God includes restraining evil speech to offer only holy words</u>. Within the context of his proverbs about speech, Solomon warned that God sees a person’s every action, both good and bad. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are in every place, watching the evil and the good</em>.” (Prov. 15:3). “Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God’s eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 15:3).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>No evil or good thing escapes Jesus’ omnipotence and omnipresence<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples know that He will one day bring to light every good or bad situation</u>. Solomon and other prophets warned that God will ultimately reward every good thing that a person says or does and discipline or judge every evil word or deed. “For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.” (Ecc. 12:14). “Can a person hide himself in hiding places so that I do not see him?” declares the LORD. ‘Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 23:24; Job 34:21-22; Ps. 139:7). These warnings are repeated in the New Testament. “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37; Matt. 10:26; Heb. 4:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God-honoring speech brings life to the lost</u>. Jesus’ disciples offer life-giving words through Him and avoid words that crush a person’s hope. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit</em>.” (Prov. 15:4). “<strong>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life</strong>: Good words are like a <strong>tree</strong> that continually brings <strong>life</strong> from its shade and fruit. Our words have the power to do far more good than we often think. <strong>Perverseness in it breaks the spirit</strong>: If someone’s tongue is perverse (twisted, crooked, corrupt) instead of <strong>wholesome</strong>, their words will break <strong>the spirit</strong> of others. Our words have the power to do far more harm than we often think.” (David Guzik on Prov. 15:4).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples seek to share the Word of life</u>. Solomon warned that a person’s words can speak life and death (Prov. 18:21). Yahweh’s wisdom should be spoken to bring healing to the lost (Prov. 12:18; 16:24). The New Testament reveals that you can speak life into another person by directing that person to find eternal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ (Jo. 3:16; 6:40; Acts 4:12; 1 Jo. 5:11-12; Is. 53:5-6). People with “soothing tongues” also show the fruit of the Spirit in their speech (Gal. 5:22-23).</p></li>

<h2 id="righteousness-jesus-disciples-pursue-his-righteousness.-prov.-155-12."><strong>2. <u>Righteousness: Jesus’ Disciples Pursue His Righteousness</u>. Prov. 15:5-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous submit to Spirit-led discipline</u>. Those seeking to walk in Jesus’ wisdom and grow in His righteousness submit to godly discipline. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A fool rejects his father’s discipline, but he who complies with rebuke is sensible</em>.” (Prov. 15:5). “Humility is essential in our quest for wisdom. Recognizing that we do not know everything and that there is room for improvement is key. Acknowledging our limitations invites others to help us grow. This scripture reminds us that seeking help and being open to constructive criticism fosters personal development.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 15:5).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous grow in Jesus’ wisdom when they submit to Spirit-led discipline</u>. In several proverbs, Solomon stressed how finding true wisdom requires the humility to submit to godly discipline. “One who loves discipline loves knowledge, but one who hates rebuke is stupid.” (Prov. 12:1). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:8; 13:18; 15:31-32; 19:20). Those who submit to godly discipline grow in Jesus’ righteousness (Heb. 12:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous in Jesus find great treasures in Him</u>. Although worldly wealth can quickly pass away, Jesus offers abundant spiritual riches to those who are made righteous through their faith in Him. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Great wealth is in the house of the righteous, but trouble is in the income of the wicked</em>.” (Prov. 15:6). “In a spiritual sense, the soul of the righteous is filled with graces and adorned with good works.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 15:6).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous store up their treasures in heaven</u>. The Bible repeatedly warns against hoarding worldly wealth, which has no power to save you. “Riches do not benefit on the day of wrath, but righteousness rescues from death.” (Prov. 11:4). “Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the LORD’S anger; and all the earth will be devoured by the fire of His jealousy, for He will make a complete end, Indeed a horrifying one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.” (Zeph. 1:18). Disciples of Jesus instead store up their treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:19-20;1 Tim. 6:17-19).</p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples should find their riches through their relationship with Him<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous seek to spread true knowledge and wisdom through Jesus</u>. Disciples of Jesus wisely use their influence to share the truth and hope that Jesus offers with the lost. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The lips of the wise spread knowledge, but the hearts of fools are not so</em>.” (Prov. 15:7). “The Bible tells us that “the lips of the wise spread knowledge.” What we have inside of us can be released out of us and into the lives of others. Paul the Apostle understood this truth and said that God would use him and his fellow workers in the gospel to spread the knowledge of Him to others – wherever they went:” (Biblicallywise.com, Prov. 15:7).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples share the “fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place”</u>. David, a psalmist from the sons of Korah, and Solomon all stressed that persons made righteous through their faith use their words to share Yahweh’s wisdom. “The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.” (Ps. 37:30). “My mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will be understanding.” (Ps. 49:3). “The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, but the perverted tongue will be cut out.” (Prov. 10:31). Paul built upon these words to stress that those who are made righteous through faith in Jesus share the wonders of knowing Him everywhere they go. “But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.” (2 Cor. 2:14; Ro. 10:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous offer sacrifice and prayer with the right heart</u>. Jesus’ disciples approach Him with a heart of loving gratitude in both their works and prayers. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but the prayer of the upright is His delight</em>.” (Prov. 15:8). “This verse continues the topic of the ‘righteous’ (cf. vv. 8b, 9b) and the ‘wicked’ (vv. 8a, 9a) … <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>prayer</em> is a broken stereotyped representing worship’s two essentials: slaying a costly animal and offering an accompanying petition or intercession (cf., Deut. 26:1-15; 1 Kgs. 8:22-63; 2 Chr. 29:27-28; Ps. 4:6; Prov. 15:29; 21:3. 13, 27, passim). The point is not that <em>I AM</em> prefers prayer over sacrifice but that the wicked hope to manipulate God by ritual magic instead of obtaining his mercy by confessing and repenting (28:13). They offer everything except what <em>I AM</em> asked for: their heart. By contrast, the upright rightly employ prayer and sacrifice in their pursuit of righteousness.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 15:8).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus delights in the prayers of the righteous<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples make themselves living sacrifices and serve out of loving devotion</u>. Long before Jesus came, He condemned through Isaiah the ritualistic sacrifices without a humble and contrite heart. ‘“What are your many sacrifices to Me?’ Says the LORD. ‘I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened cattle; and I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.’ (Is. 1:11; Hos. 6:6; Ps. 51:16-17). Jesus’ disciples make themselves living sacrifices (Ro. 12:1). The sacrifices they offer are praise, worship, service, holiness, and loving devotion (Heb. 13:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous are made so through Jesus and follow after His example</u>. Jesus’ disciples know that they are only made righteous through faith in His atoning sacrifice. They respond by following His righteous example. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The way of the wicked is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but He loves the one who pursues righteousness</em>.” (Prov. 15:9). “We have seen what God thinks of the <em>sacrifice</em> of the wicked and of the <em>thoughts</em> of the wicked; now we see that the way of the wicked is also an abomination to the Lord. But He loves the person who follows after righteousness. Remember that it is Christ who has been made unto us righteousness (see 1 Cor. 1:30).” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 15:9).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples show their love for Him by seeking to stay holy for His use</u>. God wanted His people to remain holy and separate from the unclean nations around them (Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7).  To keep His people holy and from turning their hearts away from Him, believers are not allowed to adopt the sexual practices of non-believers (Lev. 18:1-3).  When the Jews did these things, they “defiled” themselves (Lev. 18:24).  As our example, David’s love for God also included a vow to keep himself holy for God’s use by seeking to “know no evil”: “A perverse heart shall leave me; I will know no evil.” (Ps. 101:4). David would also fail in this vow. But he would then repent and return to God when he failed to be holy. A disciple of Jesus also seeks to be holy for His use.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous welcome Spirit-led correction to stay on Jesus’ narrow path</u>. Jesus’ disciples fear straying from Him. Thus, they welcome godly discipline that keeps them on His narrow, righteous path. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>There is severe punishment for one who abandons the way; one who hates a rebuke will die</em>.” (Prov. 15:10). “The backslider does not like to be reminded about sin and will not stand for any type of correction. There are no surer steps to ruin that to forget God and not listen to reproof; it will certainly bring down judgment on the hardhearted person.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 15:10).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples show their love for Him by humbly submitting to correction</u>. God blessed the Jews out of grace, even though they were a stiff-necked people (Dt. 9:6). Jesus’ disciples know that pride can also cause them to resist correction, which in turn leads to suffering (Prov. 29:1; Is. 48:4; Ro. 2:5). Thus, Jesus’ disciples will humble themselves to receive His loving correction (Heb. 12:6; Prov. 13:18; 10:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of God includes knowing that nothing in their hearts is hidden from Him</u>. Jesus’ disciples know that God can see everything in even the lowest pits of hell. Thus, He knows what people try to hide in their sinful hearts. “<strong><sup>11</sup></strong> <em>Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, how much more the hearts of mankind!</em>” (Prov. 15:11). “<strong>Hell and destruction.—</strong> ‘Hell’ is here the general name for the unseen world (<em>Hades</em>) beyond the grave, so called, according to one derivation, from its always ‘asking’ for more victims, and never being satisfied. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm"><u>Proverbs 27:20</u></a>.) ‘Destruction’ (<em>Abaddon</em>) is the lowest hell, corresponding to the ‘abyss’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm"><u>Luke 8:31</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm"><u>Revelation 9:1</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm"><u>Revelation 9:11</u></a>; the abode of evil spirits and the lost. (For the thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm"><u>Job 26:6</u></a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm"><u>Psalm 139:8</u></a>.)” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 15:11).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples know that they cannot conceal any hidden sins from Him</u>. Solomon likely found inspiration for Proverbs 15:11 from Job. “Sheol is naked before Him, and Abaddon has no covering.” (Job 26:6). David also observed that God would see him, even if he went to Sheol. “If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.” (Ps. 139:8). Those who fear God know He searches the heart and knows all things (Jer. 17:10). No sin can be hidden from Him (Heb. 4:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who walk in Jesus’ righteousness willingly submit to godly correction</u>. Those who reject Spirit-led correction are most likely not on a path to join those made righteous through faith in Jesus. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>A scoffer does not love one who rebukes him; he will not go to the wise</em>.” (Prov. 15:12). “The relevance of Proverbs 15:12 extends to contemporary society, where many individuals grapple with receiving criticism or direction, often opting to chart their own course. This verse underscores the vital role of humility and the willingness to seek and embrace wisdom from others. In a culture that often exalts self-reliance and individualism, this biblical passage advocates for a countercultural stance of pursuing communal insight and correction.” (Godbless.ing on Prov. 15:12).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Spirit-led correction frequently create pain in their own lives</u>. God repeatedly warned that He will judge those who scoff at His wisdom. “The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous. Though He scoffs at the scoffers, yet He gives grace to the needy.” (Prov. 3:33-34). ‘“Proud,’ ‘Arrogant,’ ‘Scoffer,’ are his names, one who acts with insolent pride.” (Prov. 21:24). “One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself. Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you.” (Prov. 9:7-8; 13:1; 14:6).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spirit-minded-jesus-disciples-are-spirit-minded.-prov.-1513-19."><strong>3. <u>Spirit-Minded: Jesus’ Disciples are Spirit-Minded</u>. Prov. 15:13-19.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples find joy in the Spirit during difficult times</u>. While the joy of a worldly person is conditional to their circumstances, a believer who has his or her heart set on Jesus and the Holy Spirit finds true joy during even a difficult trial. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>A joyful heart makes a cheerful face, but when the heart is sad, the spirit is broken</em>.” (Prov. 15:13). “Solomon observes that inner joy, or sadness, is reflected in a person’s face. As with all ‘proverbs,’ this is a general statement of common sense, not an absolute rule. Sad people can ‘put on a brave face’ and pretend all is well just as happy people can disguise their feelings. For the most part, however, our emotions are displayed in our physical bodies. Instead of living under the circumstances, faith enables a believer to live above their circumstances (Philippians 4:13). Instead of becoming a victim of the hardships of life, the believer can become a victor over them.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 15:13).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus and set your mind on the things of the Spirit when you are feeling sad</u>. Jesus promises to comfort the brokenhearted when they turn to Him and give Him their burdens. “The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” (Ps. 34:18; Matt. 5:4; 2 Cor. 1:3-5; Rev. 21:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples will set their minds to find deeper knowledge through Him</u>. A mind set of the Spirit includes seeking a deeper knowledge of Jesus. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 15:14). “A wise man seeks to gain more wisdom, growing in grace and in the knowledge of Christ. But a carnal mind rests contented, flattering itself.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 15:14).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your walk with Jesus should include a life-long search for deeper knowledge of Him</u>. Believers are encouraged to grow in their knowledge of God. “The mind of the discerning acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.” (Prov. 18:15). “Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight.” (Prov. 9:9; 1:5; 8:17). “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5; Matt. 7:7-8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples set their hearts on finding joy in the Spirit, not in worldly things</u>. While those who find joy in their circumstances will experience sorrow in bad times, those who find joy in the Spirit have a peace that cannot be taken away. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>All the days of the needy are bad, but a cheerful heart has a continual feast</em>.” (Prov. 15:15). “The phrase ‘days of the afflicted are evil’ emphasizes that prolonged affliction can lead to despair, and it serves as a reality check. Affliction affects our moods and perspective. It’s like carrying a heavy backpack that slows us down and makes it difficult to enjoy the journey. On the other hand, the term ‘merry heart’ underscores the importance of fostering a joyful spirit. A ‘merry heart’ is an attitude cultivated through conscious efforts, such as gratitude, contentment, and love. This encourages us to engage in activities that uplift our spirits, such as spending time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies, or practicing gratitude. Furthermore, the idea of a ‘continual feast’ signifies that joy is abundant and not based on external circumstances. We can experience a rich, fulfilling life filled with joy no matter what adversities we encounter. This reiterates that we have the power to create joy from the inside out. We are not victims of our circumstances; instead, we can rise above and celebrate life with a cheerful spirit.” (Christinanitypath.com on Prov. 15:15).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples should seek to find contentment in Him<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus to overcome your trials</u>. Jesus offers to deliver those who turn to Him in their trials (Ps. 34:19). “Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with little, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” (Phil. 4:11-13; 2 Cor. 4:16-18; Jo. 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples value their eternal security over wealth</u>. While worldly treasures can quickly disappear, Jesus’ disciples know that He offers eternal treasures. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>Better is a little with the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than great treasure, and turmoil with the treasure</em>.” (Prov. 15:16). “<strong>Better is a little with the fear of the LORD</strong>: Especially in our materialistic and consumer age, we constantly want <em>more,</em> and we fear living with <strong>little</strong>. Yet life is better with <strong>little</strong> if lived with reverence and honor to God (<strong>the fear of the LORD</strong>) … <strong>Than great treasure with trouble</strong>: To have <strong>great treasure</strong> and great <strong>trouble</strong> is not a good life. Because <strong>the fear of the LORD</strong> spares us from much <strong>trouble</strong>, it is better to have that than <strong>great treasure</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 15:16).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples find their treasure in Him and avoid covetousness<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your treasures in heaven and flee from covetousness</u>. Those who find contentment in money will find that their needs are never satisfied. “One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of labor and striving after wind.” (Ecc. 4:6; Lk. 12:15). “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.” (1 Tim. 6:9-11). If you seek first Jesus’ kingdom and His righteousness, He will provide (Matt. 6:31-33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples find greater joy in a simple life with love than wealth with turmoil</u>. The love of Jesus is greater than tumultuous wealth, even when you live a simple life. “<strong><sup>17<em> </em></sup></strong><em>Better is a portion of vegetables where there is love, than a fattened ox served with hatred</em>.” (Prov. 15:17). “A dish of vegetables would be the common meal, whereas flesh would be reserved for festive occasions. Where love presides, the simplest food is cheerfully received, and contentment and happiness abound (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm"><u>Proverbs 17:1</u></a>) … The fat beef implies a sumptuous and magnificent entertainment; but such a feast is little worth if accompanied with feelings of hatred, jealousy, and ill will. This and the preceding verse emphasize and explain ver. 15.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 15:17).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Find peace in Jesus’ love for you, and you will lack no good thing.</u> The Bible repeatedly stresses the importance of righteousness over wealth. “Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked.” (Ps. 37:16; 16:8). “But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either.” (1 Tim. 6:6-7). “Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have;…” (Hebr. 13:5). Jesus offers to help you find contentment in Him while living in a fallen world. “Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.” (Phil. 4:11; 2 Cor. 12:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples show themselves to be Spirit-minded by seeking peace</u>. While your flesh will always want to respond to an insult with an insult, you show yourself to be a disciple of Jesus when you try to bring peace and reconciliation to a difficult situation. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>A hot-tempered person stirs up strife, but the slow to anger calms a dispute</em>.” (Prov. 15:18). “A man of a wrathful disposition, of a furious spirit, of an angry temper; that is under the power and dominion of such a passion, and indulges it, and takes all opportunities to gratify it; he stirs up strife and contention where there was none, or where it was laid; as a man stirs up coals of fire and raises a flame; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-21.htm"><u>Proverbs 26:21</u></a>. He stirs up strife in families, sets one relation against another, and the house in an uproar; he stirs up contentions in neighborhoods, and sets one friend and neighbor against another, whence proceed quarrels and lawsuits: he stirs up strife in churches, breaks brotherly love, and causes animosities and divisions; he stirs up strife in kingdoms and states, whence come wars and fighting, confusion, and every evil work; but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife: a man of a quiet and peaceable disposition, possessed of the true grace of charity; who is not easily provoked, longsuffering, bears and endures all things; he allays the heat of anger; he quenches the coals of contention; he calms the storm and makes it quiet,” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 15:18).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Reflect Jesus’ light in a conflict with words of peace</u>. The Bible warns believers to control their anger. “One who is slow to anger has great understanding; but one who is quick-tempered exalts foolishness.” (Prov. 14:29; 17:27; Ecc. 7:9). When you fail to control your anger, you misrepresent Jesus’ love and light within you to the lost. “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20; Eph. 4:31-32). “So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so must you do also.” (Col. 3:12-13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples show themselves to be Spirit-minded by working hard for Him</u>. Because you reflect Jesus’ light to the lost, the example you set for others should never reflect a lazy work ethic. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>The way of the lazy one is like a hedge of thorns, but the path of the upright is a highway</em>.” (Prov. 15:19). “<strong>As a hedge of thorns.</strong>—Every difficulty in his path serves as an excuse for inaction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm"><u>Proverbs 22:13</u></a>); while the upright man, who does his duty as in the sight of God, goes ‘from strength to strength’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm"><u>Psalm 84:7</u></a>), along the path of life smoothed for him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm"><u>Isaiah 26:7</u></a>), performing the ‘just works’ appointed for him to do.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 15:19).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you face difficulties, turn to Jesus</u>. Lazy people will look for excuses or give up when they encounter difficulties. “The lazy one says, ‘There is a lion outside; I will be killed in the streets!”’ (Prov. 22:13; 26:13-14). Jesus will reward those who persevere with the talents that He has given them. He will also discipline those who fail to use His gifts to serve Him. “Now the one who had received the one talent also came up and said, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed. And I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you still have what is yours.’ But his master answered and said to him, ‘You worthless, lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed? Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest. Therefore: take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.”’ (Matt. 25:24-28).</p></li>

<h2 id="wisdom-jesus-disciples-constantly-seek-out-his-wisdom.-prov.-1520-23."><strong>4. <u>Wisdom: Jesus’ Disciples Constantly Seek Out His Wisdom</u>. Prov. 15:20-23.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples honor their parents by learning from their God-given wisdom</u>. Because the family was foundational to learning God’s Word and living a God-fearing life, Solomon declared that a wise child honors his or her parents as they honor God. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother</em>.” (Prov. 15:20). “Joy in Education (15:20-24). The introductory educational proverb in v. 20 resembles those of 10:1; 12:1; and 13:1. The key word <em>smh</em>, which as a verb is glossed by ‘makes glad’ (v. 20a) and as noun by ‘joy’ (v. 23a), frames this subunit on joy in successful child-rearing. The frame suggests a trajectory from the parents’ present joy in a teachable son (v. 20) to the son’s future joy in being able to answer wisely (v. 23)…The proverb suggests the essential role of parents in teaching the son their wisdom (see 1:7-8; cf. 23:22; 30:17).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 15:20).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples use family time to model and teach His wisdom to their children</u>. Because the family is God’s intended means for turning each new generation into faithful believers, the Fourth Commandment required that children honor their parents as they fulfilled their intended role. “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged on the land which the LORD your God gives you.” (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Because parents were meant to pass on Yahweh’s wisdom, Solomon also emphasized this in several proverbs. “The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.” (Prov. 10:1; 17:25; 19:13; 28:7). This principle is so important that it is also repeated in the New Testament. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),” (Eph. 6:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples constantly seek His wisdom to stay on His path</u>. Disciples know that that they cannot stay on the right path based upon their own wisdom. Thus, they recognize that they must constantly turn to Jesus for wisdom. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>Foolishness is joy to one who lacks sense, but a person of understanding walks straight</em>.” (Prov. 15:21). “A fool receives great delight in iniquity and in his own way. A fool walks by no rule, acts with no sincerity of faithfulness; the upright man, on the other hand, does all that he can to conform his life to the will of the Lord.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 15:21).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus for wisdom and do not lean on your own understanding</u>. If you think you have all the answers, you will inevitably stray from His path. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.” (Prov. 3:5-6; 10:23; 13:16; 14:16). “A wise person’s heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish person’s heart directs him toward the left. Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool.” (Ecc. 10:2-3). Believers must therefore be careful in their walk. “So then, be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.” (Eph. 5:15-17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples also find wisdom through Spirit-led counselors</u>. In addition to regular prayer and studying the Word, Jesus’ disciples must also seek out His wisdom through godly counselors. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with many counselors they succeed</em>.” (Prov. 15:22). “God gives us several ‘tools’ we can use to help us make wise decisions. The Bible, of course. Prayer. Wisdom itself. He wants us to use our God-given mind and sensibility. Experiences, both good and bad. And this one here, good godly input from trusted “advisors.” Psalm 1 also encourages us to walk in the counsel of the godly. Who do you have in your life that you can trust for good and godly input? Pre-wire your life for upcoming tough decision-making by surrounding yourself with wise, good, and godly folks. They can be a blessing to you and those impacted by your decisions.” (Bethany Christian Assembly on Prov. 15:22).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples submit to Spirit-led counsel<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples find a treasure of His wisdom through the experiences of godly people</u>. Jesus wants all believers to be in a community of believers. Within a church community, believers are called upon to seek out and listen to Spirit-led counsel. “Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is victory.” (Prov. 11:14). “Wisdom is with the aged, and with long life comes understanding.” (Job 12:12; Prov. 13:20). Rehoboam received godly counsel to address Israel’s discontent following Solomon’s death. But Israel later fell into civil war and divided after he ignored the advice and instead sought out less experienced advisors who agreed with his views (1 Kgs. 12:8). In contrast, Moses acted wisely when he listened to Jethro’s counsel for appointing God-fearing leaders to hear and resolve Israel’s conflicts (Ex. 18:13-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples find wisdom and joy in Spirit-led answers from their counselors</u>. If you are in a regular church community with godly counselors, you allow the Holy Spirit the opportunity to give you timely answers to your problems. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>A person has joy in an apt answer, and how delightful is a timely word!</em>” (Prov. 15:23). “The idea of the preceding verse concerning counsel is maintained. A counsellor gives wise and skillful advice, or makes a timely speech; and, knowing how much harm is done by rash or evil words, he naturally rejoices that he has been able to be useful, and has avoided the errors which the tongue is liable to incur.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 15:23).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Surround yourself with godly believers to find encouragement</u>. Jesus’ disciples sustain and uplift each other. “The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, so that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.” (Is. 50:4). “Like apples of gold in settings of silver, is a word spoken at the proper time.” (Prov. 25:11). “Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.” (Prov. 16:24). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6; Eph. 4:29).</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-path-jesus-disciples-seek-to-remain-on-his-path.-prov.-1524-28."><strong>5. <u>Jesus’ Path: Jesus’ Disciples Seek to Remain on His Path</u>. Prov. 15:24-28.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples know that He offers the only path to eternal life</u>. While there are many paths leading to eternal darkness, a disciple of Jesus seeks out His narrow path to eternal life. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>The path of life leads upward for the wise, so that he may keep away from Sheol below</em>.” (Prov. 15:24). “The way which a wise man takes to preserve and obtain spiritual and eternal life, is to place his heart, treasure, and conversation in things above; and to manage all his affairs in this world with due respect and subserviency to the happiness of another world;” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 15:24).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the way, the truth, and the light</u>. Jesus is clear that there is no other path to eternal life besides through faith in Him. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.” (Jo. 10:9). “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples recognize that His narrow path requires humility</u>. Those who believe that they are on Jesus’ narrow path deceive themselves if they are prideful or self-reliant. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will tear down the house of the proud, but He will set the boundary of the widow</em>.” (Prov. 15:25). “The widow - Here, as elsewhere <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm"><u>Deuteronomy 10:18</u></a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm"><u>Psalm 68:5</u></a>, the widow, as the most extreme type of desolation, stands as the representative of a class safer in their poverty under the protection of the Lord, than the proud in the haughtiness of their strength.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 15:25).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples recognize that pride leads to a person’s downfall</u>. The widows in Old Testament times needed others to support them. If you do not see yourself as dependent upon Jesus like an Old Testament widow, you are filled with pride and have strayed from Jesus’ narrow path. “When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom.” (Prov. 11:2; 16:18; 18:12). “For the LORD is exalted, yet He looks after the lowly, but He knows the haughty from afar.” (Ps. 138:6). He will exalt those who humble themselves. “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ … Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:6, 10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples recognize that His narrow path includes no room for evil</u>. If you make secret plans to obtain unholy things, you have strayed from Jesus’ path. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>Evil plans are an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but pleasant words are pure</em>.” (Prov. 15:26). “This verse highlights that the intent behind actions matters significantly. While a religious ritual or offering may appear sincere, if it springs from wicked intentions, it is considered worthless to the Lord. This principle draws attention to the depth of divine evaluation, where motives are scrutinized alongside actions. Such insights challenge the typical human tendency to judge merely by appearances … Ultimately, this proverb encourages the believer to reflect on their motives and the purity of their hearts, aligning their inner thoughts with their outward expressions of faith.” (Thebiblesays.com on Prov. 15:26).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples recognize He searches our minds and hearts to test our motives</u>. God-fearing persons know that they cannot entertain evil thoughts without Him knowing about it. “All the ways of a person are clean in his own sight, but the LORD examines the motives.” (Prov. 16:2). “Every person’s way is right in his own eyes, but the LORD examines the hearts.” (Prov. 21:2). “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10; (Matt. 15:7-8; Is. 29:13; Lk. 16:15). “So you too, outwardly appear righteous to people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” (Matt. 23:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ narrow path has no room for the unrighteous pursuit of wealth</u>. Those who pursue unholy means to obtain wealth have strayed from Jesus’ narrow path. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live</em>.” (Prov. 15:27). “The proverb condemns lustful desire to be rich, which leads to compromising godliness and wisdom. The gifts here are bribes, which are given to pay a man to compromise the law or financial wisdom (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2029.4;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 29:4</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Exod%2023.8;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Ex 23:8</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Deut%2016.19;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Deut 16:19</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Isa%2033.15;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Is 33:15</u></a>). A virtuous man will hate such gifts, for he will not sell his integrity or the approval of God for any price. There are many temptations associated with desire for financial success, and they often bring pain and trouble to a man’s family.” (LetGodbetrue.com on Prov. 15:27).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Jesus’ path to pursue covetousness will never be satisfied</u>. Bribes are just one form of covetousness. The love of money is an evil that does not bring long-term contentment. “One who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor one who loves abundance with its income. This too is futility.” (Ecc. 5:10). “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” (1 Tim. 6:9-10). “But He said to them, ‘Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one is affluent does his life consist of his possessions.”’ (Lk. 12:15; Matt. 6:24; Heb. 13:5).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Spirit-minded believers pray and contemplate before giving important answers</u>. Because the flesh can motivate a person to say evil things, Jesus’ disciples pray and reflect before speaking. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things</em>.” (Prov. 15:28). “The good man deliberates before he speaks, takes time to consider his answer, lest he should say anything false, or inexpedient, or injurious to his neighbor.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 15:28).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Spirit-minded believers guard their hearts to avoid evil speech</u>. Those who fail to guard their hearts and pray before speaking are more likely to say unholy things. “Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.” (Prov. 4:23). “You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, express any good things? For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart. The good person brings out of his good treasure good things; and the evil person brings out of his evil treasure evil things. But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment.” (Matt. 12:34-36; Col. 3:8; Ps. 51:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples repent of sin so that their prayers are not hindered</u>. While the wicked will not have their prayers answered, Jesus hears the prayers of those who are made righteous through faith in Him. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous</em>.” (Prov. 15:29). “When we engage in wickedness or choose to turn away from God, we create a wall between ourselves and the grace that God extends to the just. In contrast, the verse reveals that God hears the prayers of the righteous. Who are the righteous? They are those who strive to live in alignment with God’s will. It doesn’t mean being perfect, but it refers to having a heart that seeks God and desires to follow His ways. The encouragement here is that our prayers reach the ears of God when our heart aligns itself with Him. It gives us hope and assurance that as we earnestly seek God, our prayers are not in vain.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 15:29).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples repent of their sins to avoid having their prayers hindered<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Unrepentant sin can hinder your prayers</u>. In Old Testament times, God warned that He would not hear the prayers of those who embrace evil. “One who turns his ear away from listening to the Law, even his prayer is an abomination.” (Prov. 28:9). “The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are toward their cry for help. The face of the LORD is against evildoers, to eliminate the memory of them from the earth.” (Ps. 34:15-16). “If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord will not hear;” (Ps. 66:18; Is. 1:15). “But your wrongdoings have caused a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.” (Is. 59:2). “We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if someone is God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him.” (Jo. 9:31). For a believer made righteous through faith in Jesus, unrepentant sin can still “hinder” your prayers (1 Pet. 3:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples pray and speak the Good News of salvation</u>. In addition to prayer, Jesus’ disciples bring hope to the lost by sharing His Good News. “<strong><sup>30</sup></strong> <em>Bright eyes gladden the heart; good news refreshes the bones</em>.” (Prov. 15:30). “When a person greets others with a big smile, they feel uplifted and joyful. Paul understood how joy strengthens Christian bonds. He urged the Philippians to rejoice in the Lord (Philippians 4:4) …Good news encourages those who receive it, and in turn the encouragement promotes physical well-being. Although Christians are not immune from disease, aches, and pains, the lifestyle which naturally comes from following God’s will gives a better chance at health than avoidable sickness or injury. Much of this is due to avoiding the natural penalties of sinful living, including the effects of chemical abuse and risky behavior. The good news of the gospel and the good news of the promises in the Bible lift a believer’s spirits and contribute to good physical health.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 15:30).<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless His disciples who pray and share His Good News</u>. Those who pray and share Jesus’ Good News are a delight in His eyes. “How delightful on the mountains are the feet of one who brings good news, who announces peace and brings good news of happiness, who announces salvation, and says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”’ (Is. 52:7; Ro. 10:15). “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD anointed me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners; to proclaim the favorable year of the LORD and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn,” (Is. 61:1-2; Lk. 4:18-19). “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16).</p></li>

<h2 id="humility-jesus-disciples-accept-correction-in-humility.-prov.-1531-33."><strong>7. <u>Humility: Jesus’ Disciples Accept Correction in Humility</u>. Prov. 15:31-33.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples are humble to receive His correction</u>. Because believers are sinful by nature, Jesus’ disciples show the fruit of their walk through the humility to accept correction. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>One whose ear listens to a life-giving rebuke will stay among the wise</em>.” (Prov. 15:31). “A disciple with such an ear <em>dwells among the wise</em> – that is, lives with them, continuously ready to hear correction. The hearing ear and seeing eye are God’s handiwork (20:12).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 15:31).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ disciples submit to Spirit-led discipline</u>. Believers grow in wisdom by submitting to discipline. “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and rebukes for discipline are the way of life” (Prov. 6:23; 9:8; 12:1; 19:20). Those who submit to and grow from godly discipline grow in Jesus’ righteousness. “For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.” (Heb. 12:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers only harm themselves when they reject discipline</u>. Those who accept discipline grow in their walk with Jesus. “<strong><sup>32 </sup></strong><em>One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding</em>.” (Prov. 15:32). “<strong>He who disdains instruction despises his own soul</strong>: To refuse wisdom and the <strong>instruction</strong> that comes from wisdom is to hate one’s <strong>own soul</strong>. Those who reject wisdom hurt many people, but most of all themselves. <strong>He who heeds rebuke gets understanding</strong>. To hear and heed <strong>rebuke</strong> is to get and grow in wisdom (<strong>understanding</strong>). Receiving <strong>rebuke</strong> is rarely pleasant, but it is worth it for the wisdom it brings.” (David Guzik on Prov. 15:32).<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Pride causes believers to reject the wisdom of correction</u>. Those who reject discipline only bring harm to themselves. “A fool rejects his father’s discipline, but he who complies with rebuke is sensible.” (Prov. 15:5; 10:17; 13:18; 29:1). “But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:26-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of God brings humility and wisdom</u>. Jesus will honor those who fear Him through humility. “<strong><sup>33 </sup></strong><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the instruction for wisdom, and before honor comes humility</em>.” (Prov. 15:33). “The fear of the Lord will dispose us to search the Scriptures with reverence; and it will cause us to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit. While we humbly place all our dependence on the grace of God, we are exalted in the righteousness of Christ.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 15:33).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ disciples will be honored for their reverent fear, which includes hating evil<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</u>. Solomon concludes Proverbs 15 by restating the theme of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Ecc. 12:13). This wisdom is repeated in the Psalms and in Job. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all those who follow His commandments have a good understanding; His praise endures forever.” (Ps. 111:10). “And to mankind He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding.”’ (Job 28:28). A disciple of Jesus follows this by fearing Him. The fear of the Lord is defined as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:13). This includes all forms of pride.</p></li>
