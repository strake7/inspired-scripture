<h1 id="proverbs-12-seven-additional-signs-of-our-righteousness-in-christ"><strong>Proverbs 12: Seven Additional Signs of Our Righteousness in Christ</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 12 continues from Proverbs 11 the contrast between the “righteous” and the “wicked”. It is only through faith in Jesus that a believer is made “righteous.” (Ro. 3:22; Gal. 2:16). But believers should then seek to be “sanctified” by drawing closer to Him. This includes being an “imitator” of Jesus’ example (Matt. 5:48; Eph. 5:1). In Proverbs 12, Jesus reveals several further signs of a righteous believer. These include: (1) submission, (2) purity, (3) humility, (4) being Spirit-led, (5) loving truth, (6) diligence, and (7) walking in Jesus’ path.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon advised that those who submit to godly discipline grow in wisdom and God’s favor. Hebrews reveals that those who submit to Spirit-led discipline produce “the peaceful fruit of righteousness.” (Heb. 12:11). <u>Second</u>, through several examples, Solomon revealed that the righteous seek to remain pure in their thoughts and words. Those who are made righteous through Jesus should also seek to keep their thoughts and words pure for Him. <u>Third</u>, through different examples, Solomon illustrated that the righteous humbly serve God with the wisdom they receive. Those who are made righteous through Jesus should also be His humble servants. <u>Fourth</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon contrasts the righteous from the wicked based upon whether they pursue “worthless” worldly wealth and evil speech or whether they find fulfillment in the things of God. Jesus later revealed that the righteous are Spirit-led in all their actions, including work and speech. <u>Fifth</u>, in several proverbs, Solomon stated that the righteous speak the truth. Those who are made righteous through Jesus speak the truth out of love. <u>Sixth</u>, in other proverbs, Solomon revealed that the righteous work diligently. Those who are made righteous through faith in Jesus should diligently work to fulfill His will out of gratitude. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon concludes by stating that “<em>in</em> <em>the way of righteousness there is life,</em>” (Prov. 12:28). Those who are righteous through Jesus have the assurance of eternal life. They show their righteousness by walking in Jesus’ narrow path and sharing their hope to the lost.</p>

Prov. 12:1-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous submit to Spirit-led discipline</u>. Most who accept godly discipline become wise and righteous. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>One who loves discipline loves knowledge,</em> <em>but one who hates rebuke is stupid</em>.” (Prov. 12:1). “The difference between man and brute lies chiefly in the capacity of the former for progress and improvement, and that capacity depends upon his willingness to submit to discipline and education.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 12:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous grow in Jesus’ wisdom when they submit to Spirit-led discipline</u>. Believers grow in wisdom by submitting to discipline. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). “Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you.” (Prov. 9:8). “Poverty and shame will come to one who neglects discipline, but one who complies with rebuke will be honored.” (Prov. 13:18). “One whose ear listens to a life-giving rebuke will stay among the wise. One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding.” (Prov. 15:31-32). “Listen to advice and accept discipline, so that you may be wise the rest of your days.” (Prov. 19:20). Those who submit to and grow from godly discipline grow in Jesus’ righteousness. “For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.” (Heb. 12:11).</p></li>

<p>The righteous grow in wisdom and knowledge by submitting to godly correction<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who accept godly discipline will be blessed</u>. In addition to growing in wisdom, those who submit to godly discipline will grow in God’s favor. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>A good person will obtain favor from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but He will condemn a person who devises evil</em>.” (Prov. 12:2). Proverbs 12:2-3 are connected to the prior proverb on the wisdom of submitting to discipline. “The first proverb deals with wisdom or goodness in its inner source; namely, a docile disposition. The two next deal with its consequences. It secures God’s favor, while its opposite is condemned; and then, as a consequence of this, the good man is established and the wicked swept away.” (Alexander MacLaren on Prov. 12:2).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you submit to Spirit-led discipline, God blesses you, your house, and your path</u>. Through Solomon, God promised to bless the home of the righteous. “The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous.” (Prov. 3:33). Through David, God promised to surround the righteous with His shield. “For You bless the righteous person, LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12). Through Isaiah, God promised to bless the path of the righteous. “The way of the righteous is smooth; o Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.” (Is. 26:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who accept discipline also find a strong foundation during trials and tribulations</u>. While those who embrace wickedness will have little to protect them during a trial, those who grow in Jesus’ righteousness through discipline develop a firm foundation in Him. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>A person will not be established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous will not be moved</em>.” (Prov. 12:3). “Man is metaphorically compared to a tree, especially the olive. Wickedness gives him no firm hold for growth or life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>). The root of the righteous shall not be moved. The righteous are planted in a good soil, are ‘rooted and grounded in love’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>), and the root being thus well placed, the tree is safe, and brings forth much fruit.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 12:3).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous who grow in wisdom have an immovable rock during any trial</u>. If a person has the wisdom to act upon Jesus’ Word (including His loving discipline), he or she will have a firm foundation in Jesus during the trials of life. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:24-27).</p></li>

<h2 id="purity-the-righteous-seek-to-remain-pure-for-jesus.-prov.-124-7."><strong>2. <u>Purity: The Righteous Seek to Remain Pure for Jesus</u>. Prov. 12:4-7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous person strives to remain pure in both marriage and for Jesus</u>. In both the context of marriage and as the bride of Jesus, a righteous person seeks to remain pure. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>An excellent wife is the crown of her husband,</em> <em>but she who shames him is like rottenness in his bones</em>.” (Prov. 12:4). “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, .... One that is loving and chaste, constant and faithful, obsequious and submissive to him; that is diligent in the affairs of her house, takes care of her family, brings up her children, and keeps up a good order and decorum among her servants, is an honor and credit to her husband. Such is the true church of Christ, who is compared to a woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-1.htm"><u>Revelation 12:1</u></a>; to a woman of purity and chastity, whose members are virgins, not defiled with the corruptions, errors, and superstition of the apostate church; to a woman of fortitude and courage,” (John Gill Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 12:4).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be pure for both your spouse and for Jesus</u>. In the context of marriage, a pure spouse is of greater value than precious stones. “An excellent wife, who can find her? For her worth is far above jewels.” (Prov. 31:10). Spouses should submit to each other just as Jesus submitted for His Church (1 Pet. 3:1-9; Eph. 5:22-33). Believers are also the bride of Christ and should remain pure for Him (Rev. 19:7-9). He made you righteous at a terrible price (1 Cor. 6:20). Thus, you are called upon to make your life a living sacrifice for Him (Ro. 12:1). Jesus also wants you to be pure and holy for His use.  He wants you to be holy because He is holy (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-5; 19:2; 20:7).  Part of being pure and holy includes separating yourself from unclean things (Dt. 22:10; 2 Cor. 6:14). </p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous in Christ strive to keep their thoughts pure to keep their actions pure</u>. Because the desires of the heart are evil and ruinous when acted upon, the righteous turn to Jesus to keep their thoughts pure. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful</em>.” (Prov. 12:5). “The <strong>righteous</strong> man or woman is not only right in their actions, but even in their <strong>thoughts</strong>. They know something of what it means to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Romans+12.1-2&amp;t=NKJV">Romans 12:1-2</a>) … As for the <strong>wicked</strong>, it is more than their actions that are <strong>deceitful</strong>; their <strong>counsels</strong> (thinking, thoughts) are also full of deception and error.” (David Guzik on Prov. 12:5).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous renew their minds daily in Jesus because the desires of the heart are evil</u>. God tests the mind to show believers where the desires of their heart are evil. “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it? I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:9-10). Once God shows believers where their desires are evil, believers are called upon to repent and invite Jesus to renew their minds to focus on the things of the Spirit. “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Ro. 12:2; Eph. 4:23-24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus rescues the righteous by giving them the power to control their tongues from evil</u>. While the wicked speak words of the flesh and bring judgment upon themselves, the righteous are pure in their speech. Thus, they are spared from discipline. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>The words of the wicked wait in ambush for blood, but the mouth of the upright will rescue them</em>.” (Prov. 12:6). “<strong>Proverbs 12:6</strong> says that the words of the wicked lie in wait for blood. The sad reality is that some people are just waiting to tear others apart with their words. They watch and wait for someone to make a mistake or slip up. When it happens, they are ready to pounce and speak words of death and a curse over that person. The words of the upright deliver a person, however. We have the power and the ability to speak life into our lives, situations, and circumstances.” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 12:6).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous seek to keep their words pure to avoid being defiled</u>. Those who speak their evil thoughts defile themselves before Jesus. “It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles the person.” (Matt. 15:11; Mk. 7:15). In doing so, they face judgment. “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment.” (Matt. 12:36; Jam. 3:5-6). Thus, the righteous turn to Jesus to control what they say. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The families of the righteous in Jesus will survive His trials</u>. While the wicked will be judged, Jesus’ blessings upon the righteous will also protect their families during the trials of life. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand</em>.” (Prov. 12:7). “God’s blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 12:7).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The righteous have a foundation in Jesus that cannot be shaken<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be righteous in Jesus and lead your family to find protection in Him</u>. The righteous do not magically make their families righteous. Instead, because they are righteous, they counsel their families to find security and protection in Jesus.  “The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.” (Prov. 14:11). Such families have Jesus, the Rock, as their foundation during a trial (Matt. 7:24-27; Lk. 6:47-49).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="humility-the-righteous-act-as-jesus-humble-servants.-prov.-128-10."><strong>3. <u>Humility: The Righteous Act as Jesus’ Humble Servants</u>. Prov. 12:8-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous will be praised for sharing their God-given wisdom as His witness</u>. While those who are driven by pride and evil will eventually be rejected, those who humbly share their God-given wisdom to glorify Him will be exalted. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>A person will be praised according to his insight, but one of perverse mind will be despised</em>.” (Prov. 12:8). “Society values wise actions and decisions because they lead to better outcomes not only for ourselves but also for others. In a sense, wisdom breeds respect and admiration in others. It stands in stark opposition to the perverse heart, which can lead to destructive behaviors and choices. The Bible teaches us that when we think of the mind and heart, we should aim for righteousness.” (ChristianitypathProv. 12:8).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> But Proverbs 12:8 cannot be read in isolation from Proverbs 12:9’s message on humility. God does not give us wisdom so that we can be glorified and exalted amongst mankind. Instead, He gives us wisdom so that He can be glorified amongst mankind. “I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, nor My praise to idols.” (Is. 42:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will exalt the righteous who share their wisdom in humility to draw others to Him</u>. While speaking of the righteous, Solomon clarified that Yahweh’s wisdom is given to the humble. “When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom.” (Prov. 11:2; 18:12). Jesus wants you to share in humility the wisdom that He gives you so that God the Father may be glorified. “Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:16). Jesus will then exalt you in heaven. “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12). “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.” (Jam. 3:13). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you” (Jam. 4:10). Those who are wise in their own eyes or take credit for that which belongs to Jesus. “Take care that no one deceives himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: ‘He is the one who catches the wise by their craftiness.’” (1 Cor. 3:18-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous are content to live in humble modesty</u>. Out of vanity, the wicked seek to deceive others with false appearances of wealth. In contrast, the righteous are content to live in humble modesty with God’s provision. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Better is one who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, than one who honors himself and lacks bread</em>.” (Prov. 12:9). “The general saying of v.8 is now applied specifically. To live comfortably as a nobody is better than pretending to be rich while poor (cf. 15:17; 30:8-9) … Petty people unwisely spend their sparse resources to keep up vain appearances. Their slavery to human opinion dooms them to shame.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 12:9).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous value humility, modesty, and contentment over the pursuit of wealth</u>. It is better to live a righteous life of modesty than defile yourself through greed. “Better is a little with righteousness than great income with injustice.” (Prov. 16:8). “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than a person who is perverse in speech and is a fool.” (Prov. 19:1). “Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: did God not choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?” (Jam. 2:5). Righteous believers show their faith by placing their hopes in Jesus as opposed to the pursuit of worldly wealth. “And Jesus said to His disciples, ‘Truly I say to you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”’ (Matt. 19:23-24; Mk. 10:25; Lk. 18:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous act with humble compassion, even for animals</u>. The wicked have no concern for the defenseless and oppressed. In contrast, the righteous have compassion even for the lowly animals. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>A righteous person has regard for the life of his animal, but even the compassion of the wicked is cruel</em>.” (Prov. 12:10). “The verse emphasizes the value of goodness not just towards other people but also towards the creatures under our care. The second part of the verse contrasts the righteous with the wicked, stating that even the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. This suggests that people who engage in wrongdoing or who lack compassion may act kindly at times, but their actions are ultimately cruel. This serves as a warning against superficial kindness that lacks true compassion. A righteous person shows consistent care for all living things, while the wicked may only pretend to be gentle.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 12:10).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous are like shepherds, having humble compassion for God’s flock</u>. God’s law required His people to show compassion for all, including animals. “If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load, you shall not leave it helpless for its owner; you must arrange the load with him.” (Ex. 23:5; Dt. 22:4). Jesus revealed that the righteous should act as His shepherds by protecting His flock. A true shepherd humbly places the needs of the flock above his or her self-interest. “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock. He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.” (Jo. 10:11-13). David showed himself qualified to be God’s shepherd of Israel by placing his life at risk to protect his sheep from dangerous predators, like lions and bears (1 Sam. 17:34-36).</p></li>

<h2 id="spirit-led-the-righteous-are-spirit-led-in-work-and-speech.-prov.-1211-16"><strong>4. <u>Spirit-Led: The Righteous are Spirit-Led in Work and Speech</u>. Prov. 12:11-16</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous work hard for Jesus’ Kingdom</u>. Unlike the wicked who pursue and labor hard for “worthless things,” the righteous diligently work to fulfill Jesus’ will. Jesus in turn fully provides for them. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>One who works his land will have plenty of bread,</em> <em>but one who pursues worthless things lacks sense</em>.” (Prov. 12:11). Verse 11’s message on hard work must be read in the context of hard work that is focused on Jesus’ perfect will. Jesus does not want you laboring for your own glory. Instead, labor for His glory (Is. 42:8). “An old writer once wrote: ‘The proud person is Satan’s throne, and the idle man his pillow. He sitteth in the former, and sleepeth quietly on the later.’ The man therefore that follows vain persons, instead of honest labor, proves himself to be void of understanding and will reap the fruits of his folly.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 12:11).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous who labor hard for Jesus will lack no good thing</u>. In other proverbs, Solomon observes: “One who works his land will have plenty of food, but one who follows empty pursuits will have plenty of poverty.” (Prov. 28:19). “The plans of the diligent certainly lead to advantage, but everyone who is in a hurry certainly comes to poverty.” (Prov. 21:5). But these promises must be read in the full context of Scripture. Jesus provides for those who diligently labor for Him. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). Those who sow greatly for Jesus will also reap greatly from His blessings, even though His blessings may be spiritual. “Now I say this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows generously will also reap generously.” (2 Cor. 9:6).</p></li>

<p>The righteous who labor for Jesus are offered an abundant harvest<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous desire the fruit of the Spirit</u>. Unlike the wicked who may willingly cause others harm out of greed, the righteous seek and find fulfillment in the fruit of the Spirit. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>The wicked person desires the plunder of evil people, but the root of the righteous yields fruit</em>.” (Prov. 12:12). “There is perhaps an intended contrast between the restless and often fruitless activity of the hunter with his net, and the calm, steadfast fruit-bearing, as by a natural process, of the firmly-rooted tree. So St Paul contrasts the ‘works’ of the flesh with the ‘fruit’ of the spirit, and ‘the unfruitful works of darkness’ with ‘the fruit of the light’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm"><u>Galatians 5:19</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm"><u>Galatians 5:22</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-9.htm"><u>Ephesians 5:9-10</u></a>, R.V.).” (Thomas Thomason Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Prov. 12:12).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous are satisfied with the fruit of Jesus’ vine while the wicked become greedy</u>. Jesus is the true vine of life. “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.” (Jo. 15:5). The righteous who are rooted in Jesus will yield the fruit of the Spirit through their work and actions. “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.” (Gal. 5:22-23). For those who instead become filled with greed and covetousness, both Jesus and the apostles warned against the evils that flow from such desires. “But He [Jesus] said to them, ‘Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one is affluent does his life consist of his possessions.”’ (Lk. 12:15), “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.” (1 Tim. 6:9-11). Greed cannot be satisfied (Ecc. 5:10). Believers should instead focus on the enduring riches of Jesus over the fleeting riches of the world. “Do not weary yourself to gain wealth; stop dwelling on it. When you set your eyes on it, it is gone. For wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that flies toward the heavens.” (Prov. 23:4-5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Righteous people obey the Spirit and avoid speech that brings judgment</u>. The wicked are judged by their own words. In contrast, the righteous obey the Spirit and speak words of life. “<strong><sup>13</sup></strong> <em>An evil person is ensnared by the offense of his lips, but the righteous will escape from trouble</em>.” (Prov. 12:13). “A man by speaking unadvisedly or intemperately brings trouble upon himself, involves himself in difficulties which he did not foresee. Often when he has spoken in order to injure others, the slander or the censure has redounded on himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm"><u>Psalm 7:15, 16</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm"><u>Psalm 9:16</u></a>). The just; the man who does not offend with his lips, avoids these snares.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 12:13).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The wicked who pursue the deeds of the flesh become ensnared in their evil actions</u>. Those who are Spirit led encourage others and offer hope through Jesus (1 Thess. 5:11). In contrast, those who seek to cause harm to others through words or actions will face judgment. For example, King Xerxes I hung Haman on the gallows that he prepared for Mordecai (Esther 7:10). “But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.” (Prov. 1:18). “A fool’s mouth is his ruin, and his lips are the snare of his soul.” (Prov. 18:7). “Behold, an evil person is pregnant with injustice, and he conceives harm and gives birth to lies. He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, and has fallen into the hole which he made.” (Ps. 7:14-15). “The nations have sunk down into the pit which they have made; in the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught. The LORD has made Himself known; he has executed judgment. A wicked one is ensnared in the work of his own hands.” (Ps. 9:15-16). “The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow to take down the afflicted and the needy, to kill off those who are upright in conduct. Their sword will enter their own heart, and their bows will be broken.” (Ps. 37:14-15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous speak words of life and enjoy the fruit of the Spirit</u>. Those who keep their minds on things of the Spirit will speak words of life. Jesus will in turn reward the faithful on Earth and in heaven for their faith. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>A person will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his words, and the deeds of a person’s hands will return to him</em>.” (Prov. 12:14). “The wholesome advice, the good instruction, and sound doctrine he delivers to others, which are the fruit of his lips, and come forth by them from his heart; these redound to his own advantage, are not only a satisfaction to his mind upon reflection, but because of these he is filled with good things, even to satiety, both in this life and that to come; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm"><u>1 Timothy 4:6</u></a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 12:14).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous seek reconciliation, peace, and healing through Jesus with their words</u>. In other proverbs, Solomon extolled how the righteous seek to bring healing with their words. “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit.” (Prov. 15:4). “Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.” (Prov. 16:24). Those who use their words to serve Jesus’ good will find His contentment. “With the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied; he will be satisfied with the product of his lips. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:20-21). Thus, believers should pray and be led by the Spirit to use their words to fulfill His will and speak words of life. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous listen to Spirit-led counsel</u>. While the wicked act upon their own evil instincts, the righteous submit to Spirit-led counsel. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,</em> <em>but a person who listens to advice is wise.”</em> (Prov. 12:15). A famous pastor once observed, “You know to whom this refers, I am sure. It is Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. He refused the wise counsel of the older men in his kingdom, which resulted in his own downfall and civil war in his nation.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 12:15).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The path of wisdom is made known through Jesus, the Word, the Spirit, and counsel</u>. Out of pride, the wicked foolishly trust in their own evil instincts. “There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12). “Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.” (Prov. 3:7). In contrast, the righteous will read the Word, pray, restrain their instincts, and submit to Spirit-led counsel. “Through overconfidence comes nothing but strife, but wisdom is with those who receive counsel.” (Prov. 13:10). “You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God is opposed to the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.” (1 Pet. 5:5).</p></li>

<p>The righteous submit to Spirit-led counsel<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous restrain their flesh and obey Jesus’ command to love others</u>. In contrast to the wicked who allow their anger to explode when they are offended, the righteous will control their anger. The righteous will then show love and forgiveness. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>A fool’s anger is known at once, but a prudent person conceals dishonor</em>.” (Prov. 12:16). “The prudent man knows that to utter his indignation at reproach and shame will but lead to a fresh attack, and takes refuge in reticence.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 12:16).<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous show Jesus’ love and forgiveness to those who have hurt them</u>. When believers are hurt or offended, they are commanded to restrain their desire to respond. “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger, for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20). Those who speak words out of hatred bring judgment upon themselves. “But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be answerable to the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be answerable to the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.” (Matt. 5:22). The righteous will forgive because Jesus has forgiven them. “For if you forgive other people for their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matt. 6:14). Out of love, the righteous will also seek to conceal offenses against them. “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (Jo. 13:34).</p></li>

<h2 id="loving-truth-the-righteous-speak-jesus-truth-in-love.-prov.-1217-23."><strong>5. <u>Loving Truth: The Righteous Speak Jesus’ Truth in Love</u>. Prov. 12:17-23.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous uphold justice by speaking the truth and avoiding deceit</u>. The righteous will seek to uphold Jesus’ divine justice by testifying truthfully in any court proceeding. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>One who declares truth tells what is right, but a false witness, deceit</em>.” (Prov. 12:17). “The character of a witness affects a judicial decision … A judge can count on such a witness to assure a right verdict. By contrast, <em>perjurers</em> are the antonym of the ‘trustworthy witness’ (12:17; Ps. 119:29-30; Isa. 59:4; Jer. 5:1-2; 9:3). Witnesses have personal knowledge of the facts and so are obligated to testify. The accused’s life or death depends on reliable witness testimony (14:25). Ancients lacking modern forensic methods to independently verify the facts relied on the crucial evidence of eyewitnesses for establishing the truth (12:17; 14:5; 25; 18:21; 19:5, 9, 28; 21:28; 24:28; 25:18; 29:24; Exod. 23:1-3; Lev. 19:15).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 12:17).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous uphold God’s Ninth Commandment with truthful testimony</u>. God’s divine order is so important that judicial perjury violates His Ninth Commandment. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.” (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). This prohibition is also repeated throughout Scripture. (e.g., Lev. 19:11; Dt. 19:16-19; Prov. 6:16-19; 19:5; Matt. 15:19; 19:18; Eph. 4:25; Col. 3:9). Out of love for our neighbor, the righteous will speak only truth. “For this, ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,’ and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”’ (Ro. 13:9). “The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.” (Ps. 37:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous speak the truth with love to bring healing</u>. While the wicked say whatever comes to mind and cause pain, the righteous are careful to use their words to bring healing. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing</em>.” (Prov. 12:18). “Some people have the terrible ability to speak in a manner that stabs and slices others. Their words are like the slashing and <strong>piercings of a sword</strong>, bringing hurt instead of healing … <strong>Wise</strong> men and women are able to bring <strong>health</strong> and healing by the words they speak.” (David Guzik on Prov. 12:18).<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-12/media/image6.jpg" style="width:6.03125in;height:4.15462in" alt="Weekend Wisdom – Proverbs 12:18 – In God&#39;s Image" /></p>
<p>Let your words heal others by directing them to faith in Jesus<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous try to avoid causing pain with their words, even when speaking the truth</u>. Persons who fail to restrain their words and speak without love and compassion can cause pain. “When there are many words, wrongdoing is unavoidable, but one who restrains his lips is wise.” (Prov. 10:19). “Do not be quick with your mouth or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.” (Ecc. 5:2). The words of the righteous should instead show the same love and grace that Jesus shows them. “Words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him;” (Ecc. 10:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous speak the eternal truth of Jesus</u>. While perjury has only fleeting value to the wicked, the righteous speak Jesus’ Word of eternal truth. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>Truthful lips will endure forever, but a lying tongue is only for a moment</em>.” (Prov. 12:19). This verse is connected to Prov. 12:18. “The thought which lies below the surface is that of the inseparable union between truth and justice. The end does not justify the means, and only he who breathes and utters truth makes the righteous cause clear.” (Albert Barnes on Prov. 12:19).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>While the righteous speak Jesus’ truth, liars are in communion with Satan</u>. Jesus is the truth. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). His truth sets you free (Jo. 8:32). The righteous only speak His truth out of love. “but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, that is, Christ,” (Eph. 4:15). In contrast, the wicked who lie put themselves in communion with Satan. “You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Jo. 8:44).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous speak words of truth to bring joy and peace</u>. While the wicked cause pain with their deceit, the righteous create joy and peace with truth. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil, but counselors of peace have joy</em>.” (Prov. 12:20). “Those who plot and devise evil against others begin by deceiving them, and end by deceiving themselves also; whereas the ‘counsellors of peace,’ who seek the good of their neighbors, bring joy to them and to themselves also through the satisfaction derived from a good conscience.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 12:20).<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The fruit of the righteous includes peace and joy</u>. When a person uses truth to create peace, it is a sign of their transformation in Jesus. “And the work of righteousness will be peace, and the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.” (Is. 32:17). “And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.” (Jam. 3:18). “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.” (Ro. 12:18). “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.” (Matt. 5:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous who speak truth will be protected</u>. The wicked reap judgment from their lies. In contrast, Jesus protects those who speak His truth.“<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>No harm happens to the righteous, but the wicked are filled with trouble</em>.” (Prov. 12:21). “Proverbs 12:21 offers profound insight into the contrast between the righteousness of the just and the misfortune that befalls the wicked. The verse begins by declaring that no evil shall happen to the just. This strong affirmation reassures us that those who live by integrity and righteousness will ultimately be protected from harm. The just are not exempt from life’s challenges, but they have a promise of divine protection that comes from living a life aligned with God’s principles. Righteousness brings a sort of spiritual shield – not in the absence of trials, but in how they are faced.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 12:21).<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is a shield to those who place their trust in Him to speak truthfully</u>. In life, people face Satan’s temptations to lie or be deceitful. Those who trust in Jesus to tell the truth when it may be difficult or potentially painful will enjoy His protection. “The afflictions of the righteous are many, but the LORD rescues him from them all.” (Ps. 34:19). “These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus delights in the righteous who speak truthfully</u>. Jesus abhors the wicked who lie or conceal truth.  In contrast, those who lovingly share His truths bring Him delight. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Lying lips are an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but those who deal faithfully are His delight</em>.” (Prov. 12:22). “The word ‘abomination’ means something disgusting to God. The man that will tell it like it is, is a delight unto the Lord. The man that says there is no Hell is disgusting to God – the man that reveals the place of torment as Hell, brings delight onto the Lord, because he has told the truth.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 12:22).<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous pursue the delight of Jesus and not mankind in speaking His truths</u>. Those who try to conceal the difficult parts of the Gospel in order to be liked by mankind place themselves against God. “You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” (Jam. 4:4). The Apostle Stephen was stoned for speaking the truth about Jesus (Acts 7:54-60). Saul then placed believers in prison for speaking Jesus’ truth (Acts 8:3). After his conversion, Paul was placed in prison for speaking Jesus’ truth (Acts 16:16-40). Most of the disciples were later martyred for telling the truth about Jesus. The righteous would rather suffer for speaking the truth than conceal Jesus’ truth. Omitting parts of the Gospel to be liked is an abomination to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous only conceal truth when it might cause harm</u>. Many sinners can be rehabilitated with love and proper guidance. Thus, the righteous conceal another person’s sins until an important exception applies. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>A prudent person conceals knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaims foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 12:23). “Proverbs 12:23, a gem from the Book of Provers, delves into the realm of wisdom literature, shedding light on the significance of discretion and the pitfalls of indiscriminate sharing of knowledge. The verse encapsulates a profound truth that resonates through the ages, urging individuals to carefully consider when to speak and when to remain silent, showcasing the discernment of a prudent individual.” (Godbless.ing on Prov. 12:23).<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous only speak truth out of love or their words are not from Jesus</u>. Being righteous in Jesus’ wisdom also includes love and compassion for the person trapped in sin. “Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, but among fools it is made known.” (Prov. 14:33). Thus, if your brother or sister sins against you, you should first privately seek to resolve the conflict with that person. “Now if your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” (Matt. 18:15). Only if your brother or sister will not listen should you involve one or two others to privately try to convince the sinner (Matt. 18:16). Only if that fails can you go to church leadership (Matt. 18:17). Restoring a sinner must be done with gentleness (Gal. 6:1). Unless public safety is involved, sharing a sinner’s transgressions in any other context is gossip, which is an abomination to God and may harden the sinner.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous labor diligently to serve Jesus</u>. Jesus will entrust responsibility to those who diligently serve Him. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>The hand of the diligent will rule,</em> <em>but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor</em>.” (Prov. 12:24). “A diligent person is also faithful – diligence and faithfulness are like two brothers. Diligence also entails an element of faithfulness, and faithfulness unlocks the principle of “more” in our lives: Luke 16:10 “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.<strong> </strong>If we cannot be faithful with what we have now, we will limit ourselves from receiving more.” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 12:24).<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus will reward the righteous who labor diligently for Him<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reward the righteous who faithfully serve Him</u>. Every believer is urged to labor diligently in serving Jesus. “For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies. Now we command and exhort such persons in the Lord Jesus Christ to work peacefully and eat their own bread.” (2 Thess. 3:10-12). Those who diligently labor for Jesus with the talents that He provides will be rewarded with further responsibility. “Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, ‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have earned two more talents.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your master.’” (Matt. 25:22-23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous who labor diligently for Jesus have no reason to be anxious</u>. The pursuit of worldly wealth brings anxiety. But Jesus promises that He will provide for those who serve Him out of faith. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>Anxiety in a person’s heart weighs it down, but a good word makes it glad</em>.” (Prov. 12:25). “Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigor in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 12:25).<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus provides for those who labor diligently with their eyes on Him</u>. Believers are told not to worry. “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.” (Phil. 4:6). If you seek first to diligently serve Jesus, He will provide. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous diligently work to guide the lost to Jesus</u>. The wicked can lead people astray. In contrast, the righteous should diligently work to bring their neighbors to faith in Jesus. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>The righteous person is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray</em>.” (Prov. 12:26). “The Bible says that the righteous is a ‘guide to his neighbor,’ but ‘the way of the wicked leads them astray.’ This scripture contrasts the positive and negative impact people can have on others. A righteous person, friend, or mentor can lead someone the right way and “guide” them to where they should be going. This is why the Bible says that iron sharpens iron: Proverbs 27:17 Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. This means that one person sharpens another and challenges them to be better and do better.” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 12:26).<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous are Jesus’ light to the lost</u>. Bad company can corrupt a person’s walk (1 Cor. 15:33). Thus, believers must be careful to avoid being unequally yoked with nonbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14). But believers should also labor diligently to be a light to their lost neighbors. “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous consider their diligent labor for Jesus as a labor of love</u>. While the wicked cannot find lasting contentment through their covetousness, the righteous will find contentment by diligently serving Jesus. “<strong><sup>27</sup></strong> <em>A lazy person does not roast his prey, but the precious possession of a person is diligence</em>.” (Prov. 12:27). “This entire context leads us to realize that diligence is not just about individual success but rather about how we can contribute positively to our communities, our families, and ultimately, our relationship with God. We are challenged to embrace a lifestyle that seeks to maximize all that God places in our hands.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 12:27).<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous find satisfaction diligently serving Jesus</u>. Solomon promised prosperity for the “soul” for those who are “diligent” in their service to God. “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). The righteous diligently serve Jesus out of love for Him. “Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor, not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;” (Ro. 12:10-11). “Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.” (Gal. 6:9). “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for people,” (Col. 3:23). “With goodwill render service, as to the Lord, and not to people,” (Eph. 6:7).</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-path-the-righteous-walk-in-jesus-narrow-path-of-eternal-life-and-seek-to-share-their-hope-with-the-lost.-prov.-1228."><strong>7. <u>Jesus’ Path: The Righteous Walk in Jesus’ Narrow Path of Eternal Life and Seek to Share Their Hope With the Lost</u>. Prov. 12:28.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous pursue the way of life through Jesus</u>. While the wicked follow the wide path leading to destruction, the righteous walk in Jesus’ narrow path of life. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>In the way of righteousness there is life, and in its pathway there is no death</em>.” (Prov. 12:28). “One that is in the true way of righteousness is one that is instilled by the righteousness of Christ, … by which he is justified before God, entitles him to eternal life; to which the path of holiness, he is directed and enabled to walk in, leads; though it is a narrow way, and a strait gate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-14.htm"><u>Matthew 7:14</u></a>. Christ, and righteousness and holiness in and by him, are the way, the truth, and the life, or the true way to eternal life; and all in this way now live spiritually, and shall live eternally, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm"><u>John 14:6</u></a>;and in the pathway thereof there is no death; no condemnation to them that are in Christ,” (John Gill on Prov. 12:28).<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous stay on Jesus’ narrow path out of love and devotion</u>. Many are enticed to follow the path leading to destruction. But the righteous follow Jesus’ narrow path. “For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:14; Lk. 13:24). There is no other path to become righteous. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). “And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among mankind by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous will lead others to Jesus’ narrow path</u>. Jesus calls upon the righteous to share the hope of the Good News with the lost (Matt. 28:19-20; Jam. 5:20; Ro. 10:15; 2 Cor. 5:20). “And He said to them, ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of people.”’ (Matt. 4:19). Jesus desires for the righteous to respond to His call to guide the lost. “And He was saying to them, ‘The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.”’ (Lk. 10:2).</p></li>
