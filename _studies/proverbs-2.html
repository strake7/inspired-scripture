<h1 id="proverbs-2-lessons-on-jesus-true-wisdom-part-ii"><strong>Proverbs 2: Lessons on Jesus’ True Wisdom (Part II)</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 2 continues Solomon’s prologue to the book of Proverbs (Prov. 1:8-8:36). Here, Solomon taught his son (possibly his heir Rehoboam) about the value of Yahweh’s wisdom. Yahweh is again another name for the great “I AM”. In the New Testament, Jesus reveals that He is the great “I AM” (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Many of Solomon’s statements build upon Job’s declaration about true wisdom in Job 28. Based upon Solomon’s statements, the Bible reveals that Jesus’ wisdom should be pursued: (1) with diligence, (2) from Him alone, (3) for protection, (4) for discernment, (5) for deliverance, (6) for guidance, and (7) for salvation.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon urged his son to diligently pursue Yahweh’s wisdom as a treasure the same way a person might mine for precious metals.  Jesus also wants you to diligently pursue and guard His wisdom in your heart as your greatest treasure.<strong> </strong>  <u>Second</u>, Solomon told his son that true wisdom comes from Yahweh alone.  The New Testament also confirms that true wisdom comes from Jesus alone.<strong> </strong> <u>Third</u>, Solomon encouraged his son that Yahweh would be a shield to him if he obeyed Yahweh’s wisdom.  Jesus came to fulfill this promise.<strong> </strong> <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon promised that Yahweh’s wisdom would help him to discern between good and evil.  Jesus also came to fulfill this promise.<strong> </strong> <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon promised his son that Yahweh’s wisdom could rescue him from the plans of evil people.  Jesus again came to fulfill this promise.  <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon told his son that Yahweh’s wisdom could also guide his path.  Jesus also fulfills this promise when you read His Word and pray.  <u>Finally</u>, Solomon promised that Yahweh’s wisdom leads to salvation for those who follow it and death for those who reject it.  Jesus again came to fulfill this promise.  He offers all a single path to salvation that runs through faith in His atoning sacrifice at the cross.</p>
<h2 id="diligence-jesus-wants-you-to-diligently-pursue-and-memorize-his-wisdom-as-your-greatest-treasure.-prov.-21-5."><strong>1. <u>Diligence: Jesus Wants You to Diligently Pursue and Memorize His Wisdom as Your Greatest Treasure</u>. Prov. 2:1-5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to consistently search out and memorize His wisdom</u>. Solomon urged his son to continuously seek out Yahweh’s wisdom the same way a person might mine for silver. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>My son, if you will receive my words and treasure my commandments within you, <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>make your ear attentive to wisdom; incline your heart to understanding. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For if you cry out for insight, and raise your voice for understanding; <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures; <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>then you will understand the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and discover the knowledge of God.”</em> (Prov. 2:1-5). As one commentator observes, “This implies <em>effort</em>. The <strong>heart</strong> must be <em>applied</em> to <strong>understanding</strong>. It won’t happen by accident. This wisdom, <strong>discernment</strong>, and <strong>understanding</strong> must be sought out as if it were <strong>silver</strong> and <strong>hidden treasures</strong>. In these few verses, Solomon described many ways that we must seek after wisdom. · Receive. · Treasure. · Incline. · Apply. · Cry out, lift up the voice. · Seek, search… Solomon established the principle that the <strong>fear of the LORD</strong> is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Proverbs+1.7&amp;t=NKJV">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Here he teaches us that without the <em>effort</em> to seek out wisdom, we will lack in our <strong>fear of the LORD</strong> and <strong>knowledge of God</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 2:2-5) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Like precious metals, wisdom requires sustained work to obtain it</u>. Job began a similar revelation by analogizing the search for wisdom to the process required to convert raw materials into precious metals: “<sup>1</sup><em> </em>Certainly there is a mine for silver and a place for refining gold. <sup>2<em> </em></sup>Iron is taken from the dust, and copper is smelted from rock<em>.</em>” (Job 28:1-2). During Old Testament times, this included the use of hand-held picks to slowly carve out the rocks. The process frequently involved the creation of dams to power wheels. The process also required the creation of candles to bring light to the caverns. A similar process is needed for Jesus’ wisdom. His wisdom also requires diligent effort to find it and understand it. This includes regularly reading His Word, memorizing it, and prayer. Just as a single strike against a mountain with a pick will not reveal its treasures, a single prayer or a single reading of a Bible verse will not reveal Jesus’ wisdom. To fully mine Yahweh’s wisdom, Solomon stated “And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom about everything that has been done under heaven...” (Ecc. 1:13a). Are you mining Jesus’ Word every day, memorizing it, and praying about it to apply His wisdom?</p></li>

<p>Search Jesus’ Word and pray on a daily basis to find true understanding and wisdom<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Diligence requires daily prayer and reading the Word</u>. The search for God’s wisdom does not end until you get to heaven. Just as the Jews had to turn every day to God in the wilderness for their mana, you must turn daily to God through prayer and reading the Word to find how His wisdom applies to the changing needs of your life. “Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and moan, and He will hear my voice.” (Ps. 55:17). You must also listen and apply the wisdom that God provides: “The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, So that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.” (Is. 50:4). Are you reading the Word and praying every day so that God can guide you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The treasure of God’s wisdom is greater than any precious metal found on Earth</u>. While mankind considers the precious metals that it can uncover to be its most valuable resource, Job revealed that the value of God’s wisdom is greater than any precious stone: “<sup>15<em> </em></sup>Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, nor can silver be weighed as its price. <sup>16<em> </em></sup>It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx, or sapphire. <sup>17 </sup>Gold or glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for articles of pure gold. <sup>18<em> </em></sup>Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned; and the acquisition of wisdom is more valuable than pearls. <sup>19 </sup>The topaz of Cush cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold<em>.”</em> (Job 28:15-19). While most people spend their time pursuing worldly treasure, believers should spend their time pursuing heavenly treasure. A normal person will go to great lengths to protect their precious metals and wealth. Believers should also go to great lengths to guard God’s Word in their hearts as a hidden treasure.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is worth more than any earthly honor or treasure</u>. As a young king, God tested Solomon to determine his greatest desire. Solomon passed God’s test. Instead of asking for riches or power, Solomon asked for God’s wisdom to rule His people: “<sup>7 </sup>In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, ‘Ask what I shall give you.’ <sup>8 </sup>Solomon said to God, ‘You have dealt with my father David with great lovingkindness, and have made me king in his place. <sup>9 </sup>Now, O Lord God, Your promise to my father David is fulfilled, for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. <sup>10 </sup>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?’” (2 Chr. 1:7-10; 1 Kgs. 3:4-9). After later turning to a life of covetousness, Solomon lamented that God’s wisdom was greater than any of the wealth that he had accumulated: “How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver.” (Prov. 16:16). “How blessed is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver and her gain better than fine gold. She is more precious than jewels; and nothing you desire compares with her.” (Prov. 3:13-15). “Accept my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than jewels; and all desirable things cannot compare with her . . . My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, and my yield better than choicest silver.” (Prov. 8:10-11, 19). “Buy truth, and do not sell it, get wisdom, instruction, and understanding.” (Prov 23:23). Do you desire the riches of Jesus’ wisdom over the amount of your wealth?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Vigilantly guard Jesus’ Word in your heart</u>. Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes His wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44). This includes memorizing His Word: “I have treasured Your word in my heart, so that I may not sin against You.” (Ps. 119:11). If you fail to guard His Word as a hidden treasure, Satan will seek to draw you away from it: “The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky ate it up.” (Lk. 8:5). To protect yourself, are you treating the revelation of Jesus’ wisdom as a hidden treasure by memorizing it and meditating on it?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom</u>. Job concluded his poem about wisdom by stating that true wisdom comes from fearing God by turning away from evil<em>:</em> “<sup>28<em> </em></sup>And to mankind He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding<em>.</em>’” (Job 28:18). In Proverbs 1, Solomon also stated that “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). Here, he reveals that the diligent study of the Word “<em>will understand the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and discover the knowledge of God.”</em> (Prov. 2:5).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependence-jesus-wants-you-to-depend-upon-him-alone-as-your-source-for-true-wisdom.-prov.-26."><strong>2. <u>Dependence: Jesus Wants You to Depend Upon Him Alone as Your Source for True Wisdom</u>. Prov. 2:6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Rely upon only Jesus for true wisdom</u>. Solomon, the wisest man alive until Jesus, he made clear that true wisdom come from only Yahweh. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding</em>.” (Prov. 2:6). “Thus he teaches them not to ascribe any wisdom they might attain to their own abilities or industry, but only to God’s favor and blessing.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 2:6).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Unlike precious metals, wisdom can only be found in Jesus</u>. While human ingenuity can allow mankind to find precious metals buried deep within the Earth, mankind cannot discover and produce true wisdom unless they seek it through faith in Jesus. Job agreed. “<sup>12 </sup>But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? <sup>13 </sup>Mankind does not know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living. <sup>14<em> </em></sup>The ocean depth says, ‘It is not in me’; and the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’” (Job 28:12-14). Jesus wants you to have the same zeal in your faith as a miner seeking hidden gold or silver.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The ability to understand God’s wisdom is part of what makes mankind unique</u>. Wisdom has a source that is only available to mankind. Like precious stones buried in a mountain, only mankind has the God-given tools to find and apply His wisdom. Job observed: “<sup>3<em> </em></sup>Man puts an end to darkness, and to the farthest limit he searches out the rock in gloom and deep shadow. <sup>4<em> </em></sup>He sinks a shaft away from inhabited areas, forgotten by the foot; they hang and swing, away from people. <sup>5</sup> From the earth comes food, and underneath, it is turned over like fire. <em><sup>6 </sup></em>Its rocks are the source of sapphires, and its dust contains gold. <sup>7<em> </em></sup>No bird of prey knows the path, nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it. <sup>8 </sup>The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the lion passed over it. <sup>9<em> </em></sup>He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the base. <sup>10 </sup>He carves out channels through the rocks, and his eye sees anything precious. <sup>11<em> </em></sup>He dams up the streams from flowing, and brings to light what is hidden.” (Job 28:3-11). Thus, your ability to learn and understand divine wisdom is one of the many things that distinguish you from creation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers His wisdom to all who diligently seek it</u>. Jesus promises that if you diligently read His Word and pray, He will reveal wisdom to you: “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in secret You will make wisdom known to me.” (Ps. 51:6). “For to a person who is good in His sight, He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, . ..” (Ecc. 2:26). When you pray and submit to God, the Holy Spirit will guide your path and reveal Jesus’ wisdom: “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13). “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:16). Thus, you need wisdom, regularly read the Word and pray.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom cannot be mined from any source besides Him</u>. Because true wisdom only comes from Jesus, mankind cannot hope to find it from other sources: “<sup>20 </sup>Where then does wisdom come from? And where is this place of understanding? <sup>21<em> </em></sup>It is hidden from the eyes of every living creature, and concealed from the birds of the sky<em>.</em>’” (Job 28:20-22). Even Solomon confessed that that even he could not find true wisdom through his own efforts: “I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, ‘I will be wise,’ but wisdom was far from me. What has been is remote and very mysterious. Who can discover it?” (Ecc. 7:23-24). Thus, Solomon stated that wisdom comes from Yahweh: “For the LORD gives wisdom; <em>from His mouth come knowledge and understanding</em>.” (Prov. 2:6). The New Testament reveals that true wisdom comes through Jesus. “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, <em>who became to us wisdom from God</em>, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Paul also stated that God’s wisdom was beyond his ability to find it on his own (Ro. 11:33-34). But Paul also revealed that God’s hidden wisdom is made known to us through faith in Jesus (Col. 2:2-3). Jesus’ wisdom is a gift that comes from knowing Him as your Lord and Savior and diligent study. “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, <em>may give you a spirit of wisdom</em> and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.” (Eph. 1:17; 3:8, 10).</p></li>

<h2 id="protection-jesus-becomes-your-shield-of-protection-when-you-follow-his-wisdom.-prov.-27-8."><strong>3. <u>Protection: Jesus Becomes Your Shield of Protection When You Follow His Wisdom</u>. Prov. 2:7-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom can be your shield of protection</u>. Solomon advised his son that Yahweh’s wisdom would also be a shield of protection if he followed it. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>guarding the paths of justice, and He watches over the way of His godly ones</em>.” (Prov. 2:7-8). “<em>To them that walk uprightly</em> [KJV]; literally, <strong>to the walkers in innocence</strong> (<span dir="rtl">לְחֹלֵכֵי תֹם</span>, <strong>l'khol'key thom</strong>).  <span dir="rtl">תֹם</span> (<strong>thom</strong>) is ‘integrity of mind,’ ‘moral faultlessness,’ ‘innocence.’ ‘To walk uprightly’ is to maintain a course of life regulated by right principles, and directed to right ends. He ‘walks uprightly who lives with the fear of God as his principle, the Word of God as his rule, and the glory of God as his end.”’ (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 2:7).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ wisdom also leads to His shield against the attacks of the evil one<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He can make you righteous</u>. Although all have sinned and deserve judgment, Jesus can also make you righteous: “For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.” (Ro. 5:19). Because He has made you righteous, He calls upon you to keep yourself consecrated by staying holy (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2). Are you living your life as a holy living sacrifice for Jesus (Ro. 12:1-2)?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who seek His righteousness and walk with integrity</u>. A psalmist proclaimed that God will not withhold any good thing from those who live with godly integrity: “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God is a sun and shield; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.” (Ps. 84:11). Your integrity and righteousness should be the fruit of your faith and your love for God: “Turn from evil and do good, so that you will dwell forever.” (Ps. 37:27). “Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” (Ps. 34:14). “Learn to do good; seek justice, rebuke the oppressor, obtain justice for the orphan, plead for the widow’s case.” (Is. 1:17; Jam. 1:27). “Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does what is good is of God; the one who does what is evil has not seen God.” (2 Jo. 1:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Live according to Jesus’ righteousness, and He will bless you with protection</u>. Although salvation is not based upon your works, Jesus will bless those who seek His righteousness and live in integrity: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.” (Matt. 5:6). “For You bless the righteous person, LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12). “Fear the LORD, you His saints; for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything.” (Ps. 34:9). “He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry for help and save them.” (Ps. 145:19). “What the wicked fears will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted.” (Prov. 10:24). “One who pursues righteousness and loyalty finds life, righteousness, and honor.” (Prov. 21:21). “for bodily training is just slightly beneficial, but godliness is beneficial for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.” (1Tim. 4:8). Are you giving Jesus reasons to bless you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is also a shield to those who pray for His refuge</u>.  Another psalmist prayed for God to be “<em>our shield,</em>” (Ps. 84:9). David also praised God as his “shield”:  “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2). “He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.”  (2 Sam. 22:31).  “But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.”  (Ps. 3:3).  “For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12). Proverbs also called God a shield:  “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.”  (Prov. 30:5).  When you cry out to Jesus in prayer and make Him your refuge, He is faithful to be your shield against the evil one.</p></li>

Prov. 2:9-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom brings the blessing of discernment</u>. Solomon promised his son that if he faithfully followed Yahweh’s wisdom, he would have the ability to discern between good and evil and to enjoy His blessings. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Then you will discern righteousness, justice, and integrity, and every good path. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be delightful to your soul</em>;” (Prov. 2:9-10). “This is another fruit and effect of the Gospel, and of a spiritual understanding of it; that besides the knowledge of God, and how to behave with reverence towards him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm"><u>Proverbs 2:5</u></a>; it leads men into a notion of doing that which is right and just among men; it gives them not only a theoretic but a practical understanding of justice, and a true judgment of what is right and wrong; or gives such an understanding thereof as that they practice it; for it teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm"><u>Titus 2:11</u></a>.” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 2:9).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will give you discernment through the Word and prayer</u>.  Jesus’ Word will guide you in distinguishing good from evil. With diligent prayer, He and the Holy Spirit will then apply His wisdom to your specific circumstances (Jam. 1:5; Ps. 51:6; Prov. 2:6). </p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust that God’s wisdom is superior to yours</u>. The Bible warns against those who rely upon their own wisdom: “Thus says the LORD, ‘<em>Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom</em>, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 9:23-24). “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). When you reject the wisdom of God’s will, you commit the sin of believing that your intellect is greater than God’s. This ultimately leads to disaster. “There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12). Because Jesus knows everything, you can put your trust in Him: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “Commit your way to the LORD, trust also in Him, and He will do it.” (Ps. 37:5). “Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah” (Ps. 62:8). “Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation.” (Is. 12:2). Are you trusting in God’s Word or yourself?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Test the wisdom that you receive to make sure that it is from Jesus</u>. Jeremiah warned that there will be many who falsely claim to speak for God (Jer. 14:14). Thus, Jesus warns believers to “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.” (Matt. 7:15). “Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.” (Matt. 24:11, 24). It is therefore important to test every person who claims to speak on God’s behalf “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but <em>test the spirits</em> to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.” (1 Jo. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:16; 1 Thess. 5:21). Deceiving spirits may also come across as “angels of light” (2 Cor. 11:14-15). For those who rely upon them to reject Jesus’ true wisdom, the path they offer leads to only sorrow and eventual destruction.</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-jesus-wisdom-can-rescue-you-when-evil-people-seek-to-place-you-into-bondage.-prov.-211-19."><strong>5. <u>Deliverance: Jesus’ Wisdom Can Rescue You When Evil People Seek to Place You into Bondage</u>. Prov. 2:11-19.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom can also rescue you from bondage</u>. Solomon also promised his son that Yahweh’s wisdom could rescue him from evil people who would seek to entrap him. “<strong><sup>11<em> </em></sup></strong><em>discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>to rescue you from the way of evil, from a person who speaks perverse things; <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>from those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>who delight in doing evil and rejoice in the perversity of evil; <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways; <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>to rescue you from the strange woman, from the foreign woman who flatters with her words, <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>who leaves the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>for her house sinks down to death, and her tracks lead to the dead; <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>none who go to her return, nor do they reach the paths of life</em>.” (Prov. 2:11-19). “The address flows on continuously and describes how wisdom as a shield preserves from the evil man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12-15</a>), and from the evil woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16-19</a>).” (Thomas Thomason Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Prov. 2:11-19).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom can deliver you from those acting under Satan’s influence</u>. Solomon stated that God’s wisdom can “<em>rescue you from the way of evil”</em> and those “<em>who delight in doing evil and rejoice in the perversity of evil;</em>” (Prov. 2:11, 14). These refer to the attacks of evil people. But this also speaks to Jesus’ deliverance from people walking under Satan’s influence. “The enemy is spoken of as one (v. 12), an <em>evil man</em> (KJB), but afterwards as many (v. 13); there is a club, a gang of them, that are in confederacy against religion, and join hand in hand for the support of the devil's kingdom and the interests of it. [1.] They have a spirit of contradiction to that which is good: They <em>speak froward things</em>; they say all they can against religion, both to show their own enmity to it and to dissuade others from it. They are advocates for Satan; they plead for Baal, and <em>pervert the right ways of the Lord</em>.  … They are pleased if they can discern that the devil's kingdom gets ground (see Rom 1:32), such a height of impiety have they arrived at …Every wise man will shun the company of such as these.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 2:12, 14).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom can deliver you from both sexual and spiritual sins</u>. Jesus’ wisdom can also “<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>rescue you from the strange woman, from the foreign woman who flatters with her words, <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>who leaves the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</em>” (Prov. 2:16-17). This can include deliverance for someone seduced into sexual sins. But Solomon then stated “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>for her house sinks down to death, and her tracks lead to the dead; <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>none who go to her return, nor do they reach the paths of life</em>.” (Prov. 2:18-19). This also suggests spiritual adultery against God. “Sexual unfaithfulness on the historical plane may be seen as a paradigm for spiritual unfaithfulness to <em>I AM</em>. Solomon’s sexual infidelity contributed to his spiritual infidelity because the sexual and spiritual interpenetrate one another existentially. The prophets frequently used marriage as a metaphor for Israel’s relationship to <em>I AM.</em>. This woman’s breaking her marriage contract is comparable to covenant children today breaking their contract with Christ. The end result will be death.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 2:19).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom can help you from becoming unequally yoked</u>.  Various psalmists proclaimed that they would avoid spiritual compromise with those who reject God and His standards of right and wrong:  “I do not sit with deceitful people, nor will I go with pretenders.”  (Ps. 26:4).  “As for the works of mankind, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the ways of the violent.”  (Ps. 17:4).  “I have restrained my feet from every evil way, so that I may keep Your word.”  (Ps. 119:101).  The Apostle Paul also warned of the dangers of spiritual compromise that come from being unequally yoked together with nonbelievers:  “Do not be mismatched with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness share together, or what does light have in common with darkness?”  (2 Cor. 6:4).  If you join yourself together with a non-believer, you may also be pulled away from God.  This undermines the contentment that comes from being in a relationship with God.  Instead of pursuing the path of nonbelievers, believers must take the narrow path through Jesus:  “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.  For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.”  (Matt. 7:13-14).  To avoid being unequally yoked, you must pray for Jesus’ wisdom.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’s wisdom can guide your path to stay holy</u>. Solomon further promised his son that Yahweh’s wisdom would teach him how to identify Yahweh’s path of righteousness. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>So you will walk in the way of good people and keep to the paths of the righteous</em>.” (Prov. 2:20). “The way of a good man leads him away from the snare that a strange woman would try to prepare for him. A good man is not led about by the fleshly desires, but he seeks the righteous paths so his life might be blessed rather than cursed. The simple one laughs at wisdom and falls into the way of the sinful woman. He never returns to the same heights of holiness.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 2:20).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Pray for Jesus’ wisdom to stay on the right path<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus’ Word guide your path through study and prayer</u>. Jesus’ Word is His guiding light to keep you on His holy path and away from the paths leading to bondage. “<em>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</em>” (Ps. 119:105). “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and rebukes for discipline are the way of life” (Prov. 6:23). “And so we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:19). Jesus will apply His Word to your life when you study it and pray for His wisdom (Jam. 1:5-6). “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, <em>He will guide you into all the truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through obedience to Jesus’ path, He offers protection</u>. The psalmist declared that he would not “<em>forget Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:109). Because he did “<em>not wandered from</em> [God’s] <em>precepts</em>,” he did not need to worry that “<em>The wicked have set a trap for me,</em>…” (Ps. 119:110). “For it is He who rescues you from the net of the trapper...” (Ps. 91:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through obedience to Jesus’ path, He offers joy</u>.  The Bible’s testimonies became the psalmist’s joy.  “<strong><sup> </sup></strong>I have inherited Your testimonies forever, for they are the joy of my heart<em>.</em>”  (Ps. 119:111).  Thus, he vowed to memorize and continually follow them.  “I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever, even to the end.”  (Ps. 119:112).  You can also rejoice over the way of life made known to you through the Word.  “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.”  (Ps. 16:11).  But you must also stay on His path.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom offers the path of salvation</u>. Finally, Solomon advised his son that Yahweh’s wisdom offered the path to life while the path of the wicked leads to death. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>but the wicked will be eliminated from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it</em>.” (Prov. 2:21-22). David made a similar promise for those with faith in Yahweh. “<em><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong></em>For evildoers will be eliminated, but those who wait for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, they will inherit the land.” (Ps. 37:9). “The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 2:21-22).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers the path to eternal salvation</u>. In the Old Testament, many Jews understood that their souls went to a place called (<span dir="rtl">שְׁאוֹל</span>) “<em>Sheol</em>” upon death (e.g., Prov. 1:12; Pss. 16:10; 18:5; 49:14, 88:3; 116:3; 139:8; 2 Sam. 22:6; Hos. 13:14; 5:5; 7:27; 15:11; 27:20; Job 26:6; Is. 14:11, 15; 38:18; Ezek. 31:17).  But the psalmists had faith that God would redeem the souls of those made righteous through their faith.  “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 88:13). “For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.” (Ps. 116:8). “I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the LORD.” (Ps. 118:17). God also promised that He would “ransom” souls from <em>Sheol</em> (Hos. 13:14).  He further promised that a miraculous resurrection would take place.  “Your dead will live; their corpses will rise.  You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, for your dew is as the dew of the dawn, and the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.” (Is. 26:19; Ezek. 37:12-14).  Jesus came to fulfill these prophecies. Through faith in Him, you can live forever with Him in heaven “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “By this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him.” (1 Jo. 4:9). He further offers abundant life with Him in heaven. “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.” (Jo. 10:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wise will pray for the wisdom to stay on Jesus’ narrow path leading to eternal life</u>.  Solomon makes clear that there are two paths leading to life and death (Prov. 2:21-22).  Jesus further reveals that the path leading to life is a narrow one.  “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.  For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.”  (Matt. 7:13-14: Jo. 10:9).  The fear of the LORD should prompt everyone to pray for the wisdom to stay on His narrow path.</p></li>
