Kings 12: Lessons from Rehoboam and Jeroboam Regarding the Signs and
Warnings that Come from Rebellious Leaders</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: 1 Kings 12 through 14 describe the evil actions
of two leaders, who led Israel into division and then idolatry. Through
his evil actions, Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, divided Israel into two
nations. He was then left to rule just the southern kingdom of Judah
from 931 to 913 B.C. Likewise, through his evil actions, Jeroboam,
Solomon’s disgruntled former servant, caused 10 tribes to break away and
form the northern Kingdom of Israel, which he ruled from 931 to 910 B.C.
Along with 2 Chronicles 10 through 12, these chapters also record the
sad royal adoption of idolatry in first the northern kingdom of Israel
(1 Kgs. 12:25-14:20) and then the southern kingdom of Judah (1 Kgs.
14:21-31). Because of their evil actions, Israel would remain divided
until and through its future captivity and exile at the hands of foreign
powers. Through the mistakes of these leaders, God reveals seven signs
and warnings regarding foolish leaders.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, after Solomon’s death, the people complained to
Rehoboam regarding the forced labor and taxes that Solomon imposed upon
them to build up the nation. In response to their complaints, Rehoboam
wisely consulted with his elders. Yet, when the elders encouraged him to
address the people’s suffering, he then rejected their wise counsel.
From Rehoboam’s mistake, God warns that a foolish leader rejects the
Spirit-led advice of elders. <u>Second</u>, Rehoboam then sought out the
counsel of his young friends and servants, who appealed to his pride and
urged him to show an iron fist towards the disgruntled people. From
Rehoboam’s mistake, God warns that a foolish leader listens to those who
promote pride or oppression. <u>Third</u>, in response to their
complaints, Rehoboam then threatened the people with even greater
hardships than they experienced under Solomon. This ignited the people
with rage. From Rehoboam’s mistakes, God warns that a foolish leader
acts with cruelty or without love towards others. <u>Fourth</u>,
Jeroboam hated Solomon after being forced into exile. He then incited
the people’s anger to kill one of Rehoboam’s servants and then to divide
the nation into two kingdoms. From his mistakes, God warns that a
foolish leader is unforgiving and sows division or rebellion.
<u>Fifth</u>, in response to Jeroboam’s rebellion, Rehoboam tried and
failed to stop it using force. Through his High Priest, he would have
known that God warned in advance of this punishment as a response to
Solomon’s worship of pagan gods and his building of pagan places of
worship. Instead of leading the nation in repentance, Rehoboam thought
that he could prevent God’s prophecy from coming true through force.
Through his mistake, God warns that a foolish leader is unrepentant and
uses threats to impose his will. <u>Sixth</u>, to prevent the people
from returning back to Jerusalem and embracing a unified Israel,
Jeroboam built golden caves and unauthorized places of worship in
northern Israel. In response to his actions, ten tribes openly embraced
idolatry. From Jeroboam’s evil actions, God warns that a foolish leader
embraces idolatry or causes others to stumble. <u>Finally</u>, Jeroboam
created a counterfeit priesthood and his unholy worship practices to
keep the people from worshiping Yahweh in the manner He commanded. From
Jeroboam’s evil acts, God warns that a foolish leader does not fear Him
and instead embraces Satan’s counterfeit to God’s Word.</p>

<u>A</u> Rebellious <u>Leader Rejects the Spirit-Led Advice of
Elders</u>. 1 Kgs. 12:1-8.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam rejects the wise counsel of his elders to show
kindness to his people</u>. Before the northern tribes would accept
Rehoboam as their new king, the people asked him to change Solomon’s
forced labor and taxation practices. Rehoboam at first wisely sought the
advice of Israel’s elders. Yet, he rejected their counsel when they
wisely urged him to show compassion: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then Rehoboam
went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
<sup>2 </sup>Now when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, he was
living in Egypt (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the
presence of King Solomon). <sup>3 </sup>Then they sent and called him,
and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam,
saying, <sup>4 </sup>‘Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore
lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put
on us, and we will serve you.’ <sup>5 </sup>Then he said to them,
‘Depart for three days, then return to me.’ So the people departed.
<sup>6 </sup>King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his
father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, ‘How do you counsel me
to answer this people?’ <sup>7 </sup>Then they spoke to him, saying, ‘If
you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and
grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will
be your servants forever.’ <sup>8 </sup>But he forsook the counsel of
the elders which they had given him, and consulted with the young men
who grew up with him and served him</em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:1-8). Even though
Jerusalem was now the nation’s capital, the 12 tribes still met at
Shechem. Abraham and Jacob both worshiped at this sacred place (Gen.
12:6; 33:18-20). Joseph was also buried there (Josh. 24:32). It was the
place where the tribes met for periodic covenant renewal ceremonies
(Gen. 12:6-7; 33:18-20; Josh. 24:1-27, 32). This was also a central
place near Mount Ephraim where the Jews had gathered to select leaders
since Abimelech (Jdgs. 9:6). Jeroboam, the Ephraimite, previously
rebelled against Solomon (1 Kgs. 11:26). He was a populist whose name
means “he who enlarges the people”. According to Jewish tradition, he
opposed Solomon’s forced labor practices that he used to build up
Jerusalem's infrastructure. After learning that God intended to give
part of the kingdom to Jeroboam to punish Solomon for his idolatry,
Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam. Yet, Jeroboam then fled to Egypt (1 Kgs.
11:40). Now that Solomon was dead, Jeroboam returned to lead the
northern tribes in their complaints against Solomon’s forced labor and
heavy taxation requirements (1Kgs. 4:7; 5:13; 9:22; 11:28). Solomon’s
use of forced labor was one of the many consequences that Samuel warned
would happen if the people rejected God’s will and demanded to be
governed by a king: “He said, ‘This will be the procedure of the king
who will reign over you: he will take your sons and place them for
himself in his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before
his chariots.”’ (1 Sam. 8:11). Because of his pride, Rehoboam rejected
the advice of his elders to address the people’s complaints. He feared
that if he were to lessen Solomon’s forced labor practices or reduce the
amount of taxation, his wealth, power, and influence would be
reduced.</p></li>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam failed to follow Solomon’s example by praying
for God’s wisdom</u>. After his brother Adonijah’s failed coup d'etat, a
young Solomon also faced a doubtful nation when he assumed power (1 Kgs.
1:5-53). After leading the nation in repentance, he then humbly asked
God for the wisdom to lead the people: “So give Your servant an
understanding heart to judge Your people to discern between good and
evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?” (1 Kgs.
3:9). Despite countless other brothers through Solomon’s 1,000 wives who
would have coveted his power, Rehoboam did not even think to consult God
in prayer. Nor did he accept that his true power and right to be king
came from God. Like many people, he also denied the power of prayer for
answering problems. God promises His wisdom for any who ask in faith
(Jam. 1:5). Do you petition God in prayer for answers to the dilemmas
that you face each day?</p></li>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam also rejected Solomon’s and Job’s pleas that he
listen to wise counsel</u>. Rehoboam also rejected his own father’s
Proverbs on God’s wisdom: “Hear, my son, your father’s instruction . . .
;” (Prov. 1:8). “Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, and give
attention that you may gain understanding,” (Prov. 4:1). In his
proverbs, Solomon warned Rehoboam to listen to Spirit-led counsel of his
elders and not rely upon his own understanding: “The way of a fool is
right in his own eyes, but a wise man is he who listens to counsel.”
(Prov. 12:15). “Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be
wise the rest of your days.” (Prov. 19:20). “Heed instruction and be
wise, and do not neglect it.” (Prov. 8:33). Job also gave this same
advice in his writings: “Wisdom is with aged men, with long life is
understanding.” (Job 12:12). “I thought age should speak, and increased
years should teach wisdom.” (Job. 32:37). In addition to reading the
Word and praying, do you seek advice from wise Spirit-led elders in your
church?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Like the wise counselors, Jesus is compassionate to those who
suffer from oppression</u>. The elders gave Spirit-led advice because
they urged Rehoboam to show compassion toward the people. As our
example, Jesus showed us that a leader should always have compassion
when people are suffering: “Seeing the people, He felt compassion for
them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a
shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36; Mk. 6:34). “I feel compassion for the people
because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to
eat.” (Matt. 8:2). When you see people suffering or when people complain
to you, do you show compassion or indifference towards them?</p></li>
<li><p><u>A wise leader serves God’s people and not him or herself</u>.
If Rehoboam were interested in being a Spirit-led leader, he would have
looked for ways to serve his people. Again as our example, Jesus
revealed that He came to serve others, not Himself: “just as the Son of
Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a
ransom for many.” (Matt. 20:28). Do you seek to serve God’s people? Or,
do you live to serve yourself?</p></li>

<u>A</u> Rebellious <u>Leader Listens to Those Who Promote Pride or
Oppression</u>. 1 Kgs. 12:9-11.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam listened to the foolish advice of his servants,
who advocated oppression</u>. After rejecting the wise advice of
Israel’s elders, Rehoboam sought out the advice of his young servants.
His young servants knew Rehoboam and appealed to his vanity and pride by
urging him to use oppression in response to the people’s complaints:
“<sup>9 </sup><em>So he said to them, ‘What counsel do you give that we
may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke
which your father put on us’?’ <sup>10 </sup>The young men who grew up
with him spoke to him, saying, ‘Thus you shall say to this people who
spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it
lighter for us!’ But you shall speak to them, ‘My little finger is
thicker than my father’s loins! <sup>11 </sup>Whereas my father loaded
you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined
you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.</em>’’” (1
Kgs. 12:9-11). Rehoboam was about 40 years old (1 Kgs. 14:21). His
contemporaries had grown rich under Solomon’s taxation system. Thus, out
of their own self-interest, they appealed to Solomon’s pride to reject
the people’s demands. They further urged him to tax the people even
more.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam also rejected Solomon’s plea that he reject evil
counsel</u>. Rehoboam’s servants offered wicked advice because they
lacked humility or compassion for the people. They further led Rehoboam
astray by building up his pride and oppressive instincts. Rehoboam
should have heeded Solomon’s advice to reject the counsel of sinners:
“My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.” (Prov. 1:10). “Do not
associate with a man given to anger; or go with a hot-tempered man,”
(Prov. 22:24). “Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness,
but instead even expose them;” (Eph. 5:11). Are you surrounding yourself
with people who give godly advice?</p></li>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam also rejected David’s example of humility</u>.
If he were wise, Rehoboam would have rejected pride and vanity as his
grandfather David did: “A Song of Ascents, of David. O LORD, my heart is
not proud, nor my eyes haughty; nor do I involve myself in great
matters, or in things too difficult for me.” (Ps. 131:1) David also
warned: “And You save an afflicted people; but Your eyes are on the
haughty whom You abase.” (2 Sam. 22:28). “So the common man will be
humbled and the man of importance abased, the eyes of the proud also
will be abased.” (Is. 5:15). Are you looking to glorify yourself or God
through your actions? What advice are you giving others in this
area?</p></li>

Others</u>. 1 Kgs. 12:12-15.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam rejects the cries of his people and threatens
greater oppression</u>. Rehoboam responded to the people’s complaints by
threatening to punish them with labor and tax requirements far worse
than any sacrifice that they had to make under Solomon:
“<sup>12 </sup><em>Then Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on
the third day as the king had directed, saying, ‘Return to me on the
third day.’ <sup>13 </sup>The king answered the people harshly, for he
forsook the advice of the elders which they had given him,
<sup>14 </sup>and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young
men, saying, ‘My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your
yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you
with scorpions.’ <sup>15 </sup>So the king did not listen to the people;
for it was a turn of events from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that He might establish His word, which
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke through Ahijah the
Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat</em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:12-15). Solomon
convinced the people to accept his taxation and service requirements by
wisely creating a shared vision for the Temple and other national
projects. Rehoboam presented no justification for the continued heavy
taxation and service requirements. Because he had no love for the
people, Rehoboam lashed out at them for their requests. As king, he saw
it as his role to make demands of them. Out of cruelty, he further
thought that he needed to teach the people a lesson by imposing even
more severe requirements on them. God used Rehoboam’s foolishness to
fulfill Ahijah’s prophecy (1 Kgs. 11:29-39).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam rejects Solomon’s counsel against stirring up
people with harsh words</u>. Among his many mistakes, Rehoboam ignored
his father’s advice not to stir the people up in anger with harsh words:
“A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.”
(Prov. 15:1). “A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but the slow to anger
calms a dispute.” (Prov. 15:18). “Like charcoal to hot embers and wood
to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife.” (Prov. 26:21). “An
angry man stirs up strife, and a hot-tempered man abounds in
transgression.” (Prov. 29:21). “The poor man utters supplications, but
the rich man answers roughly.” (Prov. 18:23). Believers are also warned
about the evil that can be done through harsh words: “But no one can
tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.” (Jam.
3:8). Church leaders must also be gentle and not quarrelsome in dealing
with others (1 Tim. 3:3). When others disappoint you, do you show love
and control your tongue from hurting them?</p></li>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam violated God’s law by treating the Jews like
Egyptian slaves</u>. Rehoboam also treated the people like an Egyptian
pharaoh by threatening forced labor to punish the people: “The Egyptians
compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously; and they made their
lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of
labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on
them.” (Ex. 1:13-14). God warned His leaders not to place His people
under the same bondage that He had freed them from by delivering them
from Egypt: “For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land
of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. You shall not rule
over him with severity, but are to revere your God.” (Lev. 25:42-43). If
you have others that serve you or look up to you, are you kind and
helpful in lessening their loads?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will punish rulers who use force and violence against
their people</u>. Through Ezekiel, God later promised to punish the
leaders like Rehoboam who mistreated the people with threats of force
instead of helping the people: “Those who are sickly you have not
strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not
bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought
for the lost; but with force and with severity you have dominated them.”
(Ezek. 34:4).</p></li>

<u>A</u> Rebellious <u>Leader is Unforgiving and Sows Division or
Rebellion</u>. 1 Kgs. 12:16-20.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>In response to King Rehoboam’s cruelty, the nation of Israel
was divided into two</u>. Rehoboam’s threats allowed Jeroboam to incite
the northern tribes into killing one of Rehoboam’s servants and then
breaking away to form a separate kingdom: “<sup>16 </sup><em>When all
Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the
king, saying, ‘What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance
in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel! Now look after your own
house, David!’ So Israel departed to their tents. <sup>17 </sup>But as
for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam
reigned over them. <sup>18 </sup>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was
over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death. And King
Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
<sup>19 </sup>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David
to this day. <sup>20 </sup>It came about when all Israel heard that
Jeroboam had returned, that they sent and called him to the assembly and
made him king over all Israel. None but the tribe of Judah followed the
house of David</em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:16-20). By listening to foolish advice,
Rehoboam surrounded himself with wicked men. “If a ruler pays attention
to falsehood, all his ministers become wicked.” (Prov. 29:12). Rehoboam
sent Adoram, the head of forced labor, to negotiate (1 Kgs. 4:6; 5:14).
He apparently shared Rehoboam’s harsh tactics. The people responded by
killing him and revolting against Rehoboam’s rule. Yet, the people also
sinned by failing to pray and showing unforgiveness in their
actions.</p></li>

role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who formant division and rebellion are worthless and act
under Satan’s control</u>. While inciting the people into rebellion,
Jeroboam quoted from a man named Sheba, who previously tried to divide
Israel against David. God called this man “worthless”: “Now a worthless
fellow happened to be there whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a
Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet and said, ‘We have no portion in
David, nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his
tents, O Israel!’” (2 Sam. 20:1). He was also acting under Satan’s
control in inciting rebellion. Satan’s goal has always been to break
down order through rebellion. His goal is to create chaos and misery.
Satan first led a third of the angels in rebellion against God’s rule
(Rev. 12:3-9). He then led Eve to rebel against God’s rules (Gen.
3:1-4). He then lead Adam and Eve to rebel against each other (Gen.
3:16). Satan also becomes the father of those who rebel (Jo. 8:44).
Jesus once quoted a prophesy: “I will strike down the shepherd, and the
sheep shall be scattered.” (Mk. 14:23). When influenced by Satan, the
corrupt “despise authority.” (2 Pet. 2:10). Solomon later said that
rebellion was the sign of an “evil man.” (Prov. 17:11). According to
Paul, rebellion is also part of the spirit of “the prince of the power
of the air.” (Eph. 2:2). Samuel also said that: “. . . rebellion is as
the sin of witchcraft . . .” (1 Sam. 15:23). After leaving Egypt, the
Jews’ lack of faith caused them to repeatedly rebel against God and His
appointed leader Moses (Nu. 14:22). As a result of the Jews’ repeated
refusal to obey and have faith, God eventually banished them to spend 40
years wandering in the desert (Nu. 14:34). For everything good and holy,
Satan has created a counterfeit to deceive people. If God’s perfect
government leads to peace and harmony (1 Tim. 2:1-2), rebellion only
brings strife, death, and misery.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam exploited pre-existing divisions within the tribes to
divide the nation</u>. Tensions between the tribes dated back to Jacob’s
dysfunctional family of 12 boys through four different mothers. Jacob
created jealousy and competition within the tribes when he favored
Joseph and Benjamin over his 10 other sons. These tensions most likely
laid dormant during the tribes’ 400 years of oppression in Egypt. Yet,
these tensions came to the surface when the 12 tribes competed for
influence after they settled in the Promised Land. Pride and coveting
drove the three tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Judah to fight to gain
supremacy. During the time period of the judges, the tribe of Ephraim
tried to assert its dominance over Israel. Jeroboam, as an Ephraimite,
was prideful and felt entitled to power over the tribes for at least
three reasons. First, Joseph, the patriarch of his tribe, had saved the
12 tribes from death by bringing them to Egypt. Jacob then switched the
birth order of Joseph’s two oldest children, Manasseh and Ephraim, to
make the second born Ephraim the firstborn in terms of power and
prestige (Gen. 48:13, 17-20; 41:50-51; Nu. 13:8, 16). Second, Joshua,
the Jews’ leader in their conquest of the Promised Land, was a member of
the Ephraim tribe (Nu. 13:8; 14:6-9). Third, during the time period of
the judges, the tribe of Ephraim guarded the ark in its territory and
hosted all sacrifices and the three yearly festivals for the nation
(Josh. 18:1). In other words, it was the de facto capital of the 12
tribes. Thus, elders from the tribe of Ephraim argued with Gideon from
the tribe of Manasseh out of jealousy after his soldiers defeated the
Midianites without involving Ephraim in the battle (Jdgs. 8:1). The
elders from Ephraim later confronted a judge named Jephthah after he
also failed to consult with them before fighting the Ammonites (Jdgs.
12:1-3). When Saul became Israel’s first king, he also used his power to
place cronies from his tribe of Benjamin in all the positions of power.
When David became a threat, he used the threat of their loss of power to
try to turn the tribe of Benjamin against David (1 Sam. 22:7) After
Saul’s death, Judah was the only tribe to back David because others
wanted to reign supreme (2 Sam. 2:10-11). The tribes then fought a civil
war for seven years to determine who should lead (2 Sam. 2:12-4:12).
David’s victory gave the tribe of Judah control of Israel for 80 years.
David reigned for 40 years (1 Kgs. 2:11), and Solomon reigned for 40
years (1 Kgs. 11:42). As an Ephraimite, Jeroboam believed that Judah’s
80-year claim to leading Israel was nothing next to the hundreds of
years in which his tribe had led the 12 tribes. Yet, his mistake was
ignoring that it was God’s right to pick who would lead next.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The people ignored Solomon’s advice to be calm when they
disagreed with a ruler</u>. Instead of listening to Jeroboam’s calls for
rebellion, the people should have listened to Solomon’s advice to be
patient when faced with a ruler who offends: “If the ruler’s temper
rises against you, do not abandon your position, because composure
allays great offenses. There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like
an error which goes forth from the ruler--” (Ecc. 10:4-5). “By
forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the
bone.” (Prov. 25:15). Are you patient with leaders you disagree
with?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unite others in the Body of Christ</u>. Unlike Jeroboam,
believers are called upon to act with one accord as the Spirit leads the
body. “so we, who are many, <em>are one body in Christ</em>, and
individually members one of another.” (Ro. 12:5). “Since there is one
bread, we who are many are <em>one body</em>; for we all partake of the
one bread.” (1 Cor. 10:17). “For even as the body is one and yet has
many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are
<em>one body</em>, so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12). “But now there
are many members, but <em>one body</em>. And the eye cannot say to the
hand, ‘I have no need of you’; or again the head to the feet, ‘I have no
need of you.’” (1 Cor. 12:20-21). “There is <em>one body</em> and one
Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;” (Eph.
4:4). You must also be motivated by love when you act with others:
“Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of
unity.” (Col. 3:14). Jeroboam did not act with love. Do your actions
divide others for your glory?</p></li>

from coming true by using of his army to brutally impose his will:
“<sup>21 </sup><em>Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled

kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <sup>22 </sup>But the word of
God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <sup>23 </sup>‘Speak to
Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of
Judah and Benjamin and to the rest of the people, saying,
<sup>24 </sup>‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘You
must not go up and fight against your relatives the sons of Israel;
return every man to his house, for this thing has come from Me.’’’ So
they listened to the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
and returned and went their way according to the word of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:21-24). In response to
his pride, God reduced Rehoboam’s nation from 12 mighty tribes to just
two. His kingdom would be limited to the territories of Judah and
Benjamin, the two southern tribes (2 Chron. 11:3; 14:8). Simeon was
previously given land in the southern section of Judah’s territory
(Josh. 19:1-9). And the tribe of Benjamin was split between the two
kingdoms. Elsewhere, we are told that Simeon also rejected Rehoboam and
went north to join with the northern tribes (1 Chron. 12:23-25; 2 Chron.
15:9; 34:6). Thus, through his arrogance, Rehoboam lost 10 tribes. In
birth order, these included: (1) Reuben, (2) Simeon, (3) Zebulun, (4)
Issachar, (5) Dan, (6) Gad, (7) Asher, (8) Naphtali, (9) Manasseh, and
(10) Ephraim. The tribe of Levi was originally scattered throughout all
the lands to serve everyone (Josh. 21:1-42). Yet, Jeroboam refused to
use them as priests. Thus, they soon migrated to Judah after Israel was
divided (2 Chron. 11:13-16).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>King Rehoboam could not use force to overcome God’s judgment
upon Israel</u>. Rehoboam failed in his efforts to use his army to
suppress the rebels. God had previously told Solomon that he would tear
his kingdom from him and give it to one of his servants: “So the LORD
said to Solomon, ‘Because you have done this, and you have not kept My
covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear
the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.” (1 Kgs. 11:11.)
Solomon did not repent. Thus, through the prophet Ahijah, God then told
Solomon’s servant Jeroboam that He would give him control over 10 of the
12 tribes of Israel: “but I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand
and give it to you, even ten tribes.” (1 Kgs. 11:35). Yet, to keep God’s
promise to David, God promised that this would not happen until after
Solomon’s death: “Nevertheless I will not do it in your days for the
sake of your father David, but I will tear it out of the hand of your
son.” (1 Kgs. 11:12). Even if Rehoboam did not know God’s Word, his High
Priest likely warned him about God’s prophecy. God might have delayed
His judgment if Rehoboam had led the nation in repentance and removed
all of the idolatrous temples that Solomon built for his foreign wives.
Rehoboam instead foolishly thought that he could prevent God’s Word from
coming true through force. In the end, God’s prophet Shemaiah convinced
Rehoboam and his troops to back down.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Saul and Solomon also foolishly tried to use force to keep
God’s Word from coming true</u>. King Rehoboam was not the first to
think he could use force to prevent God’s Word from coming true. Saul
tried to kill David to prevent the prophecy of David becoming king from
coming true (e.g., 1 Sam. 19:1, 9). Having been told of the prophecy
that Jeroboam would divide his great kingdom, Solomon also tried to
prevent God’s prophecy from coming true by trying to kill him (1 Kgs.
11:40). God’s Word always comes true: “The LORD of hosts has sworn
saying, ‘Surely, just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as
I have planned so it will stand,”’ (Is. 14:24). Yet, He may delay His
judgment or forgive when the people repent (Ezek. 12:25). The Church
knows what will happen in the end times. Thus, it should promote church
and civil leaders who preach repentance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon lamented that he labored in vain for a kingdom his son
would soon destroy</u>. Knowing God’s prophecy, Solomon lamented that he
labored to build up a mighty kingdom in vain. God would soon wash it
away like a sand castle when his son took power: “Thus I hated all the
fruit of my labor for which I had labored under the sun, for I must
leave it to the man who will come after me. And who knows whether he
will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the
fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the
sun. This too is vanity.” (Ecc. 2:18-19).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>King Jeroboam becomes King of Israel, and immediately embraces
idolatry</u>. Even though God gave Jeroboam the chance to lead the 10
tribes of northern Israel, Jeroboam created fake golden calf idols and
worship centers to keep the Jews from worshiping God in His Temple in
Jerusalem: “<sup>25 </sup><em>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill
country of Ephraim, and lived there. And he went out from there and
built Penuel. <sup>26 </sup>Jeroboam said in his heart, ‘Now the kingdom
will return to the house of David. <sup>27 </sup>If this people go up to
offer sacrifices in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will return to their lord,
even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me and return to
Rehoboam king of Judah.’ <sup>28 </sup>So the king consulted, and made
two golden calves, and he said to them, ‘It is too much for you to go up
to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the
land of Egypt.’ <sup>29 </sup>He set one in Bethel, and the other he put
in Dan. <sup>30 </sup>Now this thing became a sin, for the people went
to worship before the one as far as Dan</em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:25-30).
Jeroboam is infamous in the Bible because he led an entire nation into
idolatry all out of a misplaced belief that he needed to do this to
preserve his power: “When He had torn Israel from the house of David,
they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel
away from following the LORD and made them commit a great sin.” (2 Kgs.
17:21). He also took steps to prevent people from being able to travel
to Judah. He further fortified Shechem, the northern capital (1 Kgs.
12:25). He also built up Penuel east of the River Jordan to assert his
control over the Jewish territories in modern day Jordan. Thus, he began
a process of spiritual decline that would culminate in Israel’s exile to
Assyria (2 Kings 17:20-23).</p></li>

<p>Jeroboam instituted idol worship in his kingdom<a href="#fn6"
id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Jeroboam ignored God’s warnings against idols and
worshiping golden calves</u>. God’s Second Commandment expressly
prohibited the Jews from using idols to worship Him or any other alleged
deity: “You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what
is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the
earth. You shall not worship them or serve them; . . ..” (Ex. 20:4-6;
Dt. 5:8-10). King Jeroboam not only violated the Second Commandment, he
did so in the exact same way that God condemned when Aaron built the
golden calf and said that it represented God: “They have quickly turned
aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves
a molten calf, and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said,
‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of
Egypt!’” (Ex. 32:8, 4; Dt. 9:12). Jeroboam had just returned to Israel
after years of exile in Egypt. Pharaoh had even given him a
sister-in-law as a pagan wife (1 Kgs 11:19-20). Like Solomon, Jeroboam’s
pagan wife led his heart astray. He incorporated the Egyptian belief
that a person must see a god to worship it. Yet, God expressly
prohibited this form of worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>King Jeroboam also ignored God’s warnings to let Him pick His
place of worship</u>. At the southern end of his kingdom, Jeroboam put
one false center of worship in Beth-el, 11 miles north of Jerusalem in
the divided territory of Benjamin (1 Kgs. 12:29; Josh. 18:11-13, 22). He
was most likely able to manipulate the Jews into believing that this was
a proper worship location because Jacob worshiped there (Gen. 28:10-22;
35:1-15). At the northern end of his kingdom, he put a worship center in
the city of Dan, located today in southern Lebanon (1 Kgs. 1:29). He
most likely picked this as a second location because the rebellious Jews
previously created a pagan worship center there during the time period
of the Judges (Jdgs. 18:30-31). Although Jerusalem thought that his
actions were politically astute, God warned the Jews through Moses that
they could only worship in the appointed place that He selected: “But
you shall seek the LORD <em>at the place which the LORD your God will
choose</em> from all your tribes, to establish His name there for His
dwelling, and there you shall come . . . then it shall come about that
the place in which the LORD your God will choose for His name to dwell,
there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and
your sacrifices, your tithes and the contribution of your hand, and all
your choice votive offerings which you will vow to the LORD.” (Dt. 12:5,
11). The Jews could not do this in any cultic place that they found.
Offerings could only be made in the place that God selected: “Be careful
that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every cultic place you
see, but in the place which the LORD chooses in one of your tribes,
there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all
that I command you.” (Dt. 12:13-14). Thus, Jeroboam’s acts were
offensive to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>By embracing idolatry, King Jeroboam squandered his God-given
chance to succeed</u>. Although Jeroboam was an evil man, God gave the
10 northern tribes the same conditional promise to succeed that He gave
to Solomon. If they kept His Commandments and statutes, they would
succeed as a nation (1 Kgs. 2:3-4; 3:14; 11:38). Sadly, Jeroboam and
every future leader of northern Israel was evil and rejected God’s laws.
Thus, God previously revealed that northern Israel would not last
forever (1 Kgs. 11:39). The house of David would ultimately rule over
all 12 tribes (Ezek. 37:15-28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Idolatry puts a believer in communion with demons</u>. An idol
is any physical thing to which you devote yourself. Although idols like
money have no real power by themselves, the unbridled desire for these
things causes addiction and puts a person in communion with demonic
forces: “What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is
anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things
which the Gentiles sacrifice, <em>they sacrifice to demons</em> and not
to God; and I do not want you to become <em>sharers in demons</em>.” (1
Cor. 10:19-20). God will never leave or forsake a believer (Heb. 13:5;
Dt. 31:6). Yet, God cannot stop you if you choose to give into an
addiction by listening to the demons over the Holy Spirit. Ask yourself
what you desire most. If your answer is something material or the flesh,
you are listening to the counsel of demons.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Idolatrous rulers may stumble and pull believers off of their
walks</u>. Paul warned that merely associating with an idolater (i.e.,
someone trapped with an addiction) can cause the believer to be pulled
off his or her walk. “But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with
any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, <em>or an
idolater</em>, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler-- not even to
eat with such a one.” (1 Cor. 5:11). “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company
corrupts good morals.’” (1 Cor. 15:3). You can also cause others to
stumble in your walk through your own idolatry. You must: “take care
that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to
the weak.” (1 Cor. 8:9). If merely associating with an idolater can
cause you to stumble, the risk is even greater when your leader is an
idolater. That person can cause any person or group of people under his
or her authority to be led astray by his or her bad example.</p></li>

<u>A</u> Rebellious <u>Leader Does Not Fear God and Embraces Satan’s
Counterfeit</u>. 1 Kgs. 12:31-33</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>King Jeroboam cemented his reign with a counterfeit priesthood
and counterfeit worship</u>. In addition to creating idols and
unauthorized worship centers, Jeroboam created a counterfeit priesthood
and religious practices to keep the Jews away from God’s Temple:
“<sup>31 </sup><em>And he made houses on high places, and made priests
from among all the people who were not of the sons of Levi.
<sup>32 </sup>Jeroboam instituted a feast in the eighth month on the
fifteenth day of the month, like the feast which is in Judah, and he
went up to the altar; thus he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves
which he had made. And he stationed in Bethel the priests of the high
places which he had made. <sup>33 </sup>Then he went up to the altar
which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month,
even in the month which he had devised in his own heart; and he
instituted a feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to
burn incense</em>.” (1 Kgs. 12:31-33). Jeroboam’s idolatry and his two
unauthorized worship centers caused the Levite priests to flee southward
into Judah along with other true believers (2 Chron. 11:13-17). Jeroboam
responded by creating an unauthorized priesthood that was not from the
tribe of Levi (1 Kgs. 12:31). He also created his own festival to
replace the Feast of Tabernacles. There, his counterfeit priests
sacrificed calves associated with the Canaanite gods El and Baal (1 Kgs.
12:32-33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam’s non-Levite priesthood violated God’s law</u>. In
addition to his idolatry and unauthorized worship centers, Jeroboam
violated God’s law by appointing a non-Levite priesthood to carry out
his counterfeit religion. God repeatedly stated that only the Levites
could be priests under the Mosaic law: “So you shall appoint Aaron and
his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the layman who comes
near shall be put to death.” (Nu. 3:10). “You shall put them on Aaron
your brother and on his sons with him; and you shall anoint them and
ordain them and consecrate them, that they may serve Me as priests.”
(Ex. 28:41). “You shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and
bind caps on them, and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual
statute. So you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.” (Ex. 29:9). Thus, with
each step into rebellion against God, Jeroboam took further steps into
evil for both himself and all of the 10 northern tribes.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam’s unauthorized feasts also violated God’s law</u>.
Among other festivals, God previously required the Jews to observe the
Feast of Booths / Tabernacles / Sukkot during the seventh month, Tisri,
at the Temple in Jerusalem (Ex. 34:22-23; Lev. 23:33-36, 39-40).
Jeroboam changed God’s Word by holding this festival on the eighth
month, Marcheshvan, and in the non-authorized location in Beth-el (1
Kgs. 11:32).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam’s unauthorized sacrifices also violated God’s
law</u>. Jeroboam also performed the sacrifices himself (1 Kgs. 12:33).
This also violated God’s law, which separated the roles of the priests
and civil leaders to prevent the consolidation of power. Through the
Levite priests, God later condemned King Uzziah of Judah when he tried
to do the same thing: “They opposed Uzziah the king and said to him, ‘It
is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the
priests, the sons of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out
of the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful and will have no honor
from the LORD God.”’ (2 Chr. 26:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam’s unauthorized religion was an abomination to
God</u>. If the people had read Solomon’s proverbs, they would have
known that God would not listen to their prayers through their
counterfeit religion: “He who turns away his ear from listening to the
law, even his prayer is an abomination.” (Prov. 28:9). Thus, they prayed
in vain.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jeroboam’s unauthorized religion led to the death of his
nation</u>. Solomon warned: “There is a way which seems right to a man,
but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12; 16:25). The northern
tribes’ decision to live outside of God’s plan ultimately led to their
extinction as a nation. As part of the Second Commandment, God warns
that He will punish both idolaters and their descendants (Ex. 20:3-6;
Dt. 5:7-10). Idolaters are also cursed (Dt. 27:15). An idolater who has
not repented and accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior is not only cursed to
struggle and lead a life of desperation, that person is also
disqualified from entering heaven (Ex. 22:20; Dt. 13:6, 10; 1 Cor.
6:9-10). “For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure
person or covetous man, <em>who is an idolater</em>, has an inheritance
in the kingdom of Christ and God.” (Eph. 5:5; Rev. 2:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will punish people who lead His people astray</u>. Leaders
like Jeroboam are also subject to even greater punishment when they lead
others astray: ‘“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering
the sheep of My pasture!’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 23:1; 12:10; 50:6).
Thus, if you are a leader, be careful to teach all of God’s Word and not
to alter it to fit your personal beliefs. Teach others to serve God as
He commands.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be wary of false leaders who don’t fear God and refuse to
follow God’s Word</u>. Throughout history, there have been many false
leaders who have led God’s people into rebellion against His Word. Many
twist God’s Word to start counterfeit religions: “Beware of the false
prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous
wolves.” (Matt. 7:15). “Many false prophets will arise and will mislead
many.” (Matt. 24:11, 24). Thus, you must test every person who seeks to
guide you on your walk with Christ: “Beloved, do not believe every
spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because
many false prophets have gone out into the world.” (1 Jo. 4:1; 1 Thess.
5:21). A common false doctrine today is the rejection of the Ten
Commandments as God’s standard of morality. Jesus was the “I AM” who
gave the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Horeb (Ex. 3:14; Jo. 8:58).
He wants you to keep His Commandments out of love, not obligation: “If
you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” (Jo. 14:15; 21). Rejecting
the Ten Commandments as a standard for moral conduct will not cause you
to lose your salvation as a believer. Yet, living outside the
protections of the Ten Commandments places you outside of God’s
protections and His blessings. If you reject the protections of the Ten
Commandments, you reject His shield from the evil one (Prov. 30:5). You
will be unprotected from the devil’s fiery darts and temptations (Eph.
6:10). A church leader who refuses to teach on the Ten Commandments or a
civil leader who refuses to follow them can also lead people
astray.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Satan seeks to place you into bondage to the idols of the
world and sin</u>. Satan’s ultimate goal is to place you into bondage
and, like he did to Jeroboam, cause you to turn away from God. God warns
against turning your job, things that you create, or other things of the
world into idols (Ps. 135:15; same 115:4). Drugs, alcohol, money, power,
prestige, gambling, and things of the flesh can also become idols in
your life: “Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead
to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, <em>which
amounts to idolatry</em>.” (Col. 3:5). Satan seeks to put your flesh at
war with God’s Spirit: “[T]he mind set on the flesh is hostile toward
God . . .” (Rom. 8:7). “and those who are in the flesh <em>cannot</em>
please God.” (Rom. 8:8; Gal. 5:19; 1 Tim. 1:10). If you are not careful,
the devil will ultimately enslave you (Ro. 6:16; Gal. 4:7-9). If you
then fail to ask for Christ to deliver you from your bondage, He may
turn you over to your addictions until you repent (Ro. 1:24-33; Ps.
81:12). Thus, you must pick that which you will serve (Matt. 6:24). Are
you trying to serve both Jesus and yourself?</p></li>
