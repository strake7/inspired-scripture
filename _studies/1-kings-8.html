Kings 8: Lessons from Solomon’s Dedication of the Temple on Spirit-Led
Worship</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter tells about the dedication of the
Temple. After the dedication of the Temple, God’s presence returned to
dwell with Israel (1 Kgs. 8:11; 2 Chr. 7:1). This was the peak of the
nation of Israel’s history before Jesus. Exactly fifteen generations
passed between Abraham and Solomon. At this moment, Israel reached its
full glory as God’s presence served as a light to the nations. Yet,
fourteen sad generations of spiritual decline then passed until the last
Jewish king Zedekiah. Jesus, the true light of the world, came exactly
15 generations after Solomon (Matt. 1:17). Prior to Jesus’ arrival, the
Temple was meant to spread God’s light amongst God’s people and
throughout the world. It was also the central place for the Jews to
worship Him and find fellowship with Him. From Solomon’s dedication, God
reveals seven lessons on true Spirit-led worship. Spirit-led worship is:
(1) centered on God’s Word; (2) praises His faithfulness; (3) humbly
praises His greatness; (4) seeks His forgiveness; (5) seeks the strength
to obey Him; (6) praises Jesus’ atoning sacrifice; and (7) celebrates
your God-given joy.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon began the dedication process for the Temple,
the center of all worship, by bringing the Ark of the Covenant inside.
The Ark housed the Ten Commandments. From this, God reveals that
Spirit-led worship is centered around God’s Word and His Commandments.
<u>Second</u>, Solomon next celebrated God for His faithfulness in
bringing the Jews out of Egypt to the Promised Land and in establishing
an eternal dynasty through King David. God wants you to know that you
can also trust His promises. In recognition of this, Spirit-led worship
should praise God’s faithfulness. <u>Third</u>, Solomon’s dedication
included humble praise for God’s unique greatness and power. Solomon
humbled himself before all of Israel to demonstrate in humility that
there is none like God. Spirit-led worship also approaches God in
humility and praises God’s unique and amazing character. <u>Fourth</u>,
the longest part of Solomon’s dedication included an acknowledgement of
the Jews’ sins and a request for God to show mercy and grace with Him.
From his example, God reveals that Spirit-led worship praises God for
His forgiveness and His mercy and grace. <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon sought
out the strength to be obedient. From his example, God reveals that
Spirit-led worship seeks the strength to be obedient. <u>Sixth</u>,
Solomon’s dedication of the Temple included the sacrifice of many
animals to atone for the Jews’ sins. Jesus fulfilled the need for
further animal sacrifices with His death. In response, Spirit-led
worship should praise Him for the atonement of your sins.
<u>Finally</u>, Solomon’s dedication concluded with a joyful celebration
during the feast of Tabernacles. Today, Spirit-led worship should also
praise God for the joy that comes from Him and by living a life filled
with His joy as a light for others to see.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Ark is brought into the Temple</u>. Solomon’s dedication
process began with the most important item in the Temple, the Ark of the
Covenant: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel
and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers’ households
of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark
of the covenant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from the city
of David, which is Zion. <sup>2 </sup>All the men of Israel assembled
themselves to King Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is
the seventh month. <sup>3 </sup>Then all the elders of Israel came, and
the priests took up the ark. <sup>4 </sup>They brought up the ark of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and the tent of meeting and all the
holy utensils, which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites
brought them up. <sup>5 </sup>And King Solomon and all the congregation
of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark,
sacrificing so many sheep and oxen they could not be counted or
numbered. <sup>6 </sup>Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to its place, into the inner
sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the
cherubim. <sup>7 </sup>For the cherubim spread their wings over the
place of the ark, and the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its
poles from above. <sup>8 </sup>But the poles were so long that the ends
of the poles could be seen from the holy place before the inner
sanctuary, but they could not be seen outside; they are there to this
day. <sup>9 </sup>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of
stone which Moses put there at Horeb, where the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> made a covenant with the sons of Israel,
when they came out of the land of Egypt. <sup>10 </sup>It happened that
when the priests came from the holy place, the cloud filled the house of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, <sup>11 </sup>so that the
priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (1 Kgs. 8:1-11). Solomon assembled
the elders of Israel (1 Kgs. 8:1) during the “feast” during the seventh
month of Ethanim (1 Kgs. 8:2). This would have correlated with the Feast
of Tabernacles /Booths or <em>Sukkot</em> (Lev. 23:33-43). Solomon
finished the Temple during the eighth month (1 Kgs. 6:38). Yet, because
of the important connection between Sukkot and the dedication of the
Temple, Solomon had to wait 11 months until the seventh month of the
following year to dedicate the Temple. <em>Sukkot</em> was one of three
times during the year when the people would have made a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem for worship (Dt. 16:16). More importantly, it marked the
celebration when God dwelled with the Jews in the wilderness. The
dedication also took place during a Jubilee year, when God restored what
the people had lost due to sin (Lev. 23:33-36, 39-43; Dt. 16:13-15). The
entry of the Ark into the Temple would have happened on the first day of
the eight-day festival. To avoid the mistake that Uzziah made when he
died after touching the Ark while transporting it on a cart (2 Sam.
6:1-7), Solomon had the priests properly carry the Ark using poles on
both sides (Nu. 7:9; 1 Kgs. 8:6). Inside the Ark were the tables of
stone with the Ten Commandments (1 Kgs. 8:9). The Commandments
established the First Covenant (Dt. 9:9; 10:1-5, 8). Yet, the jar of
manna (Ex. 16:33) and Aaron’s budding rod were no longer in the Ark (Nu.
17:10; Heb. 9:4). These things may have been lost when Philistines
captured the Ark (1 Sam. 4:11). The Philistines likely looked at the
tablets of stone and considered them to be worthless. In some ways, many
believers also consider God’s Ten Commandments to be worthless.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Spirit-led worship cannot happen without God’s Word at its
center</u>. Worship that is not true to God’s Word and His Commandments
is an abomination to Him: “As we have said before, so I say again now,
if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received,
he is to be accursed!” (Gal. 1:9). “Do not be carried away by varied and
strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by
grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not
benefited.” (Heb. 13:9). Although Jesus is the only means to salvation,
many ignore the importance of the Ten Commandments as His standard of
morality. Jesus is the “I AM” who gave Moses the Ten Commandments (Jo.
8:58; Ex. 3:14). When you break His Commandments, you are showing
neither love nor appreciation for what Jesus did for you: “If you love
Me, you will keep My commandments.” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2
Jo. 1:6). Thus, Spirit-led worship should be centered on Jesus’
Commandments and His Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s cloud spoke to His presence amongst His people
throughout history</u>. The first thing that the Jews observed was that
“<em>the cloud filled the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>” (1 Kgs. 8:10). As one commentator
observes, this was the sign of Yahweh, who had been with the Jews since
He freed them from bondage in Egypt: · This is the cloud that stood by
Israel in the wilderness (Exodus 13:21-22). · This is the cloud of glory
that God spoke to Israel from (Exodus 16:10). · This is the cloud from
which God met with Moses and others (Exodus 19:9, 24:15-18, Numbers
11:25, 12:5, 16:42). · This is the cloud that stood by the door of the
Tabernacle (Exodus 33:9-10). · This is the cloud from which God appeared
to the High Priest in the Holy Place inside the veil (Leviticus 16:2). ·
This is the cloud of Ezekiel’s vision, filling the temple of God with
the brightness of His glory (Ezekiel 10:4). · This is the cloud of glory
that overshadowed Mary when she conceived Jesus by the power of the Holy
Spirit (Luke 1:35). · This is the cloud present at the transfiguration
of Jesus (Luke 9:34-35). · This is the cloud of glory that received
Jesus into heaven at His ascension (Acts 1:9). · This is the cloud that
will display the glory of Jesus Christ when He returns in triumph to
this earth (Luke 21:27, Revelation 1:7). There is a parallel to this
event in Acts 2:1-4 in which God marks the inception of the church as
the temple of the Holy Spirit by making his presence known through the
sound of a mighty rushing wind and by filling those present with the
Holy Spirit.” (David Guzik on 1 Kgs. 8).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"
class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> His cloud today
is now part of the Holy Spirit inside of you (Jo. 14:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The glory of God filled the Temple</u>. After Solomon brought
the Ark into the Temple, “<em>the glory of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (1 Kgs. 8:11). His glory was so
bright that the priests could not stand to minister (1 Kgs. 8:11). His
Shekinah glory previously came and entered the Tabernacle after Moses
dedicated it (Ex. 40:34-35). Yet, sin would later cause God’s Shekinah
glory to leave Israel (Ezek. 10:18-19). His glory, however, returned
again with Jesus (Jo. 1:1, 14). His Shekinah glory will return again to
the rebuilt Temple during the Millennial Reign (Ezek. 43:1-5). Believers
will then be able to experience His Shekinah glory throughout all
eternity (Rev. 21:2-3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can experience part of God’s glory through the Holy
Spirit</u>. Through the Holy Spirit, Jesus allows believers to
experience part of His glory: “The glory which You have given Me I have
given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;” (Jo. 17:22).
Today, God’s Holy Spirit dwells within you (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; 2 Cor.
6:16; Eph. 2:22; Heb. 3:6; Rom. 13:14; 2 Tim. 1:14). Whenever two or
more are gathered in His name, His presence is also there: “For where
two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their
midst.” (Matt. 18:20). Thus, a believer must therefore not forsake the
fellowship of other believers (Heb. 10:25). Are you also making yourself
accountable and growing in a small group? Are you also keeping the
temple of the Holy Spirit holy by renewing your mind and staying pure?
(Rom. 12:1-2; Jam. 1:27).</p></li>

<u>God’s Faithfulness: Spirit-Led Worship Praises God’s
Faithfulness</u>. 1 Kgs. 8:12-21.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon praises God’s faithfulness</u>. Solomon’s dedication
speech began with his praise for God’s faithfulness in delivering Israel
and in establishing an eternal dynasty through David:
“<sup>12 </sup><em>Then Solomon said, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has said that He would dwell in the thick
cloud. <sup>13 </sup>‘I have surely built You a lofty house, a place for
Your dwelling forever.’’” <sup>14 </sup>Then the king faced about and
blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was
standing. <sup>15 </sup>He said, ‘Blessed be the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who spoke with His
mouth to my father David and has fulfilled it with His hand, saying,
<sup>16 </sup>‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt,
I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to
build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be over
My people Israel.’ <sup>17 </sup>Now it was in the heart of my father
David to build a house for the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <sup>18 </sup>But the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘Because it
was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was
in your heart. <sup>19 </sup>Nevertheless you shall not build the house,
but your son who will be born to you, he will build the house for My
name.’ <sup>20 </sup>Now the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
fulfilled His word which He spoke; for I have risen in place of my
father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> promised, and have built the house for the
name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.
<sup>21 </sup>There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the
covenant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, which He made with
our fathers when He brought them from the land of Egypt</em>.” (1 Kgs.
8:12-21; 2 Chron. 6:1-11). Solomon began by recognizing God’s grace that
He would bless the Jews by occupying a land of darkness (1 Kgs. 8:12).
Solomon then expressed his hope that God would occupy the dwelling and
live with His people forever (1 Kgs. 8:13). Although the building that
Solomon dedicated would later be destroyed, God will honor this request
with a similar Temple in heaven where He will dwell with His people
forever (Rev. 21:2-3). Solomon then addressed the people of Israel (1
Kgs. 8:14). His words repeated many of the themes that Nathan gave to
David when God formed His Covenant through David (2 Sam. 7:12-16).
Solomon celebrated God’s faithfulness in bringing the Jews out of
captivity in Egypt and His sacrifice in waiting until the Promised Land
was secure before building a house for Him (1 Kgs. 8:16). Solomon then
celebrated God’s faithfulness in fulfilling His promise that a son of
David would build the Temple (1 Kgs. 8:19-20; 2 Sam. 7:20-21). Solomon
then returned to the Ark and what it represented. It represented both
God’s promise of His Covenant with His faithfulness to deliver His
people, just as He did in Egypt (1 Kgs. 8:21).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He is faithful even when you are not</u>.
Solomon did not deserve to receive God’s covenant. He violated many of
God’s laws. Yet, God remained faithful, even when Solomon was not. He
will also remain faithful to you when your faith fails you: “If we are
faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim.
2:13). Are you singing God’s praises for remaining faithful to you when
you are not?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God to non-believers around you</u>. Like Solomon,
David promised to go “among the nations” and “sing praises to Your
name.” (2 Sam. 22:50). Also like Solomon, David knew that God’s
victories were for His glory so that other nations would also bow down
in reverence to the true King of Kings. Paul later quoted David to state
that he would also proclaim Jesus to the nations: “ . . . as it is
written, ‘Therefore I will give praise to you among the gentiles, and I
will sing your name.” (Ro. 15:9). In response to Jesus’ faithfulness,
will you also praise Him to non-believers (Matt. 28:16-20)?</p></li>

<u>God’s Greatness: Spirit-Led Worship Praises God in Humility</u>. 1
Kgs. 8:22-27.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon’s humility in praising God</u>. At the altar, Solomon
then offered a humble prayer of dedication that began by praising God
for His lovingkindness and His unique qualities: “<sup>22 </sup><em>Then
Solomon stood before the altar of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the presence of all the assembly of
Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven. <sup>23 </sup>He said, ‘O
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, there is no God
like You in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and
showing lovingkindness to Your servants who walk before You with all
their heart, <sup>24 </sup>who have kept with Your servant, my father
David, that which You have promised him; indeed, You have spoken with
Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand as it is this day.
<sup>25 </sup>Now therefore, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
God of Israel, keep with Your servant David my father that which You
have promised him, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the
throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way to walk
before Me as you have walked.’ <sup>26 </sup>Now therefore, O God of
Israel, let Your word, I pray, be confirmed which You have spoken to
Your servant, my father David</em>. <sup>27 <em>‘</em></sup><em>But will
God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven
cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built!</em>”
(1 Kgs. 8:22-27). Solomon raised up his hands in a statement of humility
and submission before all of Israel (1 Kgs. 8:22). He was also kneeling
as he prayed (1 Kgs. 8:54). Unlike the Egyptian kings who considered
themselves to be gods, Solomon was publicly demonstrating to all the
people that he was nothing like their magnificent Creator. Because the
Jews had repeatedly followed after false gods, Solomon then reminded the
people that no one could compare to God in His greatness, His
omnipresence, and His faithfulness (1 Kgs. 8:23-24). Part of what made
God unique was His loving kindness towards His people (1 Kgs. 8:23).
Just as Jesus did in His model prayer, Spirit-led worship should pay
tribute to God’s greatness (Matt. 6:9). Just as his father David had
done when he received God’s Covenant, Solomon then prayed in humility
for God to confirm His Covenant through Solomon (1 Kgs. 8:25-26).
Solomon did not speak to God out of a sense of entitlement or pride.
Solomon concluded this portion of his dedicatory prayer by recognizing
that the Temple was not like the pagan temples where their gods
physically resided. God’s presence was in the Temple. Yet, the heavens
and the Earth could not fully contain His amazing presence (1 Kgs.
8:27). He exists outside of space and time as the Creator of the
universe and everything within it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God exalted Solomon as king because he was a humble
servant</u>. Because Solomon was humble in his words, his beliefs, and
in his service as king, God rewarded him by exalting him to become a
great King of Israel. God promises to resist those who are prideful and
exalt those who are humble. “A man’s pride will bring him low, but a
humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “Humble yourselves in
the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:10). “For
everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself
will be exalted.” (Lk. 14:11). “Therefore humble yourselves under the
mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,” (1 Pet.
5:6). If you are humble in your walk, God will bless you by exalting you
in heaven.</p></li>

<u>God’s Forgiveness: Spirit-Led Worship Praises God’s Forgiveness</u>.
1 Kgs. 8:28-53.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon’s praise for God’s mercy and forgiveness</u>. The
longest part of Solomon’s prayer recognized mankind’s inherent sin and
God’s need to judge sin as a just and righteous God. Recognizing their
need for God’s mercy, Solomon prayed that God would forgive the Jews’
sins: “<em><sup>28 </sup>Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant
and to his supplication, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God,
to listen to the cry and to the prayer which Your servant prays before
You today; <sup>29 </sup>that Your eyes may be open toward this house
night and day, toward the place of which You have said, ‘My name shall
be there,’ to listen to the prayer which Your servant shall pray toward
this place. <sup>30 </sup>Listen to the supplication of Your servant and
of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place; hear in heaven
Your dwelling place; hear and forgive. <sup>31 </sup>“If a man sins
against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and he comes and takes
an oath before Your altar in this house, <sup>32 </sup>then hear in
heaven and act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked by
bringing his way on his own head and justifying the righteous by giving
him according to his righteousness. <sup>33 </sup>“When Your people
Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against
You, if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray and make
supplication to You in this house, <sup>34 </sup>then hear in heaven,
and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the
land which You gave to their fathers. <sup>35 </sup>“When the heavens
are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You,
and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from
their sin when You afflict them, <sup>36 </sup>then hear in heaven and
forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, indeed,
teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your
land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance.
<sup>37 </sup>“If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence,
if there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper, if their enemy
besieges them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever
sickness there is, <sup>38 </sup>whatever prayer or supplication is made
by any man or by all Your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of
his own heart, and spreading his hands toward this house;
<sup>39 </sup>then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive and
act and render to each according to all his ways, whose heart You know,
for You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men, <sup>40 </sup>that
they may fear You all the days that they live in the land which You have
given to our fathers. <sup>41 </sup>“Also concerning the foreigner who
is not of Your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for Your
name’s sake <sup>42 </sup>(for they will hear of Your great name and
Your mighty hand, and of Your outstretched arm); when he comes and prays
toward this house, <sup>43 </sup>hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and
do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, in order that
all the peoples of the earth may know Your name, to fear You, as do Your
people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built
is called by Your name. <sup>44 </sup>“When Your people go out to battle
against their enemy, by whatever way You shall send them, and they pray
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> toward the city which You
have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,
<sup>45 </sup>then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
and maintain their cause. <sup>46 </sup>“When they sin against You (for
there is no man who does not sin) and You are angry with them and
deliver them to an enemy, so that they take them away captive to the
land of the enemy, far off or near; <sup>47 </sup>if they take thought
in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and make
supplication to You in the land of those who have taken them captive,
saying, ‘We have sinned and have committed iniquity, we have acted
wickedly’; <sup>48 </sup>if they return to You with all their heart and
with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them
captive, and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their
fathers, the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have
built for Your name; <sup>49 </sup>then hear their prayer and their
supplication in heaven Your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
<sup>50 </sup>and forgive Your people who have sinned against You and
all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You, and
make them objects of compassion before those who have taken them
captive, that they may have compassion on them <sup>51 </sup>(for they
are Your people and Your inheritance which You have brought forth from
Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace), <sup>52 </sup>that Your eyes
may be open to the supplication of Your servant and to the supplication
of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call to You.
<sup>53 </sup>For You have separated them from all the peoples of the
earth as Your inheritance, as You spoke through Moses Your servant, when
You brought our fathers forth from Egypt, O Lord <span
class="smallcaps">God</span></em>.” (1 Kgs. 8:28-53). Also from a
position of humility, Solomon recognized how amazing it was that the
Creator of the universe would hear the prayers of sinful people (1 Kgs.
8:28). Solomon then cried out as an intercessor for God to hear the
prayers of His people and forgive them their sins ( Kgs. 8:30). Knowing
that God promised 40 progressively severe curses for a nation in open
sin and rebellion (Dt. 28:15-68), Solomon prayed that God would overlook
past and future sins that would normally cause God to withhold His
blessing and discipline the nation. He then listed seven prayers for
which he pleaded for God to hear and respond to their future prayers (1
Kgs. 8:31-54). <u>First</u>, Solomon prayed that God would provide the
wisdom for mankind to judge between the wicked and the righteous (1 Kgs.
8:31-32). <u>Second</u>, he prayed for God to forgive the Jews’ sins
that had in the past led to their defeat in battle (1 Kgs. 8:33-34).
<u>Third</u>, he prayed for God to forgive the Jews’ sins that had in
the past also brought drought and famine to the lands (1 Kgs. 8:35-36;
Lev. 26:19.). <u>Fourth</u>, he prayed that God would forgive the Jews’
sins that had resulted in other calamities in the past (1 Kgs. 8:37-40).
<u>Fifth</u>, he prayed for God to show mercy to God-fearing foreigners
who would not have fully complied with the laws given to Moses (1 Kgs.
8:41-43). Even though the Jews were privileged to have God’s Temple, it
was meant to be a place of prayer for all the nations (Is. 56:7).
<u>Sixth</u>, he prayed for God to forgive their sins and grant them
victory in battle (1 Kgs. 8:44-45). <u>Finally</u>, in a prophetic
recognition of their future exile, Solomon prayed that God would forgive
the Jews’ sins and restore them after their future captivity (1 Kgs.
8:46-54).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The universal nature of sin should normally disqualify God’s
response to prayer</u>. As part of his prayer, Solomon recognized that
all have sinned and fallen short before God: “<em><sup>46 </sup>When
they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin)</em> . . .”
(1 Kgs. 8:46). Sin has also separated you from God: “But your iniquities
have made a separation between you and your God . . .” (Is. 59:2(a)).
The universal nature of sin is repeated throughout the Bible: “[I]t is
written, ‘There is none righteous, not even one; there is no one who
understands, no one who seeks God.”’ (Rom. 3:10-11; Ecc. 7:20). “[T]here
is no one who does good.” (Ps. 14:1; 53:1). “Do not bring your servant
into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.” (Ps. 143:2).
“If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is
not in us.” (1 Jo. 1:8). In the Old Testament, God warned that as a
consequence of the separation caused by sin, He would not hear the
prayers of sinners: “So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will
hide My eyes from you; yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not
listen. Your hands are covered with blood.” (Is. 1:15). “And your sins
have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear. For your hands
are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have
spoken falsehood, your tongue mutters wickedness.” (Is. 59:2-3(b)). “We
know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but He does listen to anyone
who worships Him and does His will.” (Jo. 9:31; Prov. 15:29; 8:9; Ps.
66:18). In the New Testament, He warns that sin can “hinder” a
believer’s prayers (1 Pet. 3:7). God wants you to regularly pray for
Jesus to cleanse and forgive your sins so that your prayers are not
hindered.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God blessed the Jews with forgiveness</u>. In response to
Solomon’s prayer, God created a clean heart in both him and in the
people: “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and
pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear
from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chron.
7:14). Yet, both Solomon and the Jews would soon squander God’s
forgiveness with open sin.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus can also clean your heart of sin and allow you to go
boldly into the throne room</u>. If you repent, Jesus will also bless
you by forgiving you (1 Jo. 1:9). Through His death on the cross, He has
made you blameless with His righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21).
Through His righteousness, you can now approach God the Father in the
throne room in boldness as you pray for others, just as Solomon did for
his people (Heb. 4:16). Are you praying boldly for others who are caught
in sin and in need of forgiveness?</p></li>

<u>Obedience: Spirit-Led Worship Seeks the Strength to be Obedient</u>.
1 Kgs. 8:54-61.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon’s benediction and his request for God to help the
people to obey</u>. In recognition of mankind’s inherently sinful
nature, Solomon then prayed as a benediction to the people for the
strength to obey God’s Word: “<sup>54 </sup><em>When Solomon had
finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he arose from before the altar of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, from kneeling on his knees with his
hands spread toward heaven. <sup>55 </sup>And he stood and blessed all
the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying: <sup>56 </sup>‘Blessed
be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who has given rest to His
people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has
failed of all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His
servant. <sup>57 </sup>May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our
God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not leave us or
forsake us, <sup>58 </sup>that He may incline our hearts to Himself, to
walk in all His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and
His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. <sup>59 </sup>And may
these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, be near to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God day and night, that He may
maintain the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, as
each day requires, <sup>60 </sup>so that all the peoples of the earth
may know that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is God; there is
no one else. <sup>61 </sup>Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, to walk in His statutes
and to keep His commandments, as at this day</em>.”’ (1 Kgs. 8:54-61).
Solomon’s benediction included a reminder to the Jews that God had been
faithful to them (1 Kgs. 8:56). In response to God’s faithfulness,
Solomon urged the people to be faithful and obey. Yet, because mankind
is inherently sinful, he prayed for God to give the people the wisdom to
know His will and the strength to obey God’s Word (1 Kgs. 8:57-61). If
the people exhibited obedience, God’s people would be a light to all the
world (1 Kgs. 8:60). In a similar way Jesus’ followers today are a light
to others through their holy conduct (Matt. 5:14-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God desires obedience more than sacrifice</u>. God wanted the
Jews’ obedience more than their sacrifices. “Samuel said, ‘Has the LORD
as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the
voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed
than the fat of rams.” (1 Sam. 15:22). David previously learned that
“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, You will not despise.” (Ps. 51:17). Are you obedient in
your walk with Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. A
believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. Yet, Jesus is not your Lord if you
disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in
heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and
do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the
word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22).
“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may
be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt.
7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them,
will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt.
7:26). If you call Jesus your Lord, is there any area of your life where
you are refusing to obey Him?</p></li>

<u>Atonement: Spirit-Led Worship Praises Jesus’ Atonement of Sin</u>. 1

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon’s 144,000 dedicatory sacrifices</u>. Solomon’s
dedication ceremony also included the sacrifice of a staggering 144,000
animals to atone for the Jews’ sins: “<sup>62 </sup><em>Now the king and
all Israel with him offered sacrifice before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>63 </sup>Solomon offered for the
sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the
king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>64 </sup>On the same day the king
consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, because there he offered the burnt
offering and the grain offering and the fat of the peace offerings; for
the bronze altar that was before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
was too small to hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the
fat of the peace offerings</em>.” (1 Kgs. 8:62-64). These sacrifices
came in connection with both the dedication of the Temple and the
concurrent Feast of Tabernacles / <em>Sukkot</em>. To atone for the
nation’s sin, Solomon sacrificed both 22,000 bulls and 120,000 sheep (1
Kgs. 8:63). With the shedding of blood, there could be no atonement of
sin. And without the atonement of sin, salvation, fellowship with God,
and His willingness to hear your prayers would not be possible: “And
according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with
blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” (Heb.
9:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Celebrate that Jesus was the final and complete sacrifice</u>.
During the Feast, the Jews made an offering by fire to the Lord (Lev.
23:37). Including two lambs that were normally sacrificed each day (Nu.
28:2), the normal number of burnt offering included 215 animal
sacrifices: (1) 71 one-year old bulls without defect; (2) 15 rams
without defect; (3) 121 lambs without defect; and (4) eight goats
without defect. In addition, the meal offerings included oil offerings,
wine offerings, and 336 tenths of “ephahs” of fine flour (Nu. 29:12-39).
Solomon’s sacrifices totaled 144,000 animals (1 Kgs. 8:63). This was
more than 669 times the normal number of sacrifices. Although the Jews
had to sacrifice animals to atone for their sins, Jesus was a one-time
sacrifice who forever freed us from the obligation to sacrifice animals
in order to have our sins forgiven (Heb. 10:14). If God was willing to
accept the sacrifice of animals on our behalf, we have no reason to
doubt Jesus’ ability to atone for even the worst sinners (Heb. 9:14).
Have you given thanks for Jesus’ death and the atonement of sin that He
makes possible?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The 144,000 saved during the end times</u>. Everything in the
Bible has meaning. There were 144,000 sacrifices during the dedication
of the Temple (1 Kgs. 8:63). This may correlate to the 144,000 who will
be saved during the Great Tribulation (Rev. 7:5-8). Or, there may be
some other meaning that God will reveal in heaven.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Solomon and the people celebrate during the Feast of
Tabernacles / Sukkot</u>. The dedication process concluded with an
eight-day celebration during the Feast of Tabernacles / Sukkot:
“<sup>65 </sup><em>So Solomon observed the feast at that time, and all
Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the
brook of Egypt, before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God,
for seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days. <sup>66 </sup>On
the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king. Then
they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness
that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had shown to David His
servant and to Israel His people</em>.” (1 Kgs. 8:65-66). The peoples
came from the furthest most places in Israel from the south to the north
for this moment (1 Kgs. 8:65). It was a time of joyous celebration
across all of Israel (1 Kgs. 8:66).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for your new beginnings in Jesus</u>. The Feast of
Tabernacles lasted eight days (1 Kgs. 8:66). After the seven-day
festival, the people were together for a holy convocation on the eighth
day (Lev. 23:36). Seven is a number of completeness in the Bible. God
created the world in six days and rested on the seventh (Ex. 20:11). The
ordination of the priests also lasted seven days (Lev. 8:35-36). The
number eight in the Bible symbolizes new beginnings. The priest’s new
duties began on the eighth day (Lev. 9:1). The eighth day was also the
day that a child was to be circumcised as being part of his covenant
with God (Lev. 12:3). Christ also rose from the dead on a Sunday, the
eighth day or the first day of the new week (Matt. 28:1). If you are
excited for the new beginnings that Jesus made possible, this is the
appointed time to celebrate it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also came to bring joy</u>. God’s holy days revealed the
“shadows” of Christ (Col. 2:17). <em>Sukkot</em> was the most joyful
holy day. It celebrates when God came to dwell or “tabernacle” amongst
us. It also foreshadowed both when Christ dwelled with us and when He
will again “tabernacle” with us during His 1,000-year reign on Earth. It
also foreshadowed the joy that comes from Him alone (Lk. 2:10-11). This
Feast was a “<em>perpetual statute throughout your generation</em>. . .
” (Lev. 23:41). If you celebrate it, “your God will
<strong>bless</strong> you in all your produce and in all the work of
your hands. . .” (Dt. 16:15). Thus, you can receive a blessing when you
celebrate Jesus on this day.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be filled with the joy of the Spirit</u>. Jesus offers you an
abundant life: “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I
came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.” (Jo. 10:10). The
abundant life that He offers includes the peace and joy that only the
Holy Spirit can provide: “the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
righteousness, peace and <em>joy in the Holy Spirit</em>.” (Ro. 14:17).
“<em>[I]n Your presence is fullness of joy</em>;” (Ps. 16:11; 21:6). Joy
is also a fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22; Ro. 14:17; 15:13). Living your
faith and walking with Jesus also involves sharing the joy of the Spirit
with others: “ . . . <em>I rejoice and share my joy with you</em>.”
(Phil. 2:17(b)). “<em>Make my joy complete</em> by being of the same
mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one
purpose.” (Phil. 2:2). When you suffer setbacks, do others see in you
the joy of the Spirit? If you are only filled with anger or resentment,
what kind of a witness are you?</p></li>
