<h1 id="psalm-132-lessons-for-finding-hope-in-jesus-unfulfilled-promises"><strong>Psalm 132: Lessons for Finding Hope in Jesus’ Unfulfilled Promises</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the thirteenth Song of Ascents (Ps. 120–134). According to one scholar’s interpretation, “Israel had been restored from exile. The Temple had been rebuilt. Jehovah had returned to dwell in Zion according to His promise. But was His other promise of an eternal dominion to the house of David to be annulled? Was David’s zeal in establishing the worship of Jehovah in Jerusalem to be forgotten? Were the prayers and hopes of that memorable occasion to be doomed to final disappointment? Surely it could not be. Such seem to have been the circumstances under which this Psalm was written, and the thoughts to which it was designed to give expression.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 132:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This was an uncertain time. Some of God’s promises remained unfulfilled. These included the restoration of the Davidic kings and Israel’s full sovereignty. The psalmist sought to encourage the Jews to put their hope in God through David’s example, prayer, and by restating God’s promises. Many believers also struggle with the Bible’s unfulfilled promises. Here, God offers several lessons for finding hope while waiting for His Word to be fulfilled. These include showing: (1) loving devotion, (2) worship, (3) joyful righteousness, (4) prayer, (5) obedience, (6) trust, and (7) faith.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, God’s Shekinah glory was once present in the Tabernacle. As an act of loving devotion, David worked tirelessly to obtain the resources needed to build God’s Temple. He was eager to restore God’s Shekinah glory in Israel. Through loving devotion, you can also show your desire to be in God’s presence. <u>Second</u>, David sought to return God’s ark to Jerusalem to restore proper worship for all the people. When you struggle during times of uncertainty, you can follow David’s example by seeking out worship opportunities. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist pleaded for God to clothe His priests in righteousness and allow them to sing for joy. Through Jesus’ atoning sacrifice, He offers to clothe you in His righteousness. While you wait for all of God’s promises to be fulfilled, you can live as a joyful living sacrifice of righteousness for His use. <u>Fourth</u>, in the face of God’s unfulfilled Davidic Covenant, the psalmist pleaded in prayer, “<em>do not turn away the face of Your anointed</em>.” For any unfulfilled need in your life, God wants you to respond with patience and by petitioning Him through prayer. <u>Fifth</u>, God made an eternal Covenant with David. But part of this Covenant was conditioned on the Jews’ obedience. Your salvation is not based upon your obedience. But some of the blessings that you may hope for can be delayed when you embrace disobedience or rebellion. <u>Sixth</u>, as part of the Davidic Covenant, God promised that the Messiah would rule from Jerusalem for all eternity and provide for His people. That promise remained unfulfilled following the Jews’ return from Babylonian captivity. But the Jews had to trust in God to fulfill His promises. Jesus promises to return one day to rule over all creation, and He will provide for you. In response, He desires that you put your trust in Him. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist repeated God’s promise that the Messiah will offer salvation to all. Jesus came to fulfill this promise. To accept His offer of salvation, you only need to have faith.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David sought to passionately serve God by building His Temple</u>. Out of a deep love for God, David worked tirelessly to select a location and obtain the resources needed to build a Temple to house the ark. “<em>A Song of Ascents. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Remember, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in David’s behalf, all his affliction; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>how he swore to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob, <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>‘I certainly will not enter my house, nor lie on my bed; <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>until I find a place for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob</em>.’” (Ps. 132:1-5). “The historical books give no account of this vow, which, however, may have been recorded in one or other of the lost compositions spoken of so frequently in Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-11.htm">2 Chronicles 16:11</a>, etc.).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 132:1-5).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> “The Psalmist pleads David’s services in establishing the worship of Jehovah in Jerusalem as a reason why Jehovah should remember the promises made to him … ‘The Davidic covenant was to Ezra or Nehemiah what the Abrahamic was to Moses—the focus from which the rays of Divine comfort emanated.”’ (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 132:1-5).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David and his descendants suffered while the waited for God’s promises</u>. David was blessed to be the recipient of God’s Covenant But God had to first mold David through suffering to prepare his heart to be the heir to the Covenant (Ps. 132:1). “The phrase ‘all the hardships he endured’ refers to the numerous trials and tribulations that David faced throughout his life. The Hebrew word for ‘hardships’ is ‘<span dir="rtl">עֳנִי</span>’ (oni), which conveys a sense of affliction, suffering, and humility. David’s life was marked by significant challenges, including his struggles with King Saul, his own moral failures, and the rebellion of his son Absalom. These hardships are not merely personal struggles but are seen as part of the larger narrative of God’s redemptive work through David’s lineage. The mention of David’s endurance serves as a reminder of the perseverance required in the life of faith and the ultimate triumph of God’s purposes despite human frailty. It encourages believers to trust in God’s sovereignty and faithfulness, even amidst trials, knowing that He works all things for the good of those who love Him.” (Berean Study Bible on Ps. 132:1).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> David’s suffering pointed to Jesus’ suffering on the cross (Is. 53:5). For those who love God, their suffering also serves a greater purpose. “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28). He also remembers your afflictions (Ps. 132:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>David’s love for God prompted him to serve with loving devotion</u>. Psalm 132 stresses the perseverance that David showed in obtaining all that was needed for the future building of the Temple. “David’s passion speaks to us in at least two ways: · We should have a passionate drive to enjoy God’s presence in our own lives, that our hearts would truly be His home. · We should have a passionate drive for the blessing and benefit of the house of God, the community of His people.” (David Guzik on Ps. 132:1-5).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Despite his passion, God did not allow David to build His Temple</u>. Although well intentioned, David made the mistake of trying to also build God’s Temple without first seeking to confirm through prayer that that was God’s plan. God then told the prophet Nathan that it was not His plan for David to build His Temple (2 Sam. 7:1-5; 1 Chr. 17:1-4). God did not allow David to build His Temple because David had blood on his hands from his many wars and conflicts. “But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.”’ (1 Chr. 28:23). David also made the mistake of thinking that God needed a home to reside in. God did not need anything from him. Nor does God reside in a physical home like the pagans alleged for their idols. God instead resides in heaven where He rules over all (Is. 66:1-2). Under the Old Testament sacrificial system, God’s Temple was meant to be a place of atonement, reconciliation, and peace. It was not meant for conflict. Because he was a man of peace, God allowed Solomon to build His Temple (1 Kgs. 8:17-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God honored David’s faith with an eternal house</u>. Although David could not build the Temple, God honored him by promising him an eternal dynasty. It would culminate in the Messiah, whose reign will last forever. “When your days are finished and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come from you, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:12-13). “When your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, then I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be from your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.” (1 Chr. 17:11-12). As our example, David found hope in God’s promises through his loving devotion.</p></li>

<h2 id="worship-find-hope-by-seeking-out-worship-opportunities.-ps.-1326-8."><strong>2. <u>Worship: Find Hope by Seeking Out Worship Opportunities</u>. Ps. 132:6-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist encouraged God’s people to seek out worship</u>. The ark had been forgotten while it was hidden during Saul’s reign. David found it and returned it to Jerusalem so that the people could properly worship God. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Behold, we heard about it in Ephrathah, we found it in the field of Jaar. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Let’s go into His dwelling place; let’s worship at His footstool</em>. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>Arise, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength</em>.” (Ps. 132:6-8). “The ark, or of the place or habitation for the Lord last mentioned; <em>at Ephratah —</em>That is, at Shiloh, in the tribe of Ephraim, there they were told it had been, but it was gone; they <em>found it </em>at last <em>in the fields of the wood —</em> That is, in Kirjath-jearim, which signifies, <em>the city of woods. </em>Thence all Israel fetched it, with great solemnity, in the beginning of David’s reign, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm"><u>1 Chronicles 13:6</u></a>; so that, in preparing this place for the ark, he gratified all Israel, they needed not to go about to seek it any more: they now knew where to find it.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Ps. 132:6).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>

<p>David finds the ark and brings it to Jerusalem to restore proper worship<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s ark was hidden for 20 years after Israel turned away from God</u>. At a time when Israel had turned from God, Samuel ensured that the ark was protected at Kiriath-jearim. (1 Sam. 7:1-2). After David unified Israel, he found the ark and brought it from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem so that all could properly worship God (1 Chr. 13:6-7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek out opportunities to worship God</u>. The psalmist said, “<em><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Let’s go into His dwelling place; let’s worship at His footstool</em>.” (Ps. 132:7). At the Tabernacle and then Temple, God offered to have His Shekinah glory dwell with His people. “Have them construct a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them.” (Ex. 25:8; Lev. 26:11-12; 1 Kgs. 6:13). This was a place where the people could then worship Him. “As one of the Songs of Ascents, this song was sung by pilgrim travelers going to the temple in Jerusalem, mainly at feast times. They remembered and understood David’s great heart for God’s house and used it to inspire them as they said, “<strong>Let us go into His tabernacle; let us worship at His footstool</strong>.” (David Guzik on Ps. 132:7) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek out God’s mercy</u>. The psalmist cried out, “<em>Arise, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength</em>.” (Ps. 132:8). This repeated part of Solomon’s prayer of dedication. “Now then arise, LORD God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your might; let Your priests, LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let Your godly ones rejoice in what is good.” (2 Chr. 6:41). At the ark, God offered His people mercy through faith and a proper atoning sacrifice. “There I will meet with you; and from above the atoning cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about every commandment that I will give you for the sons of Israel.” (Ex. 25:22). Like the psalmist, God also desires that you seek out His mercy from your sins that He now makes possible through faith in Jesus’ atoning sacrifice.</p></li>

<h2 id="joyful-righteousness-show-your-hope-in-god-by-living-as-a-joyful-living-sacrifice-of-righteousness-for-him.-ps.-1329."><strong>3. <u>Joyful Righteousness: Show Your Hope in God by Living As a Joyful Living</u> <u>Sacrifice of Righteousness For Him</u>. Ps. 132:9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through faith, God offered to clothe His priests in righteousness</u>. The psalmist cried out for God to make His priests righteous. The psalmist desired that God’s priests would then sing with grateful joy. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and may Your godly ones sing for joy</em>.” (Ps. 132:9). “Righteousness is the best ornament of a minister. Holiness towards God, and goodness towards all men, are habits for ministers of the necessity of which there is no dispute.” (Matthew Henry on Ps 132:9).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith, you become part of Jesus’ royal priesthood</u>. The promises regarding God’s priesthood in the Old Testament remain relevant today. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He can make you one of His priests. “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Pet. 2:9). “and He made us into a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.” (Rev. 1:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is our High Priest</u>. The Jews needed the high priest to be pure (symbolized through holy attire) to be able to intercede for them. While the Jews had a flawed high priest, any believer in Jesus has the High Priest who is without sin: “Therefore, since <em>we have a great high priest</em> who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.” (Heb. 4:14-15). “<em>For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens</em>;” (Heb. 7:26). On Earth, Jesus wore the clothes of a servant. But the beautiful clothes of the high priest, including gold, blue, and white all pointed to Jesus (Exodus 28). The gold symbolizes Jesus’ divinity. The blue symbolized His throne in heaven. The purple symbolized His royalty as the King of Kings (Rev. 19:16). The scarlet symbolized His sacrificial blood (Rev. 7:14; Heb. 9:14; 1 Jo. 1:7). The fine white linen symbolized His righteousness, purity and holiness (Rev. 19:8; 3:5). As believers, He “imparts” elements of His righteousness to us (2 Pet. 1:4; Col. 1:22, 27). You can respond with joyful gratitude and loving devotion.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God clothe you in righteousness</u>. The psalmist asked for God to clothe his priests in righteousness (Ps. 132:9). In the Bible, clothing is a symbol of both God’s provision and a person’s outward actions. After Adam and Eve sinned, God gave them animal skins to wear (Gen. 3:21). After the priest sacrificed an animal without blemish, God ordered that the priests receive the animal skins to make clothing (Lev. 1:6; 7:8). When you seek after Jesus’ kingdom and His righteousness, He also promises to clothe you (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31). He further offers to clothe you in His fine clothes in heaven: “He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.” (Rev. 3:5). If Jesus does not clothe you, your acts will be looked upon as filthy rags to Him: “For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; . . . ” (Is. 64:6). The person who tries to show up in heaven without Christ’s clothes will be thrown out (Matt. 22:11-13). Are you doing things that glorify yourself? Or, are you looking to be clothed in Jesus’ righteousness in order to glorify Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your hope in Jesus’ promises through your joy and your righteous example</u>. The example of the Old Testament priests are recorded for your example to encourage you and to build up your hope in Jesus. “For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.” (Ro. 15:4). You can follow in Jesus’ example with the righteousness He purchased for you at the cross. “Brothers and sisters, join in following my example, and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.” (Phil. 3:17). Your example to others should also include the joy of the Holy Spirit. “You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word during great affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit,” (1 Thess. 1:6). Is the light of Jesus evident to others through your hope, your righteous example, and the joy of the Holy Spirit?</p></li>

<h2 id="prayer-show-your-hope-in-god-through-your-prayer-life.-ps.-13210."><strong>4. <u>Prayer: Show Your Hope in God Through Your Prayer Life</u>. Ps. 132:10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek God in prayer for any unfulfilled need</u>. Following Babylonian captivity, the Jews continued to live under Persian rule, then Greek, and then Roman rule. With the Davidic covenant not yet fulfilled, the psalmist cried out in prayer for God to fulfill His Covenant. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>For the sake of Your servant David, do not turn away the face of Your anointed</em>.” (Ps. 132:10). “It is a dreadful thing to have our face turned away from God, or to have his face turned away from us. If we are anointed of the Spirit the Lord will look upon us with favour. Specially is this true of Him who represents us, and is on our behalf the <em>Christ</em>—the truly anointed of the Lord. Jesus is both our David and God’s anointed; in him is found in fullness that which David received in measure. For his sake all those who are anointed in him are accepted.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 132:10) (italics original).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Crying out to God in times of need is a sign of your faith in Him</u>. The psalmist did not show a lack of faith in asking God to fulfill His promises. Instead, he showed that he talked with God the way a child might call out to a parent. You show your faith when you cry out to God for any need in your life. “Let my cry come before You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; give me understanding according to Your word.” (Ps. 119:169; 119:144). “Let my pleading come before You; save me according to Your word.” (Ps. 119:170; 119:154; 59:1). For any unfulfilled need or broken relationship, are you regularly crying out to God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for the fulfillment of God’s Word</u>. For any unfulfilled need, believers are encouraged to pray for the fulfillment of God’s Word. “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father, who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.”’ (Matt. 6:9-10). “The promises of the new covenant bring together all the promises that were made in the past, so that the Davidic covenant will ultimately be fulfilled as Jesus the Messiah comes to reign in power and glory to the everlasting joy of the saints and the everlasting shame of his enemies. It is right for us to pray for that, as indeed Christ taught us to do in the Lord’s Prayer. To this we may add, ‘Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 132).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be patient for God’s timing</u>. The Psalms also remind believers to be patient and wait for God to act in His perfect timing: “<em>Wait for the LORD</em>; be strong and let your heart take courage; <em>yes, wait for the LORD</em>.” (Ps. 27:14). “<em>Our soul waits for the LORD</em>; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:20). “<em>My soul waits in silence for God alone; from Him comes my salvation</em>.” (Ps. 62:1). “<em>I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and I wait for His word</em>.” (Ps. 130:5). “I have certainly soothed and quieted my soul; like a weaned child <em>resting</em> against his mother, my soul within me is like a weaned child.” (Ps. 131:2). When your trials are ongoing, will you wait for God to act in His perfect timing?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="obedience-show-your-hope-in-god-through-obedience.-ps.-13211-12."><strong>5. <u>Obedience: Show Your Hope in God Through Obedience</u>. Ps. 132:11-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Part of God’s Covenant was conditional</u>. God promised David an eternal Covenant with a Messiah who would reign forever. But whether the Jews had a continuous king on the throne and whether they would receive God’s continuous instruction was in part conditioned on their obedience. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has sworn to David a truth from which He will not turn back: ‘I will set upon your throne one from the fruit of your body. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If your sons will keep My covenant and My testimony which I will teach them, their sons also will sit upon your throne forever</em>.’” (Ps. 132:11-12). “This was the condition implied in the promise - that they were to keep the law of God, and to serve and obey him. If they did not, they could not, of course, plead the promise. This principle is universal. We cannot plead any promise of God on our behalf, or on behalf of our children, unless we obey his commands, and are ourselves faithful to him.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 132:12).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The disobedience of the Davidic kings caused the Davidic rule to be temporarily broken</u>. God’s promise of an eternal dynasty was unconditional. But God warned that the disobedience could impact whether the Jews had kings who could continuously sit on the throne. “<em><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If your sons will keep My covenant and My testimony which I will teach them, their sons also will sit upon your throne forever</em>.’” (Ps. 132:12). Sadly, the Jews ignored God’s warnings. “Solomon, [David’s] immediate successor, fell into idolatry in the latter part of his life; and Rehoboam, his son, slighted the advice of the old men, founded upon the laws of God, and ten tribes revolted from him: several succeeding kings of Judah, of the house of David, were very wicked princes; and the race of them ended in Zedekiah, who was carried captive into Babylon.” (John Gill’s Commentary on Ps. 132:12).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God was forced to discipline David’s descendants to correct them</u>.  Jesus cannot sin (2 Cor. 5:21).  But David and his other descendants sinned.  God warned that the eternal kingship would not exempt them from discipline, just as a loving father discipline a wayward son:  “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,”<em> </em> (2 Sam. 7:14).  Because they did not repent, Israel temporarily had some of its blessings removed. In a similar way, God disciplines His people out of love:  “Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.”  (Dt. 8:5).  “It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?”  (Heb. 12:7).  “But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.”  (1 Cor. 11:32).  If God has disciplined you and some blessing in your life has been temporarily removed, do not lose hope. Instead, repent of your sins and turn back to God. In His perfect timing, He can restore your blessings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will not forsake you when He disciplines you</u>.  Even though God disciplined David’s descendants, He promised never to forsake them and remove their right to an eternal kingship:  “but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.”  (2 Sam. 7:15).  “But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him, nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.”  (Ps. 89:33).  “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you.  He will not fail you or forsake you.”  (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5).  “At this point in the Psalter, we know that the kings were not obedient. The line of descent was dethroned when the crown was defiled in the dust (89:39 [MT 89:40]). But in Yahweh’s mercy, he means to rebuild the house, to restore the king from David’s line (see esp. Ps 110). If it were not so, Ps 132 would not be restating Yahweh’s promise to David.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 132:12).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> God will also never abandon His promises to you.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God chose Jerusalem to be the place where the Messiah would fulfill His promises</u>. As an unconditional promise, God stated that the Messiah would rule for all eternity from Jerusalem, and He will provide for His people. ‘“<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has chosen Zion; He has desired it as His dwelling place. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>‘This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>I will abundantly bless her food; I will satisfy her needy with bread</em>.”’ (Ps. 132:13-15). Zion was another name for Jerusalem. God blessed Jerusalem as the place where God’s Messiah will reign “Why do you look with envy, you mountains of many peaks, at the mountain God has desired as His dwelling? Indeed, the LORD will dwell there forever.” (Ps. 68:16; 1 Kgs. 11:36; 2 Chr. 6:6; Zech. 2:12; Ps. 78:68). The Messiah will reign for eternity in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus came to fulfill God’s eternal Covenant</u>. Jesus was born into David’s line, and He fulfilled the promise of an eternal kingdom. “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of armies will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:7). “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’ (Jer. 32:5). “So I will establish his descendants forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” (Ps. 89:29). “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:” (Matt. 1:1). Peter alludes to the fulfillment of Psalm 132:11 in Acts 2:30: “Brothers, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. So because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne, he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that He was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh suffer decay.” (Acts 2:29-31). Thus, God is faithful to fulfill His promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also promised to provide for the Jews’ needs</u>. God also promised that the Messiah would provide for His people and satisfy them. “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>I will abundantly bless her food; I will satisfy her needy with bread.</em>” (Ps. 132:15). Jesus will also provide for your needs when you seek after His Kingdom. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “But seek His kingdom, and these things will be provided to you.” (Lk. 12:31). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). If you have any need that is unmet, turn to Jesus, pray, and seek after His Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Delight yourself in the things of God, and He will fulfill your desires</u>. If you desire what God desires, He will fulfill your desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). Is your heart set on what God’s desires?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in God to fulfill His promises if your needs are unmet</u>. Israel needed to trust God while it waited. God fulfills His promises in His perfect timing. Even when you feel that you cannot wait any longer, place your trust in God and avoid doing what feels right in your own heart. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD. “For he will be like a tree planted by the water that extends its roots by a stream, and does not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought, nor cease to yield fruit.” (Jer. 17:7-8).</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-show-your-hope-in-gods-promises-through-faith.-ps.-13216-18."><strong>7. <u>Faith: Show Your Hope in God’s Promises Through Faith</u>. Ps. 132:16-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God promised that His salvation would come through the Messiah</u>. Finally, through the Messiah, God promised His people salvation, deliverance from their enemies, and joy. ‘“<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.</em> <em><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>I will make the horn of David spring forth there; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed.</em> <em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>I will clothe his enemies with shame, but upon himself his crown will gleam</em>.”’ (Ps. 132:16-18). “Righteousness is but one feature of blessing, salvation is the whole of it. What cloth of gold is this! What more than a regal array! Garments of salvation! We know who has woven them, who has dyed them, and who has given them to his people. These are the best robes for priests and preachers, for princes and people; there is none like them; give them me. Not every priest shall be thus clothed, but only <em>her</em> priests, those who truly belong to Zion by faith which is in Christ Jesus who hath made them priests unto God.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 132:16) (italics original).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, Jesus will clothe you with eternal salvation</u>. The psalmist promised, “<em>I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her godly ones will sing aloud for joy.</em>” (Ps. 132:16). Through faith in Jesus, He will clothe you in garments of salvation. “I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, my soul will be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, as a groom puts on a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.” (Is. 61:10). All that is required is your faith in Jesus, “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ Shekinah Glory will one day shine over all, and evil will be vanquished</u>. The Messiah, God’s “<em>anointed</em>” will have “<em>the horn</em>” of power (Ps. 132:17). He will defeat all evil, and His crown will glean with His light. “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>I will clothe his enemies with shame, but upon himself his crown will gleam</em>.”’ (Ps. 132:18). Jesus’ Shekinah Glory will forever light His people. “No longer will you have the sun for light by day, nor will the moon give you light for brightness; but you will have the LORD as an everlasting light, and your God as your glory.” (Is. 60:19). “And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illuminate them; and they will reign forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:5). Thus, even if you are now surrounded in darkness, you have the hope of a joyous eternity with Jesus.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Put your hope in Jesus when you experience a trial</u>. When you face a trial or darkness, Jesus also wants you to place your hope in Him alone for deliverance: “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.” (Ps. 39:7). “For I wait for You, LORD; You will answer, Lord my God.” (Ps. 38:15). “For You are my hope; Lord GOD, You are my confidence from my youth.” (Ps. 71:5). When you face a trial, do you place your hope in Jesus or in the things of this world?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews needed to have faith in God’s Covenant</u>. Psalm 132’s implicit message was that God had not forgotten His Covenant with David. His Word cannot be broken. “This is what the LORD says: ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night do not occur at their proper time, then My covenant with David My servant may also be broken, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers.”’ (Jer. 33:20-21). While we wait for the fulfillment of God’s promises, we are also called upon to have faith.</p></li>
