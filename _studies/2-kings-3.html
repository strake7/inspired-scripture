Kings 3: Lessons from the Jews’ War Against Moab for Success in
Spiritual Warfare</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: In 2 Kings 3, the Bible recounts how the Jews
turned a near defeat in a war against Moab into a victory. Today, our
battles are mostly spiritual and not physical: “For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers,
against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces
of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12). Through the Jews’
mistakes and later successes, God reveals seven lessons for success in
spiritual warfare. These include: (1) having faith, (2) being
Spirit-led, (3) humility, (4) being God’s salt and light, (5) worship,
(6) obedience, and (7) judging the evil desires of your flesh.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Jehoram feared God after seeing God strike down both
his father Ahab and brother Ahaziah. Yet, he was unwilling to part with
his idolatry. Without God, he would face a revolt in Moab that he could
not control. From Jehoram’s mistake, God reveals that success in
spiritual warfare is impossible without faith. <u>Second</u>, Jehoram
turned to the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, to fight the Moabites. The two
succeeded in unifying God’s people. Yet, they failed to initially seek
God’s guidance. From their mistakes, God reveals that success in
spiritual warfare requires Spirit-led unity of the Church. <u>Third</u>,
the Jewish kings escaped death in a desert by humbling themselves before
God’s prophet Elisha. From this example, God reveals that success in
spiritual warfare requires humility before God. <u>Fourth</u>, Elisha
first confronted Jehoram for his sins before he agreed to help. Like
Elisha, success in spiritual warfare requires being God’s salt and light
to sinners. <u>Fifth</u>, Elisha used musicians to prepare the thirsty
Jews for God’s Word. From this example, God reveals that success in
spiritual warfare requires worshiping God. <u>Sixth</u>, God rewarded
the Jews for their obedience by both providing for their needs and by
confusing their enemy. From their example, God reveals that success in
spiritual warfare requires Spirit-led obedience. <u>Finally</u>, God
used the Jews to judge the Moabites, who symbolized the flesh. Success
in spiritual warfare also requires that you judge the evil desires of
your flesh.</p>

Faith</u>. 2 Kgs. 3:1-3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehoram continues the evil idolatry of Northern Israel</u>.
After seeing God strike down both his father and brother, Jehoram
dispensed with the state-sanctioned Baal worship in Northern Israel.
Yet, he was unwilling to part with all forms of idolatry:
“<sup>1</sup> <em>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at
Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
twelve years. <sup>2 </sup>He did evil in the sight of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, though not like his father and his
mother; for he put away the sacred pillar of Baal which his father had
made. <sup>3 </sup>Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, which he made Israel sin; he did not depart from
them</em>.” (2 Kgs. 3:1-3). Jehoram was the ninth consecutive evil king
of Northern Israel. He was Ahaziah’s brother and the second son of Ahab
(1 Kgs. 22:51). He reigned for 12 years from 852 to 841 B.C. (2 Kgs.
3:1). His reign began in the 18<sup>th</sup> year of Jehoshaphat’s reign
in Judah. Jehoram must have felt some conviction regarding his father’s
pagan worship. Thus, he removed a sacred pillar used in connection with
Baal worship that his father Ahab created (1 Kgs. 16:32-33). Yet, he
still did evil in God’s eyes by continuing the idolatry first started
under the first king, Jeroboam, including the worship of golden calves
and a counterfeit priesthood (1 Kgs. 12:26-33; 13:33; 2 Kgs. 3:2-3). He
kept the caves at the cities of Beth-el and Dan to keep the Jews from
worshiping at the Temple in Jerusalem. Moreover, he did not destroy the
Baal pillar. He simply put it in storage. It would appear again at the
end of Jehoram’s reign (2 Kgs. 10:26-27). Thus, his actions were
calculated to avoid God’s punishment while still trusting in himself for
control over his nation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You cannot have dual allegiances between God and the idols of
the world</u>. God warned the Jews not to tolerate idols in their lives.
They were instead ordered to destroy their idols: “You shall not worship
their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you
shall utterly overthrow them and break their sacred pillars in pieces.”
(Ex. 23:24). “You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set
up for yourselves an image or a sacred pillar, nor shall you place a
figured stone in your land to bow down to it; for I am the LORD your
God.” (Lev. 26:1). Like Jehoram, many believers know that God exists.
Yet, they remain unwilling to part with the idols in their
lives.</p></li>
<li><p><u>True faith is more than seeking to avoid God’s punishment</u>.
Because Jehoram lacked any real faith in God, his heart was still evil
in God’s eyes. “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he
who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of
those who seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6). If you are seeking to avoid God’s
punishment without walking in faith, your actions will also be
unpleasant to God.</p></li>

Spirit-led<u>: Success in Spiritual Warfare Requires Spirit-led
Unity</u>. 2 Kgs. 3:4-8.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Moabites rebel against Northern Israel, and the Jews unite
against them</u>. Because the Jews were weakened through idolatry,
internal conflicts and wars with the Syrians, a vassal king in Moab
exploited this chaos by refusing to pay further tribute to Northern
Israel: “<sup>4 </sup><em>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder,
and used to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000
rams. <sup>5 </sup>But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against
the king of Israel. <sup>6 </sup>And King Jehoram went out of Samaria at
that time and mustered all Israel. <sup>7 </sup>Then he went and sent
word to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, ‘The king of Moab has
rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?’ And he
said, ‘I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my
horses as your horses.’ <sup>8 </sup>He said, ‘Which way shall we go
up?’ And he answered, ‘The way of the wilderness of Edom</em>.’” (2 Kgs.
3:4-8). Mesha was a regent as opposed to a formal king: “Now there was
no king in Edom; a deputy was king.” (1 Kgs. 22:47). From sources
outside of the Bible, scholars have confirmed this rebellion. A stone
monument in Jordan called the “Mesha” Stele or Moabite Stone (circa 840
B.C.) recounts how Mesha responded to the oppression under the house of
King Omri, which would have included his heirs Ahab, Ahaziah and
Jeroram. Moab was east of the dead sea and was forced to pay yearly
tribute to the Jews after King David conquered them (2 Sam. 8:2). Mesha
felt that the yearly tribute of lambs and wool was excessive. Because
Northern Israel was weakened from constant conflict with the Syrians,
Ahab’s death and divisions with Judah, he felt that the time was right
to rebel. He first rebelled in 853 B.C. when Ahab’s oldest son Ahaziah
became king (2 Kgs. 1:1). After Jehoram became king, he prepared
Northern Israel for war. He also asked Jehoshaphat to have the Jews from
Judah assist him in the battle (2 Kgs. 3:7). Jehoshaphat previously used
almost identical words to form an agreement to fight with Ahab to fight
against the Assyrians: “And [Ahab] said to Jehoshaphat, ‘Will you go
with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?’ And Jehoshaphat said to the king of
Israel, ‘I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your
horses.”’ (1 Kgs. 22:4). Yet, God was forced to intervene to save
Jehoshaphat’s life after Ahab tried to trick the Assyrians into thinking
that Jehoshaphat was the King of Northern Israel (2 Chr. 18:31-32).
Jehoshaphat, however, may have overlooked his prior mistake because the
Moabites had previously attacked him: “Now it came about after this that
the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, together with some of the
Meunites, came to make war against Jehoshaphat.” (2 Chr. 20:1).
Jehoshaphat had also forgotten Ahab’s betrayal when he formed an unholy
alliance with Ahab’s son Ahaziah: “<sup>35 </sup>After this Jehoshaphat
king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. He acted
wickedly in so doing.” (2 Chr. 20:35). Thus, Jehoshaphat seemed to have
little concern about forming an alliance with a third wicked king from
Northern Israel. Jehoram asked Jehoshaphat where to attack because of
his greater experience in battle. He proposed attacking through the
“wilderness of Edom,” which was on the southern end of the Dead Sea (2
Kgs. 3:8). This desert area was considered the least defended portion of
Moab. Yet, it was also dangerous for a traveling army because it lacked
water. Edom, which was to the south of Moab, was also a vassal state of
Judah and hostile to the Moabites (2 Kgs. 3:9). Yet, not long after this
battle, it would also rebel against Judah: “In his days Edom revolted
from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.” (2 Kgs.
8:20).</p></li>

<p>Jehoram refused to trust in only God, and his nation suffered on the
battlefield<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Do not trust in your own strength and understanding</u>.
Jehoshaphat did not consult with God regarding whether to join the Jews
of Northern Israel in battle against Moab. He also did not consult with
God regarding the path that he should take. Instead, he relied upon his
own understanding of the wilderness area and the Moabites to pick their
route. If God had not miraculously intervened, this mistake would have
resulted in the death of all three armies from thirst in the desert.
Jehoshaphat forgot that God alone would determine their success in
battle: “For by their own sword they did not possess the land, and their
own arm did not save them, but Your right hand and Your arm and the
light of Your presence, for You favored them.” (Ps. 44:3). “and that all
this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by
spear; for the battle is the LORD’S and He will give you into our
hands.” (1 Sam. 17:47). “Some boast in chariots and some in horses, but
we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). “The king
is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not delivered by great
strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it deliver
anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17). “For I will not trust in
my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “O give us help against
the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Do you
trust in God or your own abilities to succeed in your
conflicts?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Act with one accord, yet under the direction of the Holy
Spirit</u>. Jehoshaphat’s father Asa fought wars against Northern Israel
(1 Kgs. 15:16). In contrast, Jehoshaphat searched for peace and unity
with Ahab (1 Kgs. 22:44). He again searched for peace and unity with
Jehoram (2 Kgs. 3:7). His love for uniting God’s people was a virtue:
“Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of
unity.” (Col. 3:14). Each person in God’s army should work together
because He has given each person different gifts: “But now there are
many members, but <em>one body</em>. And the eye cannot say to the hand,
‘I have no need of you’; or again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need
of you.’” (1 Cor. 12:20-21). Yet, this unity must be under Christ’s
leadership through the Holy Spirit or it has nothing to do with God: “so
we, who are many, <em>are one body in Christ</em>, and individually
members one of another.” (Ro. 12:5). “Since there is one bread, we who
are many are <em>one body</em>; for we all partake of the one bread.” (1
Cor. 10:17). “For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are <em>one
body</em>, so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12). “There is <em>one
body</em> and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of
your calling;” (Eph. 4:4). Thus, although Jehoshaphat succeeded in
unifying God’s people, he failed to seek God’s guidance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through the Spirit, seek help from your brothers and
sisters</u>. God calls believers “sheep.” (Jo. 10:27). Sheep have no
natural defenses. When you act alone, you put yourself at risk for the
enemy’s attacks (1 Pet. 5:8). To obtain the protection offered from
God’s flock, you must stay connected to others in Church: “not forsaking
our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging
one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb.
10:25). When united by the Spirit, believers in Christ are also
commanded to “fight the good fight of faith . . . ” (1 Tim. 6:12).
Believers are also called upon to fight in His army (2 Tim. 2:3). When
you feel persecuted or under attack, are you seeking Spirit-led help
from your brothers and sisters?</p></li>

<u>Humility: Success in Spiritual Warfare Requires Humility Before
God</u>. 2 Kgs. 3:9-12.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The two Jewish kings nearly die of thirst before turning to
God</u>. By relying upon his own wisdom, Jehoshaphat nearly caused the
Jewish armies to die from thirst in the desert. In their moment of
desperation, he sought out God’s prophet for guidance:
“<sup>9 </sup><em>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and
the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey, and
there was no water for the army or for the cattle that followed them.
<sup>10 </sup>Then the king of Israel said, ‘Alas! For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has called these three kings to give them
into the hand of Moab.’ <sup>11 </sup>But Jehoshaphat said, ‘Is there
not a prophet of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> here, that we
may inquire of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> by him?’ And one
of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, ‘Elisha the son of
Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.’
<sup>12 </sup>Jehoshaphat said, ‘The word of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is with him.’ So the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him</em>.” (2 Kgs.
3:9-12). After seven days of marching in desert terrain, the three
armies of Israel, Judah and Edom had run out of water (2 Kgs. 3:9).
Because he lacked faith, Jehoram was convinced that the three allied
armies would die of thirst or because of a weakened state when in battle
(2 Kgs. 3:10). In contrast, because Jehoshaphat was a man of faith, he
asked for a prophet to guide them, something he should have done in the
very beginning (2 Kgs. 3:11). With almost identical words, he previously
asked for a prophet when Ahab asked Jehoshaphat to fight against the
Assyrians: “But Jehoshaphat said, ‘Is there not yet a prophet of the
LORD here that we may inquire of him?”’ (1 Kgs. 22:7). At that time, the
prophet Micaiah predicted defeat. Yet, neither king listened.
Jehoshaphat may have learned from this mistake. Thus, he asked to meet
with Elisha. Unlike his prior encounter with Micaiah, this time
Jehoshaphat recognized Elisha as God’s true prophet.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God guided and protected the Jews only when they sought out
His advice and obeyed it</u>. Despite his frequent failures of faith,
Jehoshaphat was still considered a godly man (1 Kgs. 22:41-43). Even
though he delayed in doing so, he eventually sought God’s guidance and
now listened to it. In contrast, Jehoram feared God because of his
ongoing idolatry. He had seen God strike down both his father and
brother: “Both Jehoram and Jehoshaphat believed there was a spiritual,
divine element to their current crisis. Jehoram believed that God was to
be <em>avoided</em> because of the crisis, while Jehoshaphat believed
that God should be <em>sought</em> because of the crisis.” (David Guzik
on 2 Kgs. 3).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God exalted both Elisha and the three kings because of their
humility</u>. Jehoram described Elisha as the man who poured water on
Elijah’s hands (2 Kgs. 3:11). This spoke to his selfless and humble
service (1 Kgs. 19:21). God elevated Elisha because he demonstrated his
loyalty in serving Elijah with humility. Just as Elisah did for Elijah,
Jesus washed the feet of the disciples: “Then He poured water into the
basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the
towel with which He was girded.” (Jo. 13:5). The three kings also
honored Elisha by going to him in humility instead of summoning him (2
Kgs. 3:12). Their humility also allowed God to elevate them to victory.
To allow God to exalt you, you must also serve Him in humility: “Whoever
exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be
exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). “A man’s pride will bring him
low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “‘God is
opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”’ (Jam. 4:6(b)). Do
you walk with humility in serving God and others?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Elisha rebukes Jehoram and only agrees to help because of
Jehoshaphat</u>. Because Jehoram had rejected Yahweh, Elisha rejected
his request for help. Jehoram was blessed with God’s protection only
because he walked in the company of a man of faith:
“<sup>13 </sup><em>Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, ‘What do I
have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the
prophets of your mother.’ And the king of Israel said to him, ‘No, for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has called these three kings
together to give them into the hand of Moab.’ <sup>14 </sup>Elisha said,
‘As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts lives, before whom
I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king
of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you</em>.” (2 Kgs. 3:13-14).
Elisha initially told Jehoram to consult with the false prophets of his
father Ahab and his mother Jezebel. This included the counterfeit
priesthood and the prophets of Baal and Asherah (1 Kgs. 18:19; 22:6,
10-12). At this point, Jehoram has developed a fear of God. Thus,
Jehoram proclaimed that God in His sovereignty brought together the
three armies (2 Kgs. 3:13). Yet, his fear of God was not enough to cause
him to turn from his evil ways. Even though Jehoshaphat did evil by
forming alliances with three wicked kings (2 Chr. 20:35), Elisha agreed
to help because he still considered Jehoshaphat to be a man of faith (2
Kgs. 3:14; 1 Kgs. 22:43). Unlike Jehoram, God does not want you to turn
to Him only when you need Him.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s prophets were His salt and light in the wounds of a
sinful world</u>. Elijah’s presence caused others to feel convicted of
their sins: “So she said to Elijah, ‘What do I have to do with you, O
man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and
to put my son to death!”’ (1 Kgs. 17:18). Also following in Elijah’s
example, Elisha sought to convict Jehoram of his sins. God would show
His love and willingness to assist Jehoram. Yet, He would do so despite
Jehoram’s conduct, not because of it. He would also do so to protect the
man of faith, Jehoshaphat, from suffering defeat at the hands of pagan
armies. God would defeat this common enemy of the Jews. Yet, at the end
of this account, God would not restore Jehoram’s control over his vassal
state in Moab because Jehoram was still living in rebellion against God.
God’s later prophets would also be an irritant in the wound of sin. God
also calls upon His people to be salt and light in a fallen world. “You
are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can
it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be
thrown out and trampled under foot by men.” (Matt. 5:13). If you are
God’s salt and light, sinners should feel convicted in your presence. On
the other hand, if you do not convict sinners or lead them to the light
of Jesus, you are not serving a useful role in Jesus’ army.</p></li>

<u>Worship: Success in Spiritual Warfare Requires Worshiping God</u>. 2
Kgs. 3:15-19.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through worship music, Elisha promises both God’s provision
and victory</u>. Because the Jews were focused on their primal needs for
water, Elisha first used music to prepare their minds for God’s prophecy
of victory: “<sup>15<em> </em></sup><em>But now bring me a minstrel.’
And it came about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came upon him. <sup>16 </sup>He said,
‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘Make this valley
full of trenches.’ <sup>17 </sup>For thus says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘You shall not see wind nor shall you see
rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you shall
drink, both you and your cattle and your beasts. <sup>18 </sup>This is
but a slight thing in the sight of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; He will also give the Moabites into your
hand. <sup>19 </sup>Then you shall strike every fortified city and every
choice city, and fell every good tree and stop all springs of water, and
mar every good piece of land with stones.’’”</em> (2 Kgs. 3:15-19).
Elisha called upon a minstrel to reveal God’s Word (2 Kgs. 3:15). God
sometimes used the worship of a musician to reveal His Word to His
prophets (1 Sam. 10:5). God also used worship music to reveal prophecies
(1 Chron. 25:1). The worship served the purpose of refocusing a person
or prophet’s focus on God and off the cares and concerns of the world.
After hearing the worship music, Elisha told the Jews to dig trenches in
the valley where they were standing, somewhere southeast of the Dead Sea
(2 Kgs. 3:16). God then miraculously caused the trenches to be filled
with water without a drop of rain falling or any wind to carry it from
some other place. He did this to provide for the thirsty troops and
animals (2 Kgs. 3:17). Yet, Elisha promised that God would perform an
even greater miracle by defeating the Moabites (2 Kgs. 3:18-19). Because
they would serve as God’s instrument of judgment, they would be allowed
to destroy trees, water wells and lands beyond the limits normally
allowed under His rules for warfare (2 Kgs. 3:19; Dt. 20:19-20). The
attack on the Moabites would humble them in the short term. The attack
on their economic resources would humble them in the long term.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Worship music plays an important role in preparing you to
receive God’s Word</u>. Samuel once told Saul that he would meet
musicians who would also reveal God’s prophetic Word through worship
music: “Afterward you will come to the hill of God where the Philistine
garrison is; and it shall be as soon as you have come there to the city,
that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place
with harp, tambourine, flute, and a lyre before them, and they will be
prophesying.” (1 Sam. 10:5). David also called upon prophets to reveal
God’s Word through worship music: “Moreover, David and the commanders of
the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and of
Heman and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with lyres, harps and
cymbals; and the number of those who performed their service was:” (1
Chr. 25:1). Many of the Levite priests were also musicians because music
was an important part of worship: “Now these are the singers, heads of
fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the chambers of the
temple free from other service; for they were engaged in their work day
and night.” (1 Chr. 8:33). If you are consumed with your challenges, you
may not be in the right frame of mind to receive God’s Word. Is worship
music a central part of your walk with God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The worship music prepared the thirsty men for a great act of
faith</u>. The leaders and their men performed a great act of faith to
realize God’s promise. They were thirsty and near death. It would have
seemed utter madness to be told to dig large trenches in the hot desert
to hold water when no rain clouds were in sight. If their faith was
without works, they would all die of thirst. The worship music cleared
their minds to make this possible.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship includes giving thanks for God’s provision</u>. The
Psalmist gave thanks for God’s provision: “Willingly I will sacrifice to
You; <em>I will give thanks to Your name, O <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for it is good</em>.” (Ps. 54:6). “It is
good to <em>give thanks</em> to the Lord, and to sing praises to Your
<em>name</em>, O Most High.” (Ps. 92:1). “<em>I will be glad</em> and
exult in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2).

came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water</em>.
<sup>21 </sup><em>Now all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up
to fight against them. And all who were able to put on armor and older
were summoned and stood on the border. <sup>22 </sup>They rose early in
the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the
water opposite them as red as blood. <sup>23 </sup>Then they said, ‘This
is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and they have slain one
another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!</em>’” (2 Kgs. 2:20-23). God
confirmed His Word by miraculously filling the trenches with water, just
as Elisha had foretold (2 Kgs. 3:20). By correctly foretelling God’s
actions, Elisha also confirmed that he was a true prophet (Dt.
18:21-22). The Jews and their Edomite allies might have assumed that the
miracle of the water was merely for their provision. They could not have
imagined that God would make the waters appear red to the enemy, causing
them to think that the armies of Edom, Judah and Israel had fought
against each other (2 Kgs. 3:21-23). Because God produced this water
without any rain or wind, the Moabites assumed that it had to be blood
from a battle. They also knew that the Jews from Northern Israel and
Judah had repeatedly fought each other in the past. Thus, this was a
reasonable assumption. Because their gods were fake, they could not
expect a miracle.</p></li>

<li><p><u>God’s many miracles show that you can trust in His promises to
you</u>. God alone can turn a dry desert into water: “He changes a
wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into springs of water;”
(Ps. 107:35). The accuracy of God’s promises and His miracles show that
you can also trust His promises for you as well. “Faithful is He who
calls you, and He also will bring it to pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). “Know
therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps
His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with
those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “God is
faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). He is faithful even when you are
not: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny
Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you given thanks that you can trust in His
faithfulness even when your faith fails Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Holy Spirit can also give life to your dry spiritual
life</u>. God’s ability to provide for you is not limited to your
physical needs. The Holy Spirit can also miraculously restore your
spiritual life: “Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,
and the wilderness becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is
considered as a forest.” (Is. 32:15). If you feel like your life lacks
purpose, pray for the Spirit to give you purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God granted the Jews victory because of their faith and
obedience</u>. The Jews’ obedience made God’s blessings possible. If the
Jews had not acted in faith-led obedience, the waters that God
miraculously provided would not have been captured for them to drink.
They all would have died of thirst. Moreover, the more the men dug in
this faith-led labor, the more they would be blessed by God’s provision:
“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is
against us?” (Ro. 8:31). If you are doing God’s will and you act in
faith, He will also guarantee your victory in His timing.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also promises to confuse your enemies</u>. When you are
obedient, God also promises to cause your enemy to be confused:
“<sup>27 </sup>I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into
confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your
enemies turn their backs to you. <sup>28 </sup>I will send hornets ahead
of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the
Hittites before you.” (Ex. 23:27-28). For example, God allowed Gideon’s
small band of 300 soldiers to defeat 135,000 Midianites by confusing
their soldiers and causing them to attack each other (Jdgs. 7:22). Faith
and obedience can cause your enemies to be confused and fear you. Only a
fool turns down God’s help.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will also bless a nation with protection when its faith
leads to the fruit of obedience</u>. When the Jews followed God’s Word,
He also promised victory (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22; Nu 10:9, 35; Isa.
54:17; Gen. 22:17). God will also bless a faithful and obedient nation
with His hedge of protection against its enemies: “<sup>7 </sup>The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shall cause your enemies who rise up
against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you
one way and will flee before you seven ways.” (Dt. 28:7). ‘“But you will
chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword; five of
you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand,
and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.’” (Lev. 26:7-8).
“One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He
who fights for you, just as He promised you.” (Josh. 23:10). For those
who are obedient and take refuge in God in the face of the enemy, He
promises to be a shield against the enemy’s fiery darts (Prov. 30:5(b);
2 Sam. 22:31). Are you praying for sinners and the nations to repent in
order to receive His blessings?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Act upon God’s Word, and He will bless you</u>. Like the Jews,
God expects you to act on His Word. Obedience is not a test for
salvation. Yet, for those who obey God’s Word, He promises many kinds of
blessings: “So be careful to do what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you; do not turn
aside to the right or to the left. Walk in all the way that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, so that you
may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will
possess.” (Dt. 5:32-33). “O Israel, you should listen and <u>be careful
to do it</u>, that it may be well with you and that you may multiply
greatly, just as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.”
(Dt. 6:3). “But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then
I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your
adversaries.” (Ex. 23:22). Throughout the Bible, God reminds His people
that vows of obedience must be followed by action: “And the LORD said to
me, ‘Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets
of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant <em>and do
them</em>.’” (Jer. 11:6). In case anyone believes that these are relics
of the Old Testament, they are repeated even more often in the New
Testament: “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and <em>do not do what I
say</em>?” (Luke 6:46). “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will
enter the kingdom of heaven, but <em>he who does the will of My</em>
Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Therefore everyone
who hears these words of Mine and <em>acts on them</em>, may be compared
to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and
the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and
yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt.
7:24-25). “[F]or it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before
God, but <em>the doers of the Law will be justified</em>.” (Ro. 2:13).
“But <em>prove yourselves doers of the word</em>, and not merely hearers
who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22; see also, Rev. 14:12; 22:14). God
doesn’t want you to be obedient for the wrong reasons. Out of love (and
not the promise of reward) are you being obedient to God’s Word, His
Spirit, and His calling in your life?</p></li>

Judgment<u>: Success in Spiritual Warfare Requires Judging Your
Flesh</u>. 2 Kgs. 3:24-27.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God confirms His promises of victory by destroying the evil
Moabites</u>. God demonstrated His sovereignty and His faithfulness by
granting the Jews victory, just as He promised: “<sup>24 </sup><em>But
when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites arose and struck
the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into
the land, slaughtering the Moabites. <sup>25 </sup>Thus they destroyed
the cities; and each one threw a stone on every piece of good land and
filled it. So they stopped all the springs of water and felled all the
good trees, until in Kir-hareseth only they left its stones; however,
the slingers went about it and struck it. <sup>26 </sup>When the king of
Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him 700
men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they
could not. <sup>27 </sup>Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in
his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And there
came great wrath against Israel, and they departed from him and returned
to their own land</em>.” (2 Kgs. 3:24-27). With God on their side, the
Jews and their Edomite allies easily crushed their Moabite opponents as
they fled in a confused panic (2 Kgs. 3:24). The allies then destroyed
the trees, the wells and the Moabite capital of Kir-haraseth,
approximately 11 miles east of the Dead Sea (2 Kgs. 3:25). This
confirmed Elisha’s prophecy and demonstrated again that God is faithful
to keep His Word. The Moabite king then decided to attack the Edomites,
possibly believing that God would not protect a pagan army. Here again,
God was faithful to keep His Word, and the Moabites’ counterattack
failed (2 Kgs. 3:26). Theologically, this had important meaning. God was
and remains equally faithful to keep His Word for both Jews and
gentiles. Finally, the Moabite king showed the futility and stupidity of
living for idols. He sacrificed his own son to the Moabite god Chemosh
in the futile hope that his god would intervene. Yet, because he was a
false god, Chemosh did nothing. God, however, did not use this victory
to make the Moabites servants of Northern Israel. The Jews were so
appalled by this child sacrifice that they went home after the war was
over (2 Kgs. 3:27). The war was started by the pagan king Jehoram in an
effort to reassert control over a vassal state. God intervened because
of Elisha and Jehoshaphat. He did not intervene to force one pagan king
to pay tribute to another.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fulfillment of God’s prophesy of judgment against
Moab</u>. The Moabites symbolized the flesh. They were the offspring of
Moab, the eldest son in the incestuous union between Lot and his eldest
daughter. Their son was named Moab (Gen. 19:36-37). God previously
prohibited the Jews from encroaching upon Moabite territory because
Abraham gave them their lands (Dt. 2:8-9). Yet, the Moabites abused
God’s mercy and grace and instead embraced pagan idolatry. For this
reason, God judged them: “Woe to you, O Moab! You are ruined, O people
of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into
captivity, to an Amorite king, Sihon.” (Nu. 21:29). King Balak of Moab
hired a sorcerer named Balaam for the purpose of cursing the Jews (Nu.
22:1-5). God later prevented Balaam from cursing Israel (Nu. 23-24).
Yet, Balaam still wanted to earn the pay that Balak offered him (Nu.
22:17). He also knew that the Moabites were too afraid to fight the Jews
directly in battle (Nu. 22:3). He further knew that God was protecting
His people (Nu. 23:8). Just like the devil, Balaam knew that the only
way God’s people could be destroyed was if they voluntarily broke His
Law. Having them join with temple prostitutes was one rule he figured he
could induce them to break (Ex. 34:14-15; Dt. 23:17; Jdgs. 2:17; 1 Kgs.
14:22-24). Thus, he came up with a plan to have the Jews defile
themselves with the Moabite and Midianite woman (Nu. 22:4). He
instructed Balak to send his most attractive women to invite the Jewish
men to Moabite banquets (Nu. 31:16). The women then seduced the men
through acts of temple prostitution. The men would have had free sex
with the prostitutes in exchange for their agreement to first eat foods
sacrificed to Baal of Peor, the Canaanite fertility god, and then to
worship him. Although Balaam caused many Jews to die from God’s
judgment, he could not cause God to remove His protections over His
people. Because of both the Moabites’ idolatry and their acts against
the Jews, God revealed through a prophecy to Balaam that the Jews would
eventually rule over the Moabites (Nu. 24:17). Yet, God delayed His
judgment to give Moab a chance to repent. The Moabites, however, ignored
God’s warnings. In addition to practicing idolatry, they continued to
try to subjugate Israel. After the Jews invaded the Promised Land, King
Eglon of Moab invaded Israel and enslaved the Jews for 18 years (Jdgs.
3:12-14). God then raised up a deliverer named Ehud. Ehud traveled to
King Eglon under the pretext that he was delivering the Jews’ annual
tribute to the Moabites. Ehud then killed King Eglon with a hidden
dagger (Jdgs. 3:15-26). Through the example of Ehud’s faith, God granted
the Jews victory over the Moabites (Jdgs. 3:29-30). God not only judged
the Moabite king, He also judged all of Moab for its wickedness: “Woe to
you, Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished; for your sons have been
taken away captive and your daughters into captivity.” (Jer. 48:46).
David later partially fulfilled God’s warning of judgment against the
Moabites by conquering them (2 Sam. 8:2; 1 Chron. 18:2). Because the
Moabites continued in their wicked ways, God used the Jews again in this
war as His instrument of judgment.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Make no provision for the flesh</u>. If Moab symbolized the
flesh, the Jews made no provision for their flesh by leaving it.
Believers are also called upon to make no provision for the flesh. “But
put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in
regard to its lusts.” (Ro. 13:14). Are you denying the evil desires of
your flesh?</p></li>
