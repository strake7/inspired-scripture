<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the first of four chapters regarding the planning, building, and dedication of God’s Temple. This chapter explains how the Temple could not have been built without the help of tens of thousands of Jews and gentiles working together. Just as all had to work together then, God calls on every believer to be a co-builder of God’s Church (1 Cor. 3:9). Today, your body is the temple where the Holy Spirit resides (1 Cor. 6:19). Here, as directed by the Holy Spirit, God reveals seven lessons on how to fulfill your calling to be a co-builder of God’s Church.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, both King David and King Solomon witnessed a gentile king from Tyre in Lebanon obtain the materials needed to build God’s Temple. As a result, the two nations formed an alliance, and the gentile king became either a friend or believer in God. From the examples of David and Solomon, God reveals that His Church was meant to be a light to both believers and non-believers. <u>Second</u>, God chose Solomon to build the Temple because he was a man of peace. Solomon then sought out the strongest wood to ensure that it would be a strong refuge for all. From this, God reveals that His Church is meant to be a strong refuge of peace for all believers. <u>Third</u>, the gentile king from Tyre gave his people and resources out of gratitude and without seeking a reward. Through his example, God reveals that His Church is built upon the voluntary gratitude of believers. <u>Fourth</u>, the gentile king and king Solomon then formed a peace treaty. From their example, God reveals that His Church is built upon believers who act peaceably towards others. <u>Fifth</u>, to cut and move the wood and precious stones, thousands of people had to contribute with their God-given gifts. For this example, God reveals that His Church is built through each person using their gifts for Him. <u>Sixth</u>, the foundations of the Temple were laid with precious cornerstones. Jesus later revealed Himself to be the cornerstone. From this, God reveals that His Church is built with Jesus as its foundation and cornerstone. But many have rejected Him as their cornerstone. <u>Finally</u>, the creation and transport of the materials needed for the Temple required that Jews and gentiles work together. From their example, God reveals that His Church is built through united efforts of believers as directed by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<li><p><u>Solomon seeks to honor Yahweh’s “name” with King Hiram for their peace</u>. After receiving the blessing of God’s peace and His wisdom, Solomon reached out to a gentile ally to build a Temple to honor Yahweh’s “name” for their shared peace: “<sup>1</sup><em>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had always been a friend of David. <sup>2 </sup>Then Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying, <sup>3 </sup>‘You know that David my father was unable to build a house for the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God because of the wars which surrounded him, until the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> put them under the soles of his feet. <sup>4 </sup>But now the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.”</em> (1 Kgs. 5:1-4). The Phoenician King of Tyre in Southern Lebanon was David’s ally. His territory was part of the Promised Land. Yet, because he freely submitted to Yahweh’s rule under David, his country did not need to be conquered. Both countries then benefited from a shared peace. David also saw the King of Tyre as a friend of Yahweh and witnesses to him. As a gentile disciple of Yahweh, the King of Tyre previously gave David supplies to build David’s palace: “Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David.” (2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1). Here, the King of Tyre and King Solomon sought to renew the alliance between their countries. Both David and Solomon witnessed to this gentile king about God’s holiness. Both fulfilled the calling that God placed in their hearts for believers to witness to non-believers. Believers today are called to follow their example.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s Temple differed from pagan temples because He did not actually live there</u>. Solomon understood that he was building a Temple to honor God’s holy presence and “name”. He was not building an actual dwelling place for God. This was contrary to the common belief held by pagans regarding their pagan temples. David tried and failed to build the Temple (1 Kgs. 5:5). Until God rebuked him, David incorrectly believed that God needed for David to build an actual living place for Him (2 Sam. 7:1-3; 1 Chr. 17:1-2). God, however, was not someone whom David needed to pity or take care of. God’s real throne is in heaven, not on Earth. Thus, He did not need David to build Him a home. “Thus says the LORD, ‘Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool. Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest?’” (Is. 66:1; Acts 7:48-49). God cared more about selecting David and his descendants to rule over Israel than building His Temple on Earth: ‘“Since the day that I brought My people Israel from Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be over My people Israel.’” (1 Kgs. 8:16). Thus, God’s Temple was a place where His power and presence could be felt for believers to find fellowship with Him. It was not His literal residence.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Temple honored the power of the “name” of God</u>. In the Bible, a name was not only a means of identification. It expressed a person’s identity as well. “A good name is to be more desired than great riches.” (Prov. 22:1). When Solomon said he wanted to build a house for God’s “name” (1 Kgs. 5:3), he was referring to God’s holy presence. We see many examples of this in the Old Testament. For example, in two places in the Book of Genesis, Abraham called upon the “name of the Lord.” (Gen. 12:8; 13:4). In two other places, the term referred to an act of worship when someone called upon “the name” of the Lord (Gen. 21:33; 26:25). Likewise, on two occasions in the Book of Exodus, God proclaimed His “name” to Moses (Ex. 33:19; 34:5). Three times in the Book of Leviticus, He warned first the Jews and then the gentles not to profane “the name” of the Lord (Lev. 13:21; 22:2, 32). The Third Commandment also warns against taking “the name of the Lord in vain.” (Ex. 20:7; Dt. 5:11). In the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses also commanded the priests to minister in “the name” of the Lord (Dt. 18:5; 21:5). Joshua likewise called “the name” of God wonderful (Josh. 13:18). To fully know God’s “name” means that the person has put complete trust in all the Holy attributes of God to solve any problem or dilemma that the believer confronts: “The Lord also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble; and those <em>who know Your name will put their trust in You</em>, for You, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek You.” (Ps. 9:9-10). God will also protect His name: “<em>For the sake of My name</em> I delay My wrath.” (Is. 48:9). The Temple was the place where God’s people could come to know Him. Out of gratitude, the people could then worship Him in the Temple.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Like David and Solomon, be a light to non-believers around you</u>. Some mistakenly believe that the call to evangelism began in the New Testament. Yet, God originally called upon the Jews to be His light to the gentile nations around them: “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”’ (Is. 49:6). “For so the Lord has commanded us, ‘I have placed you as a light for the gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the end of the Earth.’” (Acts 13:47). David and Solomon fulfilled that calling by witnessing to the gentile King of Tyre. The King of Tyre showed that he was ready to accept God through his acts of tribute to build Yahweh’s Temple. Jesus is the “true light” (Jo. 1:9). He is also the Light of the World (Jo. 8:12). Like David and Solomon, are you sharing Jesus’ true light to non-believers around you? (Matt. 28:16-20).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon petitions King Hiram for cedar wood to build a strong Temple for Yahweh</u>. Solomon turned to his gentile friend to help build a Temple that would serve both Jews and gentiles: “<sup>5 </sup><em>Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he will build the house for My name.’ <sup>6 </sup>Now therefore, command that they cut for me cedars from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians</em>.”’ (1 Kgs. 5:5-6). This account is also included in the Book of Chronicles. There, Solomon is revealed to have asked for the same aid given to David so that he could complete the project: “Then Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, ‘As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, so do for me.”’ (2 Chr. 2:3). Phoenicians from the city of Sidon, located about 22 miles north of Tyre along the Mediterranean, cut the cedar timber because of their special skills (1 Kgs. 5:5-6). Like the people of Sidon, believers are called upon to use God’s talents to build His Church.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Temple symbolized God’s peace, and only Solomon, a man of peace, could build it</u>. Although David wanted to honor God by building a Temple, God would not allow him to do so: “Go and say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD, ‘Are you the one who should build Me a house to dwell in?”’’ (2 Sam. 7:5). As a man who constantly shed bloodshed through war, God determined that David was the wrong man to build the Temple of peace: “But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for My name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.”’ (1 Chr. 28:3). “But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘You have shed much blood and have waged great wars; you shall not build a house to My name, because you have shed so much blood on the earth before Me.”’ (1 Chr. 22:8). In contrast, Solomon was a man blessed with God’s peace and wisdom: “For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and <em>he had peace on all sides around about him</em>.” (1 Kgs. 4:24). “Behold, a son will be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and <em>I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days</em>.” (1 Chr. 22:9). Thus, as a man filled with God’s peace and wisdom, God told David that Solomon would be allowed to build His Temple. “<sup>12 </sup>When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>13 </sup>He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:12-13). “He said to me, ‘Your son Solomon is the one who shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a father to him.”’ (1 Chr. 28:6). Jesus came to fulfill God’s covenant through both David and Solomon. He is also the Son of David (Matt. 1:1). He is also the Son of Man (Matt. 8:20). He is further the Star of Jacob (Nu. 24:17), the Seed (Gen. 3:15), and He is the King of Kings, the ruler over all creation (1 Tim. 6:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the real Temple, and He offers the peace that surpasses all understanding</u>. Jesus is our Temple (Rev. 21:22). The Temple that Solomon built therefore was in honor of Jesus. God previously allowed for the Tabernacle to be built so that His Holy glory could be amongst God’s people: “Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.” (Ex. 40:34; Lev. 16:2; Nu. 7:89; 9:15-16). His presence later filled the Temple: “so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.” (1 Kgs. 8:11). God’s holy presence later became flesh through Jesus (Jo. 1:1, 14). Jesus is the Prince of Peace (Is. 9:6). He promises to leave believers with His true peace that surpasses all understanding: “Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.” (Col. 3:15). “For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:17). If your life is in turmoil, are you looking to Jesus for peace?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ Temple offers you peace because He is your refuge from conflict</u>. To ensure that the Temple would be strong, Solomon asked for “<em>cedar trees out of Lebanon</em>”. (1 Kgs. 5:6). The cedar trees from Lebanon were renowned for their strong and durable wood. They also symbolized Jesus’ majesty and might (Ps. 92:12; Ezek. 31:3). Like the mighty walls of the Temple, you can call Jesus “my salvation” (Ps. 18:2); “my strength” (Ps. 28:7; Jer. 16:19); “my shield” (Ps. 28:7; Gen. 15:1); “my deliverer . . . my merciful one, my fortress, my stronghold” (Ps. 144:2; Na. 1:7); the “strong tower” (Prov. 18:10); “fortress” (Jer. 16:19); “refuge” (Jer. 16:19); “our shade” (Ps. 121:5); “hiding place” (Ps. 32:7); “my savior,” (2 Sam. 22:3). Yet, He won’t impose His strength if you feel pride in your own strength. If you feel weary, humble yourself and let Jesus be your strength.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>King Hiram shares his praise for Yahweh and agrees to provide wood for the Temple</u>. When given the chance to help build the Temple, King Hiram showed himself to be a friend of God when he rejoiced, blessed God’s holy name, and immediately offered help: “<sup>7 </sup><em>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, ‘Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> today, who has given to David a wise son over this great people.’ <sup>8 </sup>So Hiram sent word to Solomon, saying, ‘I have heard the message which you have sent me; I will do what you desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber. <sup>9 </sup>My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place where you direct me, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall carry them away. Then you shall accomplish my desire by giving food to my household.’ <sup>10 </sup>So Hiram gave Solomon as much as he desired of the cedar and cypress timber. <sup>11 </sup>Solomon then gave Hiram 20,000 kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil; thus Solomon would give Hiram year by year</em>.” (1 Kgs. 5:7-11). King Hiram offered the best of what he had to serve the Lord. He gave without seeking a reward. God responded by rewarding his kingdom with abundant food and supplies (2 Chr. 2:10).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Rejoice and bless God’s holy name</u>. King Hiram showed himself to be either a believer or a friend of God. “<sup>7 </sup><em>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, ‘Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> today,</em>” (1 Kgs. 5:7). David also rejoiced and proclaimed: “I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul will make its boast in the LORD; the humble will hear it and rejoice.” (Ps. 34:1-2). Like Hiram and David, God wants you to rejoice and give thanks for the many times that He has delivered you from illness, sadness, defeat, fear, or an enemy: “in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;” (Eph. 5:20). Have you thanked God by blessing Him and rejoicing for His mercy and grace?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Gratefully give from the things God has given you</u>. After rejoicing, King Hiram offered the best that he had from his kingdom to aid in the building of the Temple. This included his God-given servants and wood (1 Kgs. 5:9-10). Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from above, even if someone in the world hands it to you: “Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.” (Jam. 1:17). God commands each believer to give back from the things that He has given. He in turn promises to bless you as a steward with more gifts (Mal. 3:8-10). Yet, He only wants you to give out of gratitude, not obligation (Ex. 36:2-7; 2 Cor. 9:6, 8-14). Satan will also seek to cause you to sin by keeping God’s tithes. The golden calf was Satan’s counterfeit offering (Ex. 32:2-6). Are you giving to God from what He has given you? Or, has your coveting robbed from resources that could be going to God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will also supply all that you need when you labor out of love for His Church</u>. After giving his people and natural resources to help build the Temple, Solomon blessed the people of Tyre with abundant food and supplies (1 Kgs. 5:7-11; 2 Chr. 2:10). Because Solomon wanted to serve God, God also blessed him with all the cedar that he needed (1 Kgs. 5:10). When you serve God, He promises to provide for all that you need: “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that always having all sufficiency in everything, <em>you may have an abundance for every good deed</em>;” (2 Cor. 9:8). “And <em>my God will supply all your needs</em> according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, <em>I shall not want</em>.” (Ps. 23:1). “O fear the LORD, you His saints; <em>for to those who fear Him there is no want</em>.” (Ps. 34:9). If you are missing anything, are you seeking to use your talents for yourself or for Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will give back in proportion to your giving to Him</u>. To the extent you give to God in faith, He will give back proportionally to you: “Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. <sup>7 </sup>Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:6-7). “And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings. <sup>10 </sup>“He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much. <sup>11 </sup>Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?” (Lk. 16:9-11). Are you giving to God faithfully from your time, talent, and treasure? Or, are you holding back?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When times are tough, test God by giving Him more than you can afford</u>. Giving is the one area where God encourages you to test Him. If you give to Him in faith, He promises to bless you with even more: <sup> </sup>“But you say, ‘How have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings. <sup>9 </sup>You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation of you! <sup>10 </sup>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts, ‘if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.’” (Mal. 3:8-10). Are you giving God the opportunity to bless you abundantly?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God blessed Solomon with both peace and wisdom</u>. Because Solomon and Hiram both acted in service to the Lord, God was faithful to bless them both: “<sup>12 </sup><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a covenant</em>.” (1 Kgs. 5:12). The two were united as one as they jointly served God. As a result, God blessed the people in both nations.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to bless Solomon with the wisdom needed to build the Temple</u>. The Bible records God’s faithfulness to bless Solomon with wisdom (1 Kgs. 5:12). God blessed Solomon with wisdom to fulfill His prior promise: “Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.” (1 Kgs. 3:12). Solomon’s “fame was known in all the surrounding nations.” (1 Kgs. 4:31). He then wisely used that fame to honor God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You also can trust in His promises to you</u>. The fulfillment of God’s promises to Solomon shows that you can also trust His promises for you as well. “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). He is faithful even when you are not (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you given thanks that you can trust in His faithfulness in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will bless the peacemakers</u>. God previously commanded the Jews not to make any covenants or treaties with the people of Canaan (Ex. 23:32; Dt. 7:2). Yet, they could make treaties with foreign nations (Dt. 20:10-15). This included the people of Tyre. At a time when permitted, Abraham and the Canaanite Abimelech made a similar covenant of peace (Gen. 21:25-34). Like Solomon, Hiram, Abraham, and Abimelech, you are commanded to be at peace with others whenever possible. “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.” (Ro. 12:18). “Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” (Mark 9:50). If you stay at peace with others around you, Jesus promises to bless you: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.” (Matt. 5:9). Are you a peacemaker to those in conflict around you? If you quarrel and fight or cause conflict with others, what kind of witness for Christ are you?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon sends the laborers to bring the supplies for the Temple</u>. Solomon divided 30,000 forced laborers into three groups that went in rotating relay teams to deliver the wood. An even larger group cut and brought the stones for the Temple: “<sup>13 </sup><em>Now King Solomon levied forced laborers from all Israel; and the forced laborers numbered 30,000 men. <sup>14 </sup>He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in relays; they were in Lebanon a month and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the forced laborers</em>. “<sup>15 </sup><em>Now Solomon had 70,000 transporters, and 80,000 hewers of stone in the mountains, <sup>16 </sup>besides Solomon’s 3,300 chief deputies who were over the project and who ruled over the people who were doing the work.</em>” (1 Kgs. 5:13-16). When the Jews demanded a king, Samuel warned that it was against God’s will and would result in people being conscripted into forced labor (1 Sam. 8:11-17). This practice would later become a source of conflict for the northern tribes (1 Kgs. 12:4). Yet, for now, the Jews did not complain because they labored together for God’s glory. Even though 30,000 Jews were conscripted into service, Solomon wisely ensured that they were treated fairly. With his system of rotation, each group of 10,000 worked only four months per year. They worked one month and then had two months off. This allowed them to tend to their own crops or other industries. In addition, 70,000 others transported stone, and 80,000 people carried stones from the mountains (1 Kgs. 5:15). The workers were also supervised to make sure that they were treated fairly. Solomon picked Adoniram to supervise the forced laborers (1 Kgs. 5:14). He was also responsible for collecting the tribute or the tax (1 Kgs. 4:6). This means that Solomon picked a wise and trusted leader to supervise the workers. The other 150,000 non-Jewish laborers had 3,300 non-Jewish supervisors to oversee them (1 Kgs. 5:16; 2 Chr. 2:17-18). Jewish supervisors might have mistreated the non-Jewish workers. God did not want His Temple built using evil labor practices.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Use your talents for His glory</u>. God has given you talents for you to use as a co-builder of His Church (Matt. 25:14-30). If you are faithful with the small things that He gives you, He will entrust you with greater things: “As <em>each one has received a special gift</em>, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. ” (1 Pet. 4:10). “Since <em>we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us</em>, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.” (Ro. 12:6-8). “And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, <sup>12</sup> for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;” (Eph. 4:11-12). “Now concerning <em>spiritual</em> <em>gifts</em>, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. . . . <sup>.4</sup> Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup>5</sup> And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord. <sup>6</sup> There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons. <sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” (1 Cor. 12:1-7). Are you using your gifts for Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Every laborer is needed</u>. An incredible number of people were needed to build the Temple. Every person’s gift is needed in the body of Christ because no one person has them all (1 Cor. 12:13-27). Moses could not have built the Tabernacle on his own. Solomon also could not build the Temple on his own. Christ also wants you to be His laborer (Col. 3:23). Are you laboring for His glory or your own?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Make your life a living sacrifice for God</u>. God wants you to tithe your life as a “living sacrifice” to Him: “Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). Are you giving God the best of your time, talent, and treasure?</p></li>

<li><p><u>Solomon used costly stones for the foundation of the Temple</u>. Solomon used only the best materials and stones in building the Temple: “<em><sup>17 </sup>Then the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones</em>.” (1 Kgs. 5:17). Each stone was carefully cut and polished. The stones were also transported miles by hand. Each stone had to then carefully fit together to support the Temple. The costly and precious stones used for the Temple all foreshadowed Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus was the cornerstone of the Temple</u>. Like the cornerstones used to build the Temple, Jesus is the cornerstone of the Church: “having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,” (Eph. 2:20). “Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, ‘Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone, A costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed. He who believes in it will not be disturbed.”’ (Is. 28:16). “For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Cor. 3:11). Nothing we do without Him will last.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Although He is everyone’s cornerstone, many sadly rejected Him</u>. The psalms prophetically warn that God’s people would one day reject their chief cornerstone: “The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.” (Ps. 118:22). Jesus revealed that He is the rejected cornerstone: “Jesus said to them, ‘Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief cornerstone; this came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” (Matt. 21:42; Mk. 12:10; Lk. 20:17; Acts 4:11). “just as it is written, ‘Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense, and he who believes in Him will not be disappointed.”’ (Ro. 9:33). “And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,” (1 Pet. 2:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus be your cornerstone</u>. After the Temple was destroyed, the Holy Spirit now resides in believers (1 Cor. 3:16-17). Thus, Jesus should be the foundation of your life. If He is, you will be able to handle any tragedy or storm in life: “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25). Is He your Rock and support system in times of distress?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon works in unity with the gentiles to build a Temple of praise for Yahweh</u>. Both Jews and gentiles then worked closely together to prepare for the building of God’s Temple: “<sup>18 </sup><em>So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house</em>.” (1 Kgs. 5:18). The Gebalites came from a town approximately 60 miles north of Tyre. Because God is the God of every living creation, it was important that both Jews and gentiles work together to build His Temple. In the end times, both Jews and gentiles will worship there together.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient in God’s call to serve Him</u>. God calls every believer by name to do good works for Him: “For we are His workmanship, <em>created in Christ Jesus for good works</em>, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10). “Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, <em>prepared for every good work</em>.” (2 Tim. 2:21). God has not called you to be a spectator. If you don’t know your calling, you should pray for Him to reveal it (Jam. 1:5). Are you being obedient in God’s calling in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Work together as one body for Jesus</u>. Just as the Jews and gentiles had to work in unity to build God’s Temple, believers are called upon to act with one accord as the Spirit leads the body to help build the Church. “For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.” (1 Cor. 3:9). “so we, who are many, <em>are one body in Christ</em>, and individually members one of another.” (Ro. 12:5). “Since there is one bread, we who are many are <em>one body</em>; for we all partake of the one bread.” (1 Cor. 10:17). “For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are <em>one body</em>, so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12). “But now there are many members, but <em>one body</em>. And the eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; or again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’” (1 Cor. 12:20-21). “There is <em>one body</em> and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;” (Eph. 4:4). Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.” (Col. 3:14). Are you preparing for service and then responding for duty when God calls you to serve?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jews and gentile believers in Jesus will one day worship Him together</u>. During the Millennial Reign when God’s perfect rule is restored, the Bible says that people will worship Jesus together in the restored Temple: “‘from Sabbath to Sabbath, all mankind will come to bow down before Me,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord.”</span> (Is. 66:22-23; Ez. 20:12-26). Thus, you should never look at a Jew as a rejected member of God’s people. He wants to save them all. Yet, many are waiting for someone like you to share the Gospel with them.</p></li>
