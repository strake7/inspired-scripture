<p>Psalm 24: Seven Revelations Regarding Jesus Christ, the Promised King of Glory</p>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: For many, Psalm 24 does not rank amongst most famous Psalms, but it should. Here, David asked who can be in God’s presence. He stated that the person needs to be pure before God. This person must also restore God’s fallen people to be in His holy presence. At the end of the Psalm, David reveals that this is person is not a mere mortal. Instead, this person is God Himself, “<em>the King of glory</em>” (Ps. 24:8). In other words, for the first time, David revealed the Messiah to be more than a mere human – He is God. In Psalm 22, the Messiah is described as the Suffering Servant. In Psalm 23, He is described as the Shepherd of God’s people. Here, He is described according the glory that He deserves and what He will receive in heaven for what He has done for His people. Thus, in the conclusion to these three Psalms, the Messiah is described according to seven of His glorious attributes. These include: (1) sovereignty, (2) omnipotence, (3) holiness, (4) righteousness, (5) grace, (6) salvation, and (7) divine majesty.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, before revealing the identity of the King of Glory, David stated the entire Earth and every nation belongs to God. The King of Glory is sovereign over the Earth and every nation. Jesus is in ultimate control over every thing and person. <u>Second</u>, David then explained why God is sovereign. He created all things. The King of Glory is all-powerful, the Creator of everything. Everything was created through Jesus. <u>Third</u>, David stated that no person could stand in God’s holy presence. The King of Glory is holy, a consuming fire against sin. Jesus will one day judge all sin. <u>Fourth</u>, David described the One who can stand in God’s presence, a person pure in both thought and deed. The King of Glory is righteous, pure, and without sin. This describes Jesus. <u>Fifth</u>, David declared that God would bless the One with the righteousness to stand in His presence. The King of Glory is blessed, but He is gracious to share His blessings. Jesus wants to share His authority and blessings with you. <u>Sixth</u>, after introducing the Righteous One, David then stated that a generation of the people of the God of Jacob will one be day able to see God face to face. The King of Glory will save His people to restore them with God the Father. Jesus died for our sins so that any who believe can be saved and reconciled with God the Father in heaven. <u>Finally</u>, David declares that there will be intense worship when the King of Glory enters triumphantly into Jerusalem. He then reveals the King of Glory to be God. Jesus was God. He will be worshipped as His Shekinah Glory enters the New Jerusalem as our divine, eternal King.</p>
<p>1. <u>Sovereignty: The King of Glory is Sovereign Over the Earth and Every Nation</u>. Ps. 24:1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God as the ruler of the entire Earth</u>. Although Israel was a small nation surrounded by greater powers, David praised Yahweh as the ruler of the entire Earth: “<em>The King of Glory Entering Zion. A Psalm of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>The earth is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span>, and all it contains, the world, and those who live in it</em>.” (Ps. 24:1). The New American Standard Bible adds to the Title “<em>The King of Glory Entering Zion</em>.” Everything within this Psalm reveals who He is. Among his many attributes, He is sovereign over all.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign over the entire Earth</u>. Paul later repeated David’s praise in the New Testament: “The earth is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span>, and all it contains,” (1 Cor. 10:26). Everything in heaven or on Earth belongs to God alone: “Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.” (Dt. 10:14). “‘ . . . the thunder will cease and there will no longer be hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD’S.”’ (Ex. 9:29). “ . . . for all the earth is Mine;” (Ex. 19:5 <sup>b</sup>). “Whatever is under the entire heaven is Mine.” (Job 41:11b). “For the world is Mine, and everything it contains.” (Ps. 50:12b). There is no one with power comparable to His power: “Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,” (Is. 46:9). Thus, He is worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign over every nation and person on Earth</u>. David also made clear that God’s authority extends over not just the Earth, but also “<em>those who live in it</em>.” (Ps. 24:1). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” (Ps. 10:16). Daniel later explained: “It is He [God] who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.” (Da. 2:21). “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23). “Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.” (Is. 40:15). “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17). “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; . . .” (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35). Even when evil surrounds you or when you are ruled by evil leaders, do you trust that God is still in ultimate control?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you walk with God, you never need to fear Satan</u>. Satan has temporary authority on the Earth because of original sin: “in whose case <em>the god of this world</em> has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Cor. 4:4). He tried to bargain with Jesus by offering all the kingdoms of Earth if only Jesus would bow before him (Matt. 4:8-9). Jesus rebuked Satan (Matt. 4:10). He is no match for Jesus’ power: “Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” (Jo. 12:31). “ . . . because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4b). In the Book of Job, God set the limits for Satan’s attacks on Job. God also controls any test that you may receive. He will never give you a test that you cannot handle. He also controls the timing and duration of any test. You may not know your true limits, but God does.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He is sovereign over all</u>. Because Jesus is in control and causes all things to work together for His greater good (Ro. 8:28), He deserves your praise: “whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, <em>who is over all</em>, <em>God blessed forever</em>. Amen.” (Ro. 9:5). “Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said, ‘LORD, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.”’ (2 Kgs. 19:15).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <u>Omnipotence: The King of Glory is All Powerful, the Creator of Everything</u>. Ps. 24:2.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed that God owns the Earth because He created it</u>. While many in David’s time turned to false pagan gods, David stated that God is sovereign and worthy of praise because He alone created the Earth, the seas, the dry land and all life: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers</em>.” (Ps. 24:2). The starlight confirms the glory of His creation: “The heavens tell of the glory of God; and their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). Those who look at the beauty of nature and deny God’s creation will be without excuse when they one day stand before Him at the throne of judgment: “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse.” (Ro. 1:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God created the Earth, the seas, the dry lands, and all life within it</u>. God’s creation of the Earth, the seas, the dry lands, and all life within it is proclaimed in the book of Genesis: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. . .” (Gen. 1:1-31). The great prophets regularly praised God for creation: “You alone are the LORD. You have made the heavens, the heaven of heavens with all their lights, the earth and everything that is on it, the seas and everything that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly lights bow down before You.” (Neh. 9:6). “The sea is His, for it was He who made it, and His hands formed the dry land.” (Ps. 95:5; 146:6; Jonah 1:9). “And when they heard this, they raised their voices to God with one mind and said, ‘Lord, it is You who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything that is in them,”’ (Acts 4:24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the Creator of all things</u>. The New Testament reveals that all things were created through Jesus: “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.” (Jo. 1:3). “for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Col. 1:16). “yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist through Him.” (1 Cor. 8:6). Thus, He is worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus had the power to create the universe, there is nothing He cannot do</u>. There is no problem in your life that is too big for Jesus: “Is anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14a). “‘Oh, Lord GOD! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,” (Jer. 32:17). “And looking at them, Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26; Mk. 10:27; Lk. 18:27). He uses His power to bless you: “May you be blessed of the LORD, Maker of heaven and earth.” (Ps. 115:15). Thus, He is again worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the faithful Creator of the universe, who is sovereign over everything</u>. The psalmist worshiped God as the creator of all life: “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.” (Ps. 115:15). “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 124:8). “May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 134:3). Nehemiah also led the Jews in worshiped for the Creator who gave them life (Neh. 9:6). In heaven, you will be also praising Jesus for His creation: “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” (Rev. 4:11). “and he said with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth, and sea and springs of waters.”’ (Rev. 14:7). He again is worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <u>Holiness: The King of Glory is Holy, A Consuming Fire Against Sin</u>. Ps. 24:3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed that God is holy, and none are worthy to stand before Him</u>. In addition to being sovereign and omnipotent, David stated that God is holy, and none have the right to stand before Him because of their sins: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Who may ascend onto the hill of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? And who may stand in His holy place</em>?” (Ps. 24:3). How to reconcile mankind in its sinful state with its holy Creator was a question that David had previously asked: “A Psalm of David. <sup>1</sup> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who may reside in Your tent? Who may settle on Your holy hill?” (Ps. 15:1). He twice asked this same question because dwelling with God was his greatest desire: “One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: <em>That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life</em>, to behold the beauty of the LORD and to meditate in His temple.” (Ps. 27:4). “For a day in Your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than live in the tents of wickedness.” (Ps. 84:10). This should be your greatest desire as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is holy</u>. The Bible declares that God is holy. Thus, He expects His people to be holy as well: “For I am the LORD your God . . . be holy, for I am holy.” (Lev. 11:44). “Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.” (Lev. 19:2). “You are to be my holy people.” (Ex. 22:31). “for it is written: ‘Be holy, because I am holy.’” (1 Pet. 1:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Sin has separated us from God’s holiness</u>. Because God is holy, our sins have separated us from Him: “But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God . . .” (Is. 59:2(a)). God has looked down from heaven and observed that not one person is holy and without sin: “[I]t is written, ‘There is none righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.”’ (Ro. 3:10-11). “[T]here is no one who does good.” (Ps. 14:1; 53:1). “Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.” (Ps. 143:2). God gave Solomon great wisdom (1 Kgs. 3:11-12). But even with his great wisdom, he could not keep himself from sinning: “Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins.” (Ecc. 7:20). “Who can say, ‘I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin’?” (Prov. 20:9). Paul later quoted from Solomon to preach universal sin and mankind’s need for salvation (Ro. 3:23). Only those whom God has made pure will be able to see Him: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matt. 5:8). And, “[i]f we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” (1 Jo. 1:8). If you could get to heaven because of our good works, Jesus’ death was unnecessary (Gal. 2:21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus, the King of Glory, will one day judge the nations who reject Him</u>. Because God is holy, no sin can be in His presence: “for our God is a consuming fire.” (Heb. 12:29; 10:27; Ex. 24:17; Dt. 4:24; 9:3; Ps. 97:3; Is. 33:14; 2 Thess. 1:7). Thus, no one should treat sin lightly (Ro. 6:26). “For the wages of sin is death, . .” (Ro. 6:23). When Jesus returns as the King of Glory, He will also judge the nations: “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>And all the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>and He will put the sheep on His right, but the goats on the left.” (Matt. 25:31-33). Like David, everyone should ask the same question - - how can we dwell in His holy presence?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Only Jesus can make you holy to be in God the Father’s presence</u>. Because He had faith, David knew that God would find a way to allow him to dwell with God forever: “<em>my dwelling will be in the house of the LORD forever</em>.” (Ps. 23:6b). Through faith in Jesus, all are guaranteed the same promise of eternal life with God in heaven (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy by letting Jesus cleanse your sins</u>. Because God is holy, He again expects you to be holy before Him as well (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7). So that you can become holy, Jesus began His public ministry with a call to repentance. “From that time Jesus began to preach and say, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”’ (Matt. 4:17). Jesus came “saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”’ (Mk. 1:15). His disciples also began their ministry with a call to repentance: “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”’ (Acts 2:38). If you say that you are without sin, the Bible says that the truth is not in you (1 Jo. 1:8). Yet, if you confess your sins, Jesus promises to forgive your sins: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). What sins do you need to repent of?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His Holy name</u>. The Jews praised God for His holy name: “<em>bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God forever and ever! May Your glorious name be blessed and exalted above all blessing and praise!</em>” (Neh. 9:5). The psalmist also blessed God’s holy name: “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19). “Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; bring an offering and come into His courts.” (Ps. 96:8). “Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.” (Ps. 115:1). David also praised God’s holy name: “that Your name may be magnified forever,” (2 Sam. 7:26). Jesus also began the Lord’s prayer by declaring God’s name to be holy (Matt. 6:9) Do your prayers also include blessings and praises for God’s name?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <u>Righteousness: The King of Glory is Also Righteous, Pure, and Without Sin</u>. Ps. 24:4.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised the Messiah for being righteous and able to dwell with God</u>. David stated that there was only One who was clean of heart and could dwell with God, the Messiah: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>One who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to deceit and has not sworn deceitfully</em>.” (Ps. 24:4). David knew that he could not make himself pure. Thus, his words looked forward to the Messiah, who was pure and without sin. The New Testament reveals that the Righteous One was and is Jesus Christ.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because He is righteous and sinless, Jesus allows mankind to be holy before God</u>. Only God is righteous: “They will say of Me, ‘<em>Only in the LORD are righteousness and strength</em>.’” (Is. 45:25a). Through His righteousness alone, God promised to provide a way for His people to be made holy: “In those days <em>Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety</em>; and <em>this is the name by which it will be called: the LORD is our righteousness</em>.’” (Jer. 33:16). Jesus fulfilled this prophesy. He was and is “<em>unblemished and spotless</em>” (1 Pet. 1:17-19). Because He had never known sin and was righteous, He was an acceptable sacrifice with our sins being placed upon Him: “<em>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf</em>, so that <em>we might become the righteousness of God in Him</em>.” (2 Cor. 5:21). “[I]t is <em>the</em> <em>righteousness</em> of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe;. . . whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. <em>This was to demonstrate His righteousness</em> . . . <em>of His righteousness</em> at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” (Ro. 3:22, 25-26). “He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and <em>live to righteousness</em>; for by His wounds you were healed.” (1 Pet. 2:24). “But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, and by His scourging we are healed.” (Is. 53:5). Thus, He paid a terrible price at the cross to make you righteous (1 Cor. 6:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Allow Jesus to cleanse your heart and make you holy</u>. Because David desired to be cleansed and made holy, he cried out: “Create in me a clean heart, God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” (Ps. 51:10). Are you calling on Jesus to cleanse you as well?</p></li>
<li><p><u>As Jesus’ ambassador, walk with righteousness and integrity</u>. David states that a person who is made righteous no longer walks in “<em>deceit</em>” (Ps. 24:4). If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you should not take His sacrifice for you for granted. You are now Jesus’ ambassador (2 Cor. 5:22), and you represent His light (Matt. 5:14). Thus, He calls upon you to try to be blameless and righteous: “so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ; having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” (Phil. 1:11). “If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;” (1 Jo. 1:6). Do your actions reflect fairly upon Jesus’ righteousness? Or, do you cast him in a bad light?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <u>Grace: The King of Glory is Blessed, and is Gracious to Share His Blessings</u>. Ps. 24:5.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed that God would bless the Righteous One</u>. The Righteous One with the purity of heart to ascend before God will also receive God’s blessings: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>He will receive a blessing from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and righteousness from the God of his salvation</em>.” (Ps. 24:5). God the Father blessed Jesus for His faith and righteousness. Out of grace, Jesus will now bless all those who believe in Him and seek to do His will, as led by the Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God the Father blessed Jesus, and Jesus offers to share His blessings</u>. Jesus is the Righteous One that David wrote about (Ps. 24:5). Through His death, all can be made righteous to dwell in heaven. For His faithful obedience, God the Father blessed Jesus with full authority in heaven and on Earth: “And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.”’ (Matt. 28:18; Phil. 2:9; Col. 2:10; Heb. 1:2; 1 Pet. 3:22; 1 Cor. 15:27). Out of grace, Jesus now offers to share His authority with you: “Behold, <em>I have given you authority</em> to walk on snakes and scorpions, and <em>authority over all the power of the enemy</em>, and nothing will injure you.” (Lk. 10:19). “for <em>His divine power has granted to us</em> everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Pet. 1:3). “It was for this He called you through our gospel, that <em>you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>.” (2 Thess. 2:14). You cannot demand this blessing through your works. Instead, out of grace, He shares His blessings with you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God promises to bless those who fear Him and follow His Word with the right motives</u>. Through David, God only promised to bless those who feared Him and obeyed Him. By fearing God, the person understood that God’s blessing were based upon grace and not something that a person could demand as the price for their obedience: “Praise the LORD! Blessed is a person who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.” (Ps. 112:1). “He will bless those who fear the LORD, the small together with the great.” (Ps. 115:13). “Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in His ways.” (Ps. 128:1). The fear of the Lord is defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:13). God is unlikely to reward someone who has a feeling of entitlement from Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers eternal salvation as the best reward for your faith</u>. Jesus gave His life so that all who have faith in Him might live: “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Ro. 5:8). “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” (Jo. 10:11). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). His blood is the symbol and proof of His covenant. “And He said to them, ‘This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.’” (Mk. 14:24; Lk. 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25; Jer. 31:31). What Jesus offers is also free (Ro. 6:26). His reward only requires your faith that He died on the cross for your sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of grace, Jesus will also reward your faith on Earth and in heaven</u>. In addition to the reward of eternal life, Jesus also promises to bless you in many other ways. He promises to bless you with the Holy Spirit as a down-payment on your salvation (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22). And, in addition to blessings on Earth through the Spirit, He promises five kinds of crowns in heaven. <em>First</em>, those who persevere in the face of trials will receive a crown of life: “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive <em>the crown of life</em> which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.” (Ja. 1:12; ; Rev. 2:10). <em>Second</em>, those who live a pure life while waiting for His return will receive a crown of righteousness: “in the future there is laid up for me the <em>crown of righteousness</em>, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.” (2 Tim. 4:8). <em>Third</em>, those who exercise self-control will receive an “<em>incorruptible crown</em>” (1 Cor. 9:25-27). <em>Fourth</em>, elders, pastors, teachers, leaders, and shepherds of God’s flock will also receive “<em>a crown of glory</em>” (1 Pet. 5:4). <em>Finally</em>, those who help lead others to Christ will receive a “<em>crown of rejoicing</em>” (1 Thess. 2:19; ). Jesus also promised various conditional blessings in the beatitudes (Matt. 5:1-12). He also promised “rewards” for those who store up their treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:20). These are among the examples of blessings that are unrelated to your salvation. Other kinds of rewards on Earth include a prolonged life (Dt. 5:32-33). Have you given thanks for Jesus’ many undeserved gifts in your life and the many undeserved gifts that await you in heaven?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <u>Salvation: The King of Glory Will Save His People to Restore Them With God</u>. Ps. 24:6.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David foretold of a holy generation who could see God’s face</u>. David then switched from describing the Righteous One to what He will do for a future generation of the Covenant people of the God of Jacob – they will see God’s face: “<strong><sup>6</sup></strong> <em>This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face—even Jacob. Selah</em>” (Ps. 24:6). Although verse six is missing a transition word or phrase, one commentator explains that it again refers to the Messiah: “Psalm 24 seems to indicate that the surpassing righteousness of the man who is worthy will bring about a righteous generation who is like him. David knows that his own righteousness is only relative (see his confession of sin in, e.g., 19:12-13), so when he speaks of this man who has innocent hands and a pure heart he seems to describe someone who has risen above the sinful status of humanity. . . While the details are not worked out in full, Ps 24:3-6 indicates that the generation that seeks Yahweh’s face will be made righteous by the one who has the right to ascend Yahweh’s mountain and stand in Yahweh’s holy place.” (James M. Hamilton Jr., <em>Evangelical Bible Theology Commentary Psalms</em> (Vol. I: Psalms 1-72) (Lexham Academic 2021) p. 305).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to provide a way to restore His Covenant people</u>. God promised that He will never forget His Covenant with His people: “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). He also would not forsake the Jews when He disciplined them (Lev. 26:44-45). Thus, He exhorted them to have faith: “Be strong and courageous, . . . He will not fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6). God will also never leave or forsake you (Heb. 13:5). He provided a path through Jesus to restore His Covenant people. As an heir to Abraham’s Covenant, this is available to you as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus loves you and died so that you could dwell in eternal fellowship with Him</u>. Out of love for mankind, Jesus first came and dwelled with us as a human. He then died at the cross so that any who believe could live: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Ro. 5:8). “He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.” (Ro. 4:25). Like the Jews, you too are called to seek fellowship with Jesus: “God is faithful, through whom <em>you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord</em>.” (1 Cor. 1:9). Without His fellowship, your peace will be only temporary and easily broken (Eph. 2:13-15; Ro. 5:1). When you are in fellowship with Him, He offers the “peace that surpasses all understanding.” (Phil. 4:7). Thus, every believer should seek out His fellowship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to seek out spiritual intimacy with Him</u>. God once spoke to Moses “<em>face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend</em>. . .” (Ex. 33:11a). David used this as his analogy when he wrote that restoration would come for those “<em>who seek Your face.</em>” (Ps. 24:6). This was something that David committed to doing: “When You said, ‘<em>Seek My face</em>,’ my heart said to You, ‘<em>I shall seek Your face, LORD</em>.”’ (Ps. 27:8). David encouraged others to do the same: “Seek the LORD and His strength; <em>seek His face continually</em>.” (1 Chr. 16:11; Ps. 105:4). Jesus also encouraged believers to seek His spiritual intimacy, symbolized by dining together with Him: ‘“Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, <em>I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me</em>.”’ (Rev. 3:20). “Come close to God and He will come close to you.” (Jam. 4:8a). Jesus offers His fellowship so that you can find true peace and fulfillment through Him (Jo. 16:33). Being saved is just the first step to being a Christian. If you want to seek out fellowship with Him, you must accept His knock on the door of your heart. Are you actively seeking out Jesus’ fellowship?</p></li>

<p>7. <u>Majesty: The King of Glory Will Be Praised and Worshipped in Heaven</u>. Ps. 24:7-10.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David revealed that the King of Glory is God Himself</u>. Without a full understanding of the Triune God, David revealed that the Messiah and King of Glory was in fact God: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Lift up your heads, you gates, and be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in! <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Who is the King of glory? The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> strong and mighty, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> mighty in battle. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Lift up your heads, you gates, and lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in! <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Who is this King of glory? The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of armies, He is the King of glory. Selah</em>” (Ps. 24:7-10). “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of armies</em> (Ps. 24:10) will first vanquish all evil: “Your right hand, O LORD, has become <em>glorious in power</em>; Your right hand, O LORD, has dashed the enemy in pieces.” (Ex. 15:6). He will then enter heaven through the Lord’s gate (Ps. 24:11), which is reserved for the righteous: “This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous will enter through it.” (Ps. 118:20). The honor that the King of Kings will receive upon entering heaven is repeated for emphasis.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God promised that the King of Glory would come through David’s line</u>. God repeatedly promised that the Messiah would inherit an eternal kingship that would come through David’s line: “<sup>11 </sup> . . . I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>12 </sup><em>He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever</em>.” (1 Chr. 17:11-12; 2 Sam. 7:13). ‘“He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.”’ (1 Chr. 22:10). ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.’ Selah.” (Ps. 89:4). “He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” (Ps. 18:50). “I also shall make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 89:27). “For thus says the LORD, ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;”’ (Jer. 33:17). “For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore.” (Is. 9:6-7a). “A throne will even be established in lovingkindness, and a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David; moreover, <em>he will seek justice and be prompt in righteousness</em>.” (Is. 16:5). “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘When I will raise up for David <em>a righteous Branch</em>; and <em>He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land</em>. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely; and this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our righteousness.’”’ (Jer. 23:5-6). He would also be the King of Glory: “So I will establish his descendants forever and <em>his throne as the days of heaven</em>.” (Ps. 89:29).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus was the fulfillment of God’s promised King of Glory</u>. Jesus was born into the line of David (Matt. 1:1). He came to fulfill God’s covenant with David as the eternal King of Kings: “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.’” (Rev. 19:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus revealed His glory on Earth, but many failed to understand it</u>. The glory of God the Father was also revealed through Jesus Christ: “And the Word became flesh . . . and <em>we saw His glory</em>, glory as the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (Jo. 1:14). But only those with faith could see that Jesus was light of the world (Jo. 8:12). Most could not comprehend His light because they loved evil (Jo. 3:19). “in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that <em>they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ</em>, who is the image of God.” (2 Cor. 4:4). Thus, they crucified Him: “the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified <em>the Lord of glory</em>;” (1 Cor. 2:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reveal His full glory to all in heaven</u>. After Jesus returns, His Shekinah glory will again be present in the Temple (Micah 4:1-8; Zech. 14:3-9). In heaven, you will also see His Shekinah glory without the need for a veil (1 Jo. 3:2). You “<em>will see His face. . . [and] the Light of God (“Shekinah glory”) will illumine them forever and ever</em>.” (Rev. 22:5). “And <em>He is the radiance of His glory</em> and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, <em>He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</em>,” (Heb. 1:3). “LORD, I love the dwelling of Your house, and the place <em>where Your glory remains</em>.” (Ps. 26:8). “Be exalted above the heavens, God; may <em>Your glory be above all the earth</em>.” (Ps. 57:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Psalm 24 records the glorious applause that we will give Jesus as the King of Glory</u>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people">British</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism">evangelist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon">preacher</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_scholar">Bible teacher</a>, and author Dr. George Campbell Morgan (1863 – 1945) once observed that Psalm 24 is the culmination of the more well-known Psalms 22 and 23: “By our calendars, yesterday He passed through <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+22&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 22</a>. Today, He is exercising the office of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+23&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 23</a>. Tomorrow, He will exercise finally the authority of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+24&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 24</a>.” (Quoted by David Guzik on Ps. 24). Psalm 24 also suggest a time when believers will be gathered together in the New Jerusalem to greet the King of Glory as He enters to rapturous applause. It will be like nothing anyone has ever experienced. “The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare; and in His temple everything says, “<em>Glory</em>!” (Ps. 29:9). “The heavens declare His righteousness, and <em>all the peoples have seen His glory</em>.” (Ps. 97:6). “One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, <em>to behold the beauty of the LORD and to meditate in His temple</em>.” (Ps. 27:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the King of Glory</u>. One of the best worship songs for the King of Glory is the song “Hosanna” from New Zealand singer and song writer Brooke Gabrielle Fraser Ligertwood: “Come on, we sing, I see the King of glory coming on the clouds with fire, the whole Earth shakes, the whole Earth shakes, Yeah, I see His love and mercy, washing over all our sin, the people sing , the people sing, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, I see a generation, rising up to take their place, with selfless faith, with selfless faith, I see a near revival, stirring as we pray and seek, we’re on our knees, we’re on our knees, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest , Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Heal my heart and make it clean, open up my eyes to the things unseen, show me how to love like You have loved me , break my heart for what breaks Yours , everything I am for Your kingdom’s cause as I walk from Earth into eternity, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest . . .”</p></li>
