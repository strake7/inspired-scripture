<p><strong>Psalm 73: Lessons for Overcoming Feelings of Envy and Doubt</strong></p>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 73 begins the third book of Psalms. Asaph, its author, was a chief worship leader under both David and Solomon (1 Chron. 6:39; 15:17; 16:5; 2 Chron. 5:12). Twelve psalms are credited to him (Ps. 50, 73-83). He was so influential that his descendants led worship for generations. For example, when Josiah instituted reforms after generations of spiritual decline, he looked to Asaph’s descendants and others to lead the Jews in worship (2 Chr. 35:15). But book three begins with Asaph having a Job-like crisis of faith. He suffered while he observed wicked people enjoying plentiful lives. He felt envy and doubt. But he turned to God and overcame his feelings. From this psalm, God reveals seven lessons for when you feel envy and doubt. When you experience these feelings, God wants you to: (1) purify your heart, (2) be patient, (3) trust Him, (4) worship Him, (5) repent, (6) be grateful, and (7) be content.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Asaph admitted that his envy nearly caused him to stumble in his walk. But he praised God and proclaimed that God will bless the pure in heart. When you feel envy or doubt, God will also bless you when you ask Him to purify your heart of worldly desires. <u>Second</u>, Asaph lamented that the wicked appeared to be blessed, even while they mocked God. Life at times feels unfair. When things feel unfair to you, God wants you to be patient for His timing. <u>Third</u>, Asaph marveled how many sinners doubted whether God paid attention to their sins. While these people prospered, he suffered. When things feel unfair to you, God wants you to place your trust in His sovereignty. Even when evil temporarily prevails, He is in control and has a plan. <u>Fourth</u>, Asaph overcame his feelings of doubt and envy when he turned to God in worship in His sanctuary. When things feel unfair, God also wants you to find comfort and understanding through worship. <u>Fifth</u>, Asaph confessed that he had foolishly envied wicked people. He realized that their abundance was only temporary. When you envy worldly things, God also wants you to confess your sins so that He can transform your thinking. <u>Sixth</u>, Asaph was grateful that God would support and guide him despite his sinful and doubting nature. When you feel envy, doubt, or when things feel unfair, be grateful for God’s mercy and grace in your life. <u>Finally</u>, Asaph proclaimed that he would praise God to others and find contentment in God’s provision. When you feel envy or doubt, God also wants you to be content with His provision. Like Asaph, God also wants you to share your testimony to encourage others.</p>
<p><strong>1. <u>Purify Your Heart: When You Feel Envy or Doubt, Ask God to Help You to Purify Your Heart of Worldly Desires</u>. Ps. 73:1-3.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph almost stumbled in his walk after seeing the prosperity of the wicked</u>. With humility, Asaph credited God with rescuing him from his own envy of wicked people: “<em>The End of the Wicked Contrasted with That of the Righteous. A Psalm of Asaph. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> God certainly is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart! <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For I was envious of the arrogant as I saw the prosperity of the wicked</em>.” (Ps. 73:1-3). Because of His grace, Asaph boasted “<em>God certainly is good to Israel”</em> (Ps. 73:1). “<mark>The psalmist was strongly tempted to envy the prosperity of the wicked; a common temptation, which has tried the graces of many saints. But he lays down the great principle by which he resolved to abide. It is the goodness of God. This is a truth which cannot be shaken. Good thoughts of God will fortify against Satan’s temptations.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 73).</mark><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God blesses the pure in heart</u>. Despite admitting to being a sinner, Asaph boldly proclaimed: “<em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> God certainly is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart!</em>” (Ps. 73:1). David made a similar claim: “<mark>Who may ascend onto the hill of the LORD? And who may stand in His holy place? One who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to deceit and has not sworn deceitfully.</mark>” (Ps. 24:3-4). Thus, David asked God to create a clean heart in him: “<mark>Create in me a clean heart, God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.</mark>” (Ps. 51:10). Jesus also called the pure in heart blessed and able to see God: “<mark>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.” (Matt. 5:8). Thankfully, Asaph reassures us that you don’t need to be without sin to be pure in heart.</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>Out of grace, God can rescue you from your sins</u>. Asaph admitted that his envy for the success of the wicked almost caused him to stumble in his walk: “</mark><em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped.</em>” (Ps. 73:2). <mark>When you persevere in your faith and seek after Him, God makes the same promise to you: “If I should say, ‘My foot has slipped,’ Your faithfulness, LORD, will support me.” (Ps. 94:18).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>Pray for God to purify and guard your heart</u>. Asaph admitted that: “</mark><em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>For I was envious of the arrogant as I saw the prosperity of the wicked</em>.” (Ps. 73:3). David warned believers not to envy the wicked: <mark>“A Psalm of David. Do not get upset because of evildoers, do not be envious of wrongdoers.” (Ps. 37:1). Solomon also warned believers to fear God and guard your heart from envying sinners: “Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of the LORD always.” (Prov. 23:17). “How blessed is the person who fears always, but one who hardens his heart will fall into disaster.” (Prov. 28:14). From Asaph, God reveals that you don’t need to feel condemned just because you feel envy. Instead self-loathing, turn to God in prayer to purify and guard your heart.</mark></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <u>Patience: When Things Feel Unfair, Be Patient for God’s Timing</u>. Ps. 73:4-9.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph marveled at the prosperity of the wicked who mocked God</u>. Asaph wondered why it seemed to be that the wicked appeared to be blessed with greater abundance than the righteous, even while they mocked God: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>For there are no pains in their death, and their belly is fat. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>They are not in trouble like other people, nor are they tormented together with the rest of mankind. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Therefore arrogance is their necklace; the garment of violence covers them. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Their eye bulges from fatness; the imaginations of their heart overflow. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; they speak from on high. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue parades through the earth</em>.” (Ps. 73:4-9). Watching the wicked prosper while the righteous suffer can cause many to question God’s fairness and whether He is active in our affairs: “While many saints are poor and afflicted, the prosperous sinner is neither. He is worse than other men, and yet he is better off; he ploughs least, and yet has the most fodder. He deserves the hottest hell, and yet has the warmest nest.” (Charles Spurgeon on Psalm 73).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>Job also marveled that the wicked appeared to better off than God-fearing people</u>. During his intense suffering, Job also questioned why God allowed the wicked to prosper: “The earth is handed over to the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?” (Job 9:24). “The tents of the destroyers prosper, and those who provoke God are secure, whom God brings into their power.” (Job 12:6). “Why do the wicked still live, grow old, and also become very powerful? . . . Their houses are safe from fear, and the rod of God is not on them.” (Job 21:7, 9).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be patient for God’s perfect timing</u>. Asaph questioned how the wicked could mock God with no immediate consequences: <mark>“</mark><em><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue parades through the earth</em>.” (Ps. 73:9). David also observed that many wicked people acted with open arrogance against God: <mark>“Who have said, ‘With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?”’ (Ps. 12:4). Some sadly use God’s mercy and grace as a license to sin. When things feel unfair to you, God wants you to be patient for His timing (Jam 5:8). He is just and fair (Dt. 32:4).</mark></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. <u>Trust: When Things Feel Unfair, Place Your Trust in God</u>. Ps. 73:10-14.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph questioned why he suffered more than the wicked</u>. During his suffering, Asaph lamented how many sinners dismissed the thought that God paid attention to their sins: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Therefore his people return here, and abundant waters are drunk by them. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They say, “How does God know? And is there knowledge with the Most High?” <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Behold, these are the wicked; and always at ease, they have increased in wealth. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>for I have been stricken all day long, and punished every morning</em>.” (Ps. 73:10-14). The prosperity of those who mocked God caused Asaph to doubt the utility of seeking to be pure in heart for God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wicked falsely believe that God is not watching their actions</u>. Asaph marveled how the wicked believed that God would not see their actions: “<em><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They say, “How does God know? And is there knowledge with the Most High?”</em> (Ps. 73:11). David also lamented the foolishness of those who believed that they could sin with impunity: “<mark>The wicked, in his haughtiness, does not seek Him. There is no God in all his schemes . . . He says to himself, ‘God has forgotten; He has hidden His face; He will never see it’ . . . Why has the wicked treated God disrespectfully? He has said to himself, ‘You will not require an account.”’ (Ps. 10:4, 11, 13). “For it flatters him in his own eyes Concerning the discovery of his wrongful deed and the hatred of it.</mark>” (Ps. 36:2). “<mark>Behold, they gush forth with their mouths; swords are in their lips, for, they say, ‘Who hears?”’ (Ps. 59:7).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>The wicked sometimes enjoy temporary wealth and power</u>. Asaph marveled that the wicked appeared to have an easier and more financially secured life than him: “</mark><em><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Behold, these are the wicked; and always at ease, they have increased in wealth.</em>” (Ps. 73:12). During his trials, Job also struggled with the same observation: “<mark>The tents of the destroyers prosper, and those who provoke God are secure, whom God brings into their power.</mark>” (Job 12:6). “<mark>Why do the wicked still live, grow old, and also become very powerful?</mark>” (Job 21:7). Jeremiah also struggled with how many wicked persons appeared to prosper without immediate consequences: “<mark>Righteous are You, LORD, when I plead my case with You; nevertheless I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?” (Jer. 12:1). Some could just as easily raise the same complaint about evil people today.</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>Don’t question God simply because evil people sometimes prosper</u>.</mark> Asaph <mark>questioned the value of trying to stay pure for God when the evil prospered around him: “</mark><em><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>for I have been stricken all day long, and punished every morning</em>.” (Ps. 73:13-14). Job also questioned the value of serving God when evil people seemed to prosper: “<mark>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we plead with Him?’” (Job 21:15).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God, and you will understand that He is in control</u>. Asaph never had his questions answered. But he still gained a heavenly perspective by seeking God. Job also never learned the reasons for his trials. But his objections melted away when he was in God’s presence. When you trust that God is in control, you also gain a heavenly understanding. Even the evil events in your life are working together for an ultimate good for God: “<mark>And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>The mysteries of God’s plans are frequently beyond our comprehension</u>. Despite being blessed with greater wisdom than any other, Solomon conceded that it was mystery why God allowed some wicked people to prosper while the righteous suffer: “<mark>I have seen everything during my lifetime of futility; there is a righteous person who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked person who prolongs his life in his wickedness.</mark>” (Ecc. 7:15). “<mark>There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On the other hand, there are evil people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this too is futility.” (Ecc. 8:14).</mark></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <u>Worship: When Things Feel Unfair, Find Comfort in Worship</u>. Ps. 73:15-17.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph found comfort from his dilemma in God’s sanctuary</u>. Even though God did not offer Asaph answers to his many questions, he gained understanding through worship: “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>If I had said, ‘I will speak this way,’ Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>When I thought of understanding this, it was troublesome in my sight <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>until I entered the sanctuary of God; then I perceived their end</em>.” (Ps. 73:15-17). When David faced trials, he knew that the answer was to seek out God’s comforting presence. At that time, it was in the temple: “<mark>One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD And to meditate in His temple.” (Ps. 27:4).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship God whenever you are in doubt or in need of comfort</u>. One commentator observes: “What did going to the house of God do for Asaph? There, he could gain understanding in several ways. · By prayer and worship in the sanctuary, he understood that God was at the center of all things, and he gained a fresh appreciation of both God and eternity. · By hearing the word of God in the sanctuary, he understood that there was a truth that went beyond what he saw and experienced in everyday life. · By observing sacrifice at the sanctuary, he understood that God takes sin so seriously that it must be judged and atoned for, even if it is by an innocent victim who stands in the place of the guilty by faith. This is one of God’s great purposes in establishing a place where His people come to meet with Him. It is never to imply that there is only one or only a few places where man can meet with God, or that they must be ornate or glorious buildings. It is to emphasize that it is good to have a place separate from other places where we focus on a heavenly, eternal perspective.” (David Guzik on Psalm 73).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> When you worship, you take your eyes off your own problems and give your burdens to Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. <u>Repent: When You Envy Worldly Things, Confess Your Sins</u>. Ps. 73:18-22.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph confessed that he envied the illusion of the success of the wicked</u>. Asaph at first thought that his envy would cause his walk to slip (Ps. 73:2). But with his heavenly perspective, he realized that the wicked were the ones who were on a slippery slope to eternal ruin. Thus, he confessed his foolishness to God: “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>You indeed put them on slippery ground; You dropped them into ruin. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>How they are destroyed in a moment! They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors! <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Like a dream when one awakes, Lord, when stirred, You will despise their image</em>. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>When my heart was embittered and I was pierced within, <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>then I was stupid and ignorant; I was like an animal before You.</em>” (Ps. 73:18-22). What the devil offers is a mirage. He promises joy but can only provide eternal despair. Thus, if you envy worldly success, repent of your misguided desires.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t envy the wicked because they will face judgment</u>. You should never envy wicked people because everything they have will one day vanish. “<mark>There they are in great dread, for God is with a righteous generation.</mark>” (Ps. 14:5). “<mark>But wrongdoers will altogether be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be eliminated.</mark>” (Ps. 37:38). “<mark>When the wicked sprouted up like grass and all who did injustice flourished, it was only that they might be destroyed forevermore.</mark>” (Ps. 92:7). “<mark>Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</mark>” (John 12:31). “Let them flaunt their little hour, poor unsubstantial sons of dreams; they will soon be gone; when the day breaketh, and the Lord awakes as a mighty man out of his sleep, they will vanish away. Who cares for the wealth of dreamland? Who indeed but fools?” (Charles Spurgeon on Psalm 73).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is foolishness to the world</u>. The wisdom of the world can be tempting. But it is based upon a foolish love of darkness: “<mark>And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil.</mark>” (John 3:19). “<mark>Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made foolish the wisdom of the world?</mark>” (1 Cor. 1:20). “<mark>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: ‘He is the One who catches the wise by their craftiness;”’ (1 Cor. 3:19). “in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Cor. 4:4).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>God exposes our sinful thinking so that we may confess and repent of our sins</u>. Asaph confessed his foolishness before God: “<em>I was stupid and ignorant; I was like an animal before You.</em>” (Ps. 73:22). God also tests His people to expose their foolishness: “<mark>I said to myself regarding the sons of mankind, ‘God is testing them in order for them to see that they are as animals, they to themselves.”’ (Ecc. 3:18). “Mankind in its splendor, yet without understanding, is like the animals that perish.” (Ps. 49:20). If you envy the worldly successes of other people, repent of your worldly thinking. God can then transform your mind and purify your worldly desires: “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Ro. 12:2).</mark></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <u>Gratitude: When Things Feel Unfair, Be Grateful to God</u>. Ps. 73:23-24.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph was grateful for God’s grace in providing him support and guidance</u>. Asaph was astonished that God would support and guide him despite his sinful and doubting nature: “<em><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>You will guide me with Your plan, and afterward receive me to glory</em>.” (Ps. 73:23-24). God also offers the same mercy and grace when you turn to Him. He longs to support and guide you. “<mark>Come close to God and He will come close to you.” (Jam. 4:8a).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s support and guidance</u>. Asaph gave thanks that God supported and guided him: “<em>I am continually with You; You have taken hold of my right hand. You will guide me with Your plan, . .</em> .” (Ps. 73:23-24). God guides those who turn to Him:<br />
“<mark>I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will advise you with My eye upon you.” (Ps. 32:8). “This is what the LORD says, He who is your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: ‘I am the LORD your God, who teaches you to benefit, who leads you in the way you should go.”’ (Is. 48:17). For this reason,</mark> David gave thanks: “<mark>I will bless the LORD who has advised me; indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.” (Ps. 16:7). “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105).</mark></p></li>
<li><p><u>Make gratitude a regular part of your walk with God</u>. The psalms are filled with examples of prayers and songs of appreciation for you to follow: “<mark>Let’s come before His presence with a song of thanksgiving, let’s shout joyfully to Him in songs with instruments.</mark>” (Ps. 95:2). “<mark>Enter His gates with thanksgiving, and His courtyards with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name.</mark>” (Ps. 100:4). “<mark>Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praises to our God on the lyre;</mark>” (Ps. 147:7). “<mark>But I will sacrifice to You with a voice of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD.” (John. 2:9). Even when you are going through a trial, you can find reasons to be grateful. Are you giving thanks on a regular basis for all that God does for you?</mark></p></li>

<p>Turn to God when you need correction, guidance, and the strength to stay with Him<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>7. <u>Contentment: Be Content with God’s Provision in Your Life</u>. Ps. 73:25-28.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asaph found contentment in God’s presence and eternal fellowship</u>. Asaph realized that he had no reason to covet the evil things of the flesh that quickly vanish. He would instead find contentment and strength in God’s refuge and in His comforting presence: “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>Whom do I have in heaven but You? And with You, I desire nothing on earth. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>For, behold, those who are far from You will perish; You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>But as for me, the nearness of God is good for me; I have made the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> my refuge, so that I may tell of all Your works</em>.” (Ps. 73:25-28). God also offers to strengthen you when you are content with His provision and presence.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be content as God provides for you</u>. Even though he lacked the things of the wicked and suffered, Asaph needed nothing more than his relationship with God: “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>Whom do I have in heaven but You? And with You, I desire nothing on earth.</em>” (Ps. 73:25). David also realized that his relationship with God was the most important thing in life: “<mark>I said to the LORD, ‘You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides You.”’ (Ps. 16:2).</mark> Paul later realized that every worldly accomplishment was mere rubbish in comparison to his relationship with God: “<mark>More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them mere rubbish, so that I may gain Christ,” (Phil. 3:8). “But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment.” (1 Tim. 6:6). Are you content with God’s provision in your life?</mark></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-73/media/image1.jpg" style="width:5.99027in;height:3.92744in" alt="Psalm 73:26 God Is The Strength Of My Heart (black)" /></p>
<p>Let God strengthen you when you are weak<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your hope in God, and you will never be disappointed</u>. Even when he felt defeated, Asaph placed his hope in God and found strength through his faith: “<em><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever</em>.” (Ps. 73:26). God promises to strengthen you when you place your hope in Him: “<mark>Wait for the LORD; be strong and let your heart take courage; yes, wait for the LORD.</mark>” (Ps. 27:14). “<mark>Be strong and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the LORD.</mark>” (Ps. 31:24). “<mark>My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for Your word.” (Ps. 119:81). “I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and I wait for His word.” (Ps. 130:5). God also wants you to wait patiently for Him and place your hope in Him. He will then strengthen you.</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>Share your testimony regarding God’s blessings in your life</u>.</mark> Asaph promised to share his praise for God to encourage others: <mark>“</mark><em>I have made the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> my refuge, so that I may tell of all Your works</em>.” (Ps. 73:28). David also shared his testimony to encourage others: “<mark>Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; declare His deeds among the peoples.” (Ps. 9:11). “Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make His deeds known among the peoples.” (Ps. 105:1). “They shall also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of His works with joyful singing.” (Ps. 107:22). God also wants you to share your testimony regarding God’s blessings in your life to encourage others. Are you sharing your testimony and the hope Jesus offers (Matt. 28:16-20)?</mark></p></li>
