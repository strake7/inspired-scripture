<h1 id="psalm-134-lessons-for-a-worship-life-that-is-honoring-to-god"><strong>Psalm 134: Lessons For a Worship Life that is Honoring to God</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the fifteenth and final Song of Ascents (Ps. 120–134). After Psalm 117, Psalms 131, 133 and 134 are all tied as the second shortest psalms, each with only three verses. But Psalm 134 is the second shortest psalm and Bible chapter in terms of total word count. “<em>A Song of Ascents.<strong> <sup>1</sup></strong> Behold, bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, all you servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who serve by night in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Lift up your hands to the sanctuary and bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth</em>.” (Ps. 134:1-3).</p>
<p>The pilgrims returning to Jerusalem following the exile sang this Psalm after they assembled together to worship God. According to one Bible scholar’s interpretation, “This Psalm consists of a call (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1-2</a>) and a response (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/134-3.htm">Psalm 134:3</a>). The call appears to be addressed by the worshippers in the Temple to the priests and Levites whose duty it was to render the nightly service of praise to Jehovah, and their leader responds to it with a priestly blessing. The Psalm forms a fit conclusion to the collection of Pilgrim-Songs. It may have been composed after the restoration of the Temple-services by Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-47</a>).” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 134).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Charles Spurgeon further theorizes, “The Pilgrims are going home, and are singing the last song in their psalter. They leave early in the morning, before the day has fully commenced, for the journey is long for many of them. While yet the night lingers they are on the move. As soon as they are outside the gates they see the guards upon the temple wall, and the lamps shining from the windows of the chambers which surround the sanctuary; therefore, moved by the sight, they chant a farewell to the perpetual attendants upon the holy shrine. Their parting exhortation arouses the priests to pronounce upon them a blessing out of the holy place: this benediction is contained in the third verse.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 134).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This Psalm reveals seven lessons on worship that honors God. Your worship should include: (1) adoration, (2) devotion, (3) holiness, (4) continuity, (5) vigilance, (6) prayer, and (7) faith.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the pilgrims encouraged Levite priests to bless God. This was an encouragement for them to make sure that their actions glorified God through a heart of loving adoration. Your worship also blesses God when it is done through loving adoration. <u>Second</u>, the pilgrims gave this encouragement to priests who already showed hearts of devotion by serving God as His night watchmen. You also honor God through your devotion. <u>Third</u>, the pilgrims encouraged the priests to remain holy in their worship. Your worship also honors God when you remain holy. <u>Fourth</u>, the pilgrims repeated their urging for the priests to bless God. The message is that worship honors God when it is ongoing. <u>Fifth</u>, the night watchmen were to remain vigilant for God’s message or enemy attacks. Your worship life should also be vigilant. <u>Sixth</u>, the priests responded to the pilgrims with a prayer for God to bless them. Your worship should also include prayers of blessings for others. <u>Finally</u>, the priests declared that it was the Creator who would bless the pilgrims. True worship also rests on faith in God’s holy, sovereign power. Nothing is impossible with God. But He desires that you pray with faith in His ability to answer any prayer.</p>
<h2 id="adoration-worship-with-loving-adoration-blesses-god.-ps.-1341a."><strong>1. <u>Adoration: Worship With Loving Adoration Blesses God</u>. Ps. 134:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Worship blesses God when it honors Him</u>. The Levite priests had committed their lives to serving God. But the departing pilgrims encouraged the priests to bless God through loving adoration. “<em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Behold, bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, all you servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord,</span>…</em>” (Ps. 134:1a). The Hebrew word “<span dir="rtl">כ֣ו</span>ּ”(ba·ra·chu) means “to kneel” or to “bless”.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Here, the intended meaning was more than a mere physical act of kneeling before God. “The word ‘bless’ expresses the idea of ‘praise’ here; but it might refer to a specific form of praise to be offered (such as recorded in Deut. 26:1-15). It is praise designed to enhance or enrich God’s reputation in the minds of the people.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 134:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Serving God without a love for Him has little value</u>. The pilgrims might have seemed presumptuous telling the priests to bless God when they had already devoted themselves to a life of service. But this was a reminder that worship that is not motivated by a love for God has little value to Him. “Their departing brethren arouse them with the shrill cry of ‘Behold!’ Behold!—see, take care, be on the watch, diligently mind your work, and incessantly adore and bless Jehovah's name. Bless ye the LORD. Think well of Jehovah, and speak well of him. Adore him with reverence, draw near to him with love, delight in him with exultation. Be not content with praise, such as all his works render to him; but, as his saints, see that ye ‘bless’ him. He blesses you; therefore, be zealous to bless him.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 134:1).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This lesson applies to all believers.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Bless and praise God’s holy name</u>. Others psalms reflected the desire of the psalmists to honor God through their loving adoration. David declared a similar blessing for God’s holy name: “<em><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, . . . bless His holy name</em>. <em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>” (Ps. 103:1-2). Other psalmists also urged believers to “<em>bless His name</em>.” (Ps. 100:4c). “House of Israel, bless the LORD; house of Aaron, <em>bless the LORD</em>;” (Ps. 135:19). In reference to God’s character, the psalmists repeatedly blessed God’s holy “name”: “For our heart rejoices in Him, because we <em>trust in His holy name</em>.” (Ps. 33:21). “<em>Bless the LORD</em>, my soul! LORD my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty,” (Ps. 104:1). “<em>Boast in His holy name</em>; may the heart of those who seek the LORD be joyful.” (Ps. 105:3). “<em>Blessed be the name of the LORD</em> from this time on and forever.” (Ps. 113:2). “<em>Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD</em>, my soul!” (Ps. 146:1). Moses also proclaimed God’s holy name: “For <em>I proclaim the name of the LORD</em>; ascribe greatness to our God!” (Dt. 32:3). God deserves your complete praise for His holy character.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith, you become part of Jesus’ servant priests</u>. The message to the “<em>servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord,</span>…</em>” (Ps. 134:1) applies to any believer in Jesus. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He can also make you one of His priests. “But you are a chosen people, <em>a royal priesthood</em>, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Pet. 2:9). “and He made us into a kingdom, <em>priests to His God and Father</em>—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.” (Rev. 1:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Repay the honor of serving God by blessing Him</u>. “The <strong>servants</strong> of God have special reason to bless and praise Him. If the <strong>servants of the LORD</strong> do not praise Him, who will? · They partner with God in His work, which is a special privilege. · They enjoy the nearness that comes with working together with God. · They receive special strength and anointing as they serve Him. · They have new and exciting challenges of faith. Since this is addressed to <strong>servants of the LORD</strong>, this psalm shows us that <em>praise</em> should be added to all our work.” (David Guzik on Ps. 134:1) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus with your mind, your heart, and your soul<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Bless God’s holy name because He is loving, good, and faithful</u>. You have many reasons to bless God by honoring Him. For example, David praised God for His “goodness” and “faithfulness” “<em>Certainly goodness and faithfulness</em> will follow me all the days of my life, <sup> </sup>and my dwelling will be in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> forever.”  (Ps. 23:6). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Bless God’s holy name because He is merciful</u>. Even though every person deserves to die for their sins, you can give thanks that God is filled with mercy each time you repent and return to Him: “<em>The Lord’s acts of mercy indeed do not end, for His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.</em>” (Lam. 3:22-23). “Then you will say on that day, “I will give thanks to You, LORD; for although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.” (Is. 12:1). “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you.” (Is. 54:7). He is merciful in the face of our sins because he is filled with compassion and love: “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="devotion-worship-should-be-an-expression-of-your-devotion.-ps.-1341b."><strong>2. <u>Devotion: Worship Should Be An Expression of Your Devotion</u>. Ps. 134:1b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A lifetime of devotion to God honors Him</u>. The pilgrims gave their message to priests who quietly served with little public praise. They faithfully served God when most people were still sleeping. “… <em>who serve by night in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 134:1b). Your sacrifice for God also honors Him by expressing your devotion to Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-134/media/image2.jpg" style="width:5.94679in;height:2.15355in" alt="PSALM 134-Praise in the Night" /></p>
<p>Devote yourself to God by praising Him at all times, even when others are not watching<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God called the Levities to devote themselves to a lifetime of service</u>. The Levites devoted themselves with a lifetime of sacrifice. They served God both during the day and at night, even when no one was watching. “Now these are the singers, heads of fathers’ households of <em>the Levites</em>, who lived in the chambers of the temple free of other duties; <em>for they were engaged in their work day and night</em>.” (1 Chr. 9:33). When the Jews returned from exile, the Levites reaffirmed their vows to faithfully serve God. “Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of King David of Israel. And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, ‘For He is good, for His favor is upon Israel forever.’ And all the people shouted with a great shout of joy when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.” (Ezra 3:10-11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To find your life, you must be willing to lose it</u>. Serving God at night would have brought little honor for these priests.  But God’s greatest servants all gave up their worldly honors for the privilege of serving Him. For example, Moses gave up his life of privilege in Pharaoh’s house to serve the Jews.  Paul also gave up his privilege and influence to serve Jesus.  Jesus also put aside His grandeur to die a humble servant to save mankind:  “who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.”  (Phil. 2:6-7).  You must also be willing to lose your worldly life to find Jesus:  “Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.”  (Matt. 10:39; 16:25).  “‘If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.’”  (Lk. 9:23; Mk. 8:34).  Paul later realized that his prior accomplishments were nothing compared to the value of his relationship with Christ:   “But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.”  (Phil. 3:7; same, Heb. 13:13).  Do you value the things of God more than your wealth and worldly accomplishments?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Always be ready to help sinners find Jesus</u>. Among other duties, the priests ensured that the altar fire for atonement sacrifices continually burned. “Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it is not to go out.” (Lev. 6:13). They kept the fire burning at all times to allow for sinners to atone for their sins at any moment. “Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;” (Heb. 10:11). As a priest for Jesus, you are also called upon to be ready to help guide sinners to Him and encourage them. “Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.” (1 Thess. 5:11). You are also called upon to always be ready to explain your hope in Jesus. “but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, but with gentleness and respect;” (1 Pet. 3:15). If God sends a person who is depressed or in spiritual need, are you ready to respond?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship should happen at all times</u>. In some psalms, the psalmist would worship in the morning: “But as for me, I will sing of Your strength; yes, I will joyfully sing of Your faithfulness in the morning, for You have been my refuge and a place of refuge on the day of my distress.” (Ps. 59:16). Other psalms declared that the psalmists would worship at night: “LORD, I remember Your name in the night, and keep Your Law.” (Ps. 119:55). In other psalms, the psalmists declared that they would worship God both day and night. “To declare Your goodness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night,” (Ps. 92:2). Even when he was in jail, Paul sang and worshiped throughout the night. “Now about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;” (Acts 16:25). In heaven, the angels worship Jesus at all times. “For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.” (Rev. 7:15). Your devotion is best expressed through ongoing worship. Your ongoing worship should also help other believers to turn to God and worship Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a living sacrifice for Jesus</u>. Like the faithful Levities, you are also called upon to be a living sacrifice for Jesus. “Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). This includes a life that offers continual sacrifices of praise out of devotion, not obligation. “Through Him then, let’s continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name.” (Heb. 13:15). Do others see in you an example of ongoing devotion and sacrifice for Jesus?</p></li>

<h2 id="holiness-your-worship-honors-god-when-you-remain-holy.-ps.-1342a."><strong>3. <u>Holiness: Your Worship Honors God When You Remain Holy</u>. Ps. 134:2a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Holy worship honors God</u>. The pilgrims also encouraged the priests to worship in a holy manner, through hands lifted up to God in reverent worship in the Temple sanctuary. “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Lift up your hands to the sanctuary…</em>” (Ps. 134:2a). The Jewish “the Targum renders it, in a holy manner; and is the same with lifting up holy hands,” (John Gill on Ps. 134).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> If you lift up your hands as a physical act of worship but without a holy devotion, it has little meaning. “Lift up your hands unto God in prayer and praises, thus expressing and exciting your inward devotion … Do not content yourselves with lifting up your hands, but see that this be done with pure and holy hearts.” (Matthew Poole on Ps. 134:2).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-134/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.00474in;height:2.49186in" alt="Psalm 134 Lift up your hands ( Listen to, Dramatized or Read) - GNT - Uplifting Scriptures" /></p>
<p>Let your lifted hands remind you to approach God with a holy heart<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The raising of hands has always been part of Bible worship</u>. It is your heart that matters most to God. Throughout the Bible, there are examples in both the Old and New Testaments where worshippers, including David, raised their hands as they worshipped God. But it was always done as a sign of holy inward devotion to Him. “Hear the sound of my pleadings when I cry to You for help, when <em>I raise my hands toward Your holy sanctuary</em>.” (Ps. 28:2). “May my prayer be counted as incense before You; <em>the raising of my hands as the evening offering</em>.” (Ps. 141:2). “Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, <em>lifting up holy hands</em>, without anger and dispute.” (1 Tim. 2:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy because God is holy</u>.  The Levites were meant to serve and be a holy example. Serving those in need and being “unstained by the world” are the two parts of “true religion.”  (Jam. 1:27).  “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”  (Matt. 5:8).  Jesus wants the Church to be holy because He is holy:  “you shall be holy, for I am holy.”  (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-5; 19:2; 20:7).  The pathway to heaven is also only available to those who are made pure through faith in Him: “A highway will be there, a roadway, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness.  The unclean will not travel on it, . . .”  (Is. 35:8).  Thus, God wants you to honor Him by living a life that is holy.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="continuity-your-worship-honors-god-when-it-is-ongoing.-ps.-1342b."><strong>4. <u>Continuity: Your Worship Honors God When It is Ongoing</u>. Ps. 134:2b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Worship that blesses God is ongoing</u>. To encourage the priests to regularly honor God, the pilgrims repeated their encouragement that they bless God with their worship. “…<em>and bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</em>” (Ps. 134:2b). The Hebrew word to bless in verse 2 “<span dir="rtl">ו</span>ּ”(u·va·ra·chu) is different than the Hebrew word to bless in verse 1 “<span dir="rtl">כ֣ו</span>ּ”(ba·ra·chu). But this is also translated into English as either “to kneel” or to “bless”.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-134/media/image4.jpg" style="width:6.5in;height:3.49908in" /></p>
<p>Bless God with praise that is ongoing<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to God on a regular basis</u>. The psalms remind believers to make praise and worship a regular part of your walk with God, not just when you attend church: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, <em>sing for joy forever</em>! And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.” (Ps. 7:17). “I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Be exalted, LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.” (Ps. “For the music director. A Song. A Psalm. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth; sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:1-2). “Sing to God, sing praises to His name; exalt Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the LORD, and be jubilant before Him.” (Ps. 68:4). “For the music director; on the Gittith  A Psalm of Asaph. Sing for joy to God our strength; shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.” (Ps. 81:1). “Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth; be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.” (Ps. 98:4). “Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.” (Ps. 135:3). Are you regularly praising God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Honor God by guarding your heart and asking Him to cleanse it of sinful desires</u>. The pilgrims’ repeated the command for the priests to “<em>bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Ps. 134:2) was also done for emphasis. The priests had to guard their hearts on an ongoing basis because every heart is evil and quickly goes astray. “Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.” (Prov. 4:23). “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). You can also bless God by regularly asking Him to clean your heart of sinful desires. “Create in me a clean heart, cod, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” (Ps. 51:10). “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Ro. 12:2).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vigilance-worship-honors-god-when-you-remain-vigilant.-ps.-1341-2."><strong>5. <u>Vigilance: Worship Honors God When You Remain Vigilant</u>. Ps. 134:1-2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be vigilant to receive God’s Word and to be wary of enemy attacks</u>. The pilgrims spoke to the watchmen, “<em>who serve by night in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 134:1b). They were night watchmen who stood on the rebuilt walls to protect Jerusalem from physical attack. These night watchmen served in the Temple to be on the lookout for God’s prophetic messages to the people. They also stood as guards against spiritual attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The watchmen were God’s pointed servants to watch over His people</u>. Through the prophets, God revealed that He appointed the watchmen and commanded them to be vigilant at all times: “<em>On your walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; all day and all night they will never keep silent. You who profess the LORD, take no rest for yourselves</em>;” (Is. 62:6). Prior to the exile, God condemned the watchmen who failed to listen to His prophetic warnings for the people. “<em>And I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!</em>’ But they said, ‘We will not listen.’” (Jer. 6:17). “His watchmen are blind, All of them know nothing. All of them are mute dogs unable to bark, dreamers lying down, who love to slumber;” (Is. 56:10). With Jerusalem rebuilt, the implicit message was that these watchmen should not make the same mistake and squander God’s mercy and grace and His revelations to protect and guide His people.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be a watchperson to protect and speak blessings over God’s people</u>. God calls upon church leaders to perform a similar spiritual role in guarding God’s flock from the enemy’s attacks and to encourage the people to serve Him. “Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.” (Acts 20:28). “shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not with greed but with eagerness;” (1 Pet.5:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will bless those who remain vigilant in watching for His return</u>. God promised a blessing for those who remain vigilant. “Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, and therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; <em>how blessed are all those who long for Him</em>.” (Is. 30:18). “The LORD is good to those who await Him, to the person <em>who</em> seeks Him. <em>It is good that he waits silently for the salvation of the LORD</em>.” (Lam. 3:25-26). In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, Jesus illustrated the importance of being ready for His return at any moment (Matt. 25:1-13). “But about that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.” (Matt. 24:36). “For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night.” (1 Thess. 5:2).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prayer-worship-honors-god-when-you-pray-to-bless-others.-ps.-1343a."><strong>6. <u>Prayer: Worship Honors God When You Pray to Bless Others</u>. Ps. 134:3a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Honor God by praying His blessings over others</u>. The Temple priests responded to the pilgrims by praying for God to pour out His blessings for their encouragement. “<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> bless you from Zion,</em>…” (Ps. 134:3a). The Hebrew word to bless in verse 3, “<span dir="rtl">ך</span>ָ֣”(ye·va·rech·cha), is different than the word in verse 2 “<span dir="rtl">ו</span>ּ”(u·va·ra·chu) and verse 1 “<span dir="rtl">כ֣ו</span>ּ”(ba·ra·chu). But it is also translated into English as “bless.”<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> How does our blessing God differ from Him blessing us? “When we bless God, we kneel or bow down before him in worship. When God blesses us, he reaches down to take care of us and our needs. We bless God by praising him for who he is and what he has done, and God blesses us by loving us and providing for us.” (Ray Fowler on Ps. 134).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The priests’ service included praying prayers of blessings</u>. The priests repeated part of the Aaronic blessing. “The LORD bless you, and keep you;” (Nu. 6:24). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11). “In the last verse those who were thus called upon to praise God pray for him that gave them the exhortation, either the high priest or the captain of the guard. Or thus: those who did that service did mutually exhort one another and pray for one another. In singing this psalm we must both stir up ourselves to give glory to God and encourage ourselves to hope for mercy and grace from him.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 134:3).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God seeks shepherds who love His sheep</u>.  The priests showed their love for God’s people through their prayers. Before the exile, Jeremiah promised that God would send shepherds for His sheep:  “Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding.”  (Jer. 3:15).  Ezra and Nehemiah were among God’s promised shepherds.  They inspired the Levites to be loving shepherds for God’s lost sheep. Jesus was the ultimate fulfillment of this promise.  “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.”  (Jo. 10:11).  Jesus, however, fulfills this promise today through His leaders.  Thus, He told Peter to show his love for Him by being a shepherd to His sheep:  “He [Jesus] said to him the third time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love Me?’  Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, ‘<em>Do you love Me</em>?’  And he said to Him, ‘Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.’  Jesus said to him, ‘<em>Tend My sheep</em>.”’  (John 21:17).  “ . . . <em>shepherd the flock of</em> God among you, . . .”  (1 Pet. 5:2).  “Know well the condition of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds;”  (Prov. 27:23).  Are you a shepherd to Jesus’ lost sheep?  Do you pray for those around you trapped in sin, illness, or despair?</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-worship-honors-god-when-you-pray-with-faith-in-god.-ps.-1343b."><strong>7. <u>Faith: Worship Honors God When You Pray With Faith in God</u>. Ps. 134:3b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Worship must be rooted in faith about who God is</u>. As a sign of their humility, the priests made clear that it was the Creator alone who would bless them. “… <em>He who made heaven and earth</em>.” (Ps. 134:3b). “Whoever voiced the blessing, it was worded in a way to remind people that it is God who blesses, not the speakers.” (Ross on Ps. 134:3).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign and faithful to keep His promises</u>. Other psalmists also celebrated that God the Creator would deliver him and the Jews from oppression. “My help comes from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 121:2). “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 124:8). God created the universe (Gen. 1:1; Dt. 10:14; Acts 4:24; Col. 1:16). He later selected Abram, despite being an idol worshipper from Ur (Gen. 11:31; 12:1; Josh. 24:2). He then renamed him Abraham (Gen. 17:5). And He made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to give them the Promised Land (Gen. 12:6-7; 13:14-15; 15:18; 17:8; 26:4; 28:13-15; 50:24; Ex. 12:25; 23:20-31; 33:1-3; Dt. 1:19-20). Do you trust that God is sovereign and faithful?</p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, all things are possible</u>. God once told Abraham: “Is there anything too difficult for the Lord?” (Gen. 18:14). Jeremiah once called upon God as the Creator to celebrate that all things are possible with Him. “Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,” (Jer. 32:17). “And looking at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.’” (Matt. 19:26; Mk. 10:27). “For nothing will be impossible with God.” (Lk. 1:37). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). If you are in need or lacking, do you trust in faith that God can do anything?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The God who blessed the Jews from Zion foreshadows the Creator’s New Jerusalem</u>. The Creator will one day create a new heaven and Earth (Rev. 21:1). The Creator will prepare a New Jerusalem where Jesus will be united with His Church and rule forever in peace as the King of Kings. “And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (Rev. 21:2). “Psalm 134 assumes a situation where God is present in his holy place among his holy people. The exiles have been brought home. The covenant has been renewed, indeed, made new. God’s dwelling place has been completed, new Jerusalem as new Eden and new holy of holies, new heaven and earth as cosmic temple. God’s people have made a kingdom and priests, and they bless him, enjoying in turn his blessings.”<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
