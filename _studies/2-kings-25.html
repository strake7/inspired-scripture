Kings 25: Lessons From Judah’s Final Destruction on Rebellion Against
God’s Word.</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: In 586 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah for
the third time and sent a third wave of Jews into Babylonian captivity.
Those who remained in Judah later fled to Egypt after certain Jews
killed Nebuchadnezzar’s appointed governor. God had freed His people
from Egyptian bondage and gave them the Promised Land as their
inheritance. Yet, before the Jews took the Promised Land, Moses gave
God’s warning that their right to enjoy the Promised Land was
conditional upon their obedience: “But it shall come about, if you do
not obey the LORD your God, to observe to do all His commandments and
His statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses will
come upon you and overtake you:” (Dt. 28:15). This included a warning of
exile and great suffering (Dt. 28:64-65). The Jews, however, ignored
God’s warnings. Out of mercy and grace, God sent His prophets to repeat
these warnings. But the Jews rebelled against God and again ignored His
Word. After the Jews ignored all lesser forms of discipline, God
fulfilled His promise and sent the Jews into exile. This was one of the
darkest points in Jewish history. Sadly, all of their suffering could
have been avoided. From the Jews’ mistakes and their exile, God reveals
seven lessons on rebelling against Him and His Word. Rebellion against
God and His Word leads to: (1) suffering, (2) spiritual blindness, (3)
bondage, (4) spiritual poverty, (5) despair, (6) helplessness, and (7)
the need for God’s mercy and grace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Zedekiah rebelled against God’s Word and revolted
against the Babylonians. This led to Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion, the loss
of most of Judah, and mass starvation in Jerusalem. From Zedekiah’s
mistakes, God reveals that living in rebellion against Him and His Word
leads to suffering. <u>Second</u>, Nebuchadnezzar later captured
Zedekiah, killed his sons, and then blinded him. His physical blindness
was the outward manifestation of his spiritual blindness. From
Zedekiah’s mistakes, God reveals that rebellion against Him and His Word
leads to spiritual blindness. <u>Third</u>, the Jews’ rebellion led to
their captivity in Babylon. Their physical bondage was the outward
manifestation of their spiritual bondage. From the Jews’ mistakes, God
reveals that rebellion against Him and His Word leads to spiritual
bondage. <u>Fourth</u>, the Babylonians took all of the Jews wealth and
left behind only the poor. From the Jews’ mistakes, God reveals that
rebellion against Him and His Word leads to spiritual poverty.
<u>Fifth</u>, the Jews suffered in captivity and many of their leaders
were executed. Many lived in despair. From the Jews’ suffering, God
reveals that rebellion against His Word leads to despair. <u>Sixth</u>,
the Jews revolted and assassinated Nebuchadnezzar’s governor of Judah.
Because the Jews acted against God’s Word, they felt helpless against a
Babylonian retaliation. Thus, both the innocent and the guilty were
forced to flee to Egypt where they suffered even more. From the Jews’
mistakes, God reveals that rebellion against Him and His Word leads to
helplessness. <u>Finally</u>, even though the Jews did not deserve it,
God showed mercy and grace by releasing a captured Jewish king from jail
and treating him kindly. This was to show that God would honor His
covenants with the Jews. From God’s actions, He reveals that rebellion
against His Word leads to the need for His mercy and grace. Jesus Christ
provides the mercy and grace that everyone needs for their sins.</p>

<u>Suffering: Living in Rebellion Against God’s Word Leads to
Suffering</u>. 2 Kgs. 25:1-3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and caused a great
famine</u>. As God’s instrument of judgment, Nebuchadnezzar caused a
famine in Jerusalem after encircling it. Many died because of King
Zedekiah’s foolish revolt: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now in the ninth year of
his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it
and built a siege wall all around it. <sup>2 </sup>So the city was under
siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. <sup>3 </sup>On the
ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that
there was no food for the people of the land.</em> (2 Kgs. 25:1-3).
After Egyptian Pharaoh Apries took the throne, he encouraged Zedekiah to
lead a rebellion against the Babylonians. Yet, because God did not
sanction this rebellion, it failed (2 Kgs. 24:20). In 588 B.C., during
the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, he sent his army to punish the
Jews. They encircled the city and cut off the city’s supplies. Hezekiah
previously built a tunnel that allowed the city to continue to receive
water (2 Kgs. 20:20). Yet, without a supply of food for two and a half
years, the Babylonians brought about a famine within the city (Jer.
38:2-3). A third of the city died from this famine. The suffering also
weakened the will of the people to fight. During Jerusalem’s two-year
siege (2 Kgs. 24:2; Jer. 39:1), Nebuchadnezzar also taunted the Jews
within the city by taking control over all of Judah (Jer. 21:3-7;
34:7).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar was the instrument of God’s judgment</u>. In
case any Jews felt that God was remiss in failing to stop
Nebuchadnezzar, the prophet Jeremiah warned the people in advance that
God planned to send Nebuchadnezzar as His instrument of judgment:
‘“behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares
the LORD, ‘and <em>I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My
servant</em>, and will bring them against this land and against its
inhabitants and against all these nations round about; and I will
utterly destroy them and make them a horror and a hissing, and an
everlasting desolation.”’ (Jer. 25:9) “and say to them, ‘Thus says the
LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, <em>I am going to send and
get Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant</em>, and I am going
to set his throne right over these stones that I have hidden; and he
will spread his canopy over them.”’’ (Jer. 43:10). Yet, the Jews ignored
these warnings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The siege of Jerusalem fulfilled a prophecy</u>. To warn the
people and to give them an opportunity to repent, the prophet Jeremiah
also warned that the Babylonians would soon lay siege to Jerusalem:
“Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Behold, I am about to turn back the
weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are warring
against <em>the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you
outside the wall</em>; and I will gather them into the center of this
city.”’ (Jer. 21:4). Yet, the Jews ignored this warning.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The starvation of Jerusalem fulfilled a prophecy</u>. To also
warn the people and to give them an opportunity to repent, the prophet
Jeremiah warned that the people would suffer starvation: “<em>He who
dwells in this city will die by the sword and by famine</em> and by
pestilence; but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are
besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as booty.” (Jer.
21:9). “Thus says the LORD, ‘He who stays in this city will die by the
sword and by famine and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the
Chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive.’
(Jer. 38:2). The prophet Ezekiel also warned that a third of the people
would die through starvation, a third would die in combat, and a third
would be sent into exile: “<em>One third of you will die by plague or be
consumed by famine among you</em>, one third will fall by the sword
around you, and one third I will scatter to every wind, and I will
unsheathe a sword behind them.” (Ezek. 5:12). The Jews, however, ignored
these warnings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God judged the Jews because of their pride and refusal to
change their sinful ways</u>. Through Jeremiah, God repeatedly warned
the proud Jews that God judged them because they would not repent and
change their ways: “Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had
sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house and
said to all the people: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
‘Behold, I am about to bring on this city and all its towns the entire
calamity that I have declared against it, <em>because they have
stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.</em>’”
(Jer.19:14-15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The famine with parents eating their children fulfilled a
prophecy</u>. The famine was so horrific that some parents ate their
children. This also fulfilled many prophecies, including some dating
back to Moses: “Then you shall eat the offspring of your own body, the
flesh of your sons and of your daughters whom the LORD your God has
given you, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will
oppress you.” (Dt. 28:53). “Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons
and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.” (Lev. 26:29). Jeremiah
repeated this prophecy: “I will make them eat the flesh of their sons
and the flesh of their daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh
in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies and those who
seek their life will distress them.” (Jer. 19:9). Ezekiel also repeated
it: “Therefore, fathers will eat their sons among you, and sons will eat
their fathers; for I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your
remnant to every wind.” (Ezek. 5:10). But the Jews ignored God’s Word.
The lesson from the Jews’ mistakes is clear. When you rebel against
God’s Word, you will bring about suffering in your life. It may take a
different form. But it will be real.</p></li>

<u>Spiritual Blindness: Rebellion Against God Leads to Spiritual
Blindness</u>. 2 Kgs. 25:4-7.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar kills Zedekiah’s sons and blinds Zedekiah</u>.
Also as part of God’s judgment, Nebuchadnezzar captured Zedekiah, killed
his sons and blinded him: “<em><sup>4 </sup>Then the city was broken
into, and all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between
the two walls beside the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all
around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah. <sup>5 </sup>But
the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the
plains of Jericho and all his army was scattered from him.
<sup>6 </sup>Then they captured the king and brought him to the king of
Babylon at Riblah, and he passed sentence on him. <sup>7 </sup>They
slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put out the eyes
of Zedekiah and bound him with bronze fetters and brought him to
Babylon</em>.” (2 Kgs. 25:4-7). To breach the defenses of the walled
city, the Babylonians built a siege wall made of wood towers. In 586
B.C., during the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign, the Babylonians
breached the city’s defenses. During a diversion at night, Zedekiah and
his men escaped. They fled 20 miles until they were caught in the
Jericho plains. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah captive, killed his
sons, and blinded him. By killing the royal heirs, Nebuchadnezzar sought
to prevent a rebellion from a future king.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jewish nation failed at the place where it began</u>. The
Jewish nation entered the Promised Land on the plains of Jericho. “about
40,000 equipped for war, crossed for battle before the LORD to the
desert <em>plains of Jericho</em>.” (Josh. 4:13). On the same plains of
Jericho, the Jewish nation came to an official end: “But the army of the
Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the <em>plains of
Jericho</em>; and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence
on him.” (Jer. 39:5). This demonstrates that God was in control. He
gives, and He takes away. Thus, the Jews should never have taken His
gifts for granted.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar’s capture of Zedekiah fulfilled a prophecy</u>.
Zedekiah most likely believed that he had escaped judgment when he
reached the plains of Jericho. Yet, he could not escape God’s prophecies
of judgment against him. ‘“Then afterwards,’ declares the LORD, ‘<em>I
will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people,
even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword and
the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</em>, and
into the hand of their foes and into the hand of those who seek their
lives; and he will strike them down with the edge of the sword. He will
not spare them nor have pity nor compassion.”’ (Jer. 21:7).
“<sup>2</sup> Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was
besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court
of the guard, which <em>was in</em> the house of the king of Judah,
<sup>3</sup> because Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying,
‘Why do you prophesy, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am about
to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will take
it; <sup>4</sup> and <em>Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of
the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of
the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him
eye to eye</em>; <sup>5</sup> and he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and
he will be there until I visit him,’’’ declares the LORD. ‘If you fight
against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed’?” (Jer. 32:2-5). “‘You will
not escape from his hand, for you will surely be captured and delivered
into his hand; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he
will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.’” (Jer.
34:3) Yet, Zedekiah ignored these multiple specific warnings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar’s exile of Zedekiah fulfilled a prophecy</u>.
Jeremiah also prophesied that Zedekiah would not succeed in his revolt
against the Chaldeans from Babylon. It would instead result in him being
taken as a prisoner to Babylon: ‘“and <em>he will take Zedekiah to
Babylon</em>, and he will be there until I visit him,’ declares the
LORD. ‘If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed’?” (Jer.
32:5). Zedekiah also ignored this warning.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar’s blinding of Zedekiah also fulfilled a
prophecy</u>. The prophet Ezekiel also prophesied that Zedekiah would be
carried off to Babylon without ever seeing it: “I will also spread My
net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. And <em>I will bring
him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see
it</em>, though he will die there.” (Ezek. 12:13). The blinding of
Zedekiah fulfilled this prophecy. He would be sent to spend the rest of
his life as a prisoner in a foreign land without ever seeing
it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Zedekiah was spiritually blind to God’s Word</u>. Zedekiah
died as a blind prisoner in Babylon: “Then he blinded the eyes of
Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze fetters and
brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his
death.” (Jer. 52:11). This was a fulfillment of God’s Word. Zedekiah’s
physical blindness was the outward manifestation of the spiritual
blindness within him. “<sup>28 </sup>The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will smite you with madness and with
blindness and with bewilderment of heart; <sup>29 </sup>and you will
grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, and you will not
prosper in your ways; but you shall only be oppressed and robbed
continually, with none to save you.” (Dt. 28:27-29; Ex. 10:21). “We
grope along the wall like blind men, we grope like those who have no
eyes; we stumble at midday as in the twilight, . . .” (Is. 59:10(a)).
“By day they meet with darkness, and grope at noon as in the night.”
(Job 5:14; 12:25; 38:15). “They wandered, blind, in the streets; . .”
(Lam. 4:14(a). “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know
over what they stumble.” (Prov. 4:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Zedekiah could have survived and spared his people if he had
listened to Jeremiah</u>. God did not want to inflict suffering on
either Zedekiah or God’s people. Thus, God had the prophet Jeremiah tell
Zedekiah how he could be spared: “<sup>17 </sup>Then Jeremiah said to
Zedekiah, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of
hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If you will indeed go out to the officers of
the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned
with fire, and you and your household will survive. <sup>18 </sup>But if
you will not go out to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this
city will be given over to the hand of the Chaldeans; and they will burn
it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’’” (Jer.
38:17-18). Yet, Zedekiah refused to obey God’s Word: “<sup>19 </sup>Then
King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, ‘I dread the Jews who have gone over to
the Chaldeans, for they may give me over into their hand and they will
abuse me.’ <sup>20 </sup>But Jeremiah said, ‘They will not give you
over. Please obey the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in what I am
saying to you, that it may go well with you and you may live.” (Jer.
38:17-20). Again, Zedekiah refused to obey God’s Word. Even worse, he
prohibited Jeremiah from repeating God’s Word: “<sup>24 </sup>Then
Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, ‘Let no man know about these words and you
will not die.”’ (Jer. 38:24). The lesson here is clear. Rebellion
against God and His Word leads to spiritual blindness.</p></li>

<u>Bondage: Rebellion Against God’s Word Leads to Spiritual Bondage</u>.
2 Kgs. 25:8-12.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem and deported its people</u>.
Also as part of God’s judgment upon the people of Judah, He allowed
Nebuchadnezzar to burn Jerusalem, including God’s Temple, and deport the
Jews to Babylonian captivity: “<sup>8 </sup><em>Now on the seventh day
of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a
servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. <sup>9 </sup>He
burned the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the king’s
house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every great house he burned
with fire. <sup>10 </sup>So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with
the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
<sup>11 </sup>Then the rest of the people who were left in the city and
the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon and the rest of
the people, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away into
exile. <sup>12 </sup>But the captain of the guard left some of the
poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen</em>.” (2 Kgs.
25:8-12; 2 Chron. 36:17-19; Jer. 39:1-10; 52:1-23). Nebuchadnezzar
burned the great buildings of the city, including God’s Temple. They
then tore down the city’s walls. Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards,
then carried off the Jews into exile. He left behind only poor,
unskilled laborers. They would be unable to launch a new
revolt.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God purified His house with fire</u>. God allowed His Temple
to be burned with fire (2 Kgs. 24:9). This purified the Temple from the
false worship that had gone on within it. It also fulfilled a prophecy
that His house would be burned: “<sup>7 </sup>then I will cut off Israel
from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have
consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will
become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <sup>8 </sup>And this
house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be
astonished and hiss and say, ‘<em>Why has the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> done thus</em> to this land and <em>to
this house</em>?’” (1 Kgs. 9:7-8). God’s glory inhabited the Temple
since Solomon dedicated it. The Temple would now lay in ruins until the
exiles returned in Ezra’s day.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The exile of the Jews from Judah also fulfilled a
prophecy</u>. The Jews’ exile fulfilled a prophesy that Moses gave to
the Jews before they ever entered the Promised Land:
“<sup>64 </sup>Moreover, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will
scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other
end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone,
which you or your fathers have not known.” (Dt. 28:64). “The LORD will
scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among
the nations where the LORD drives you. There you will serve gods, the
work of man’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat
nor smell.” (Dt. 4:27-28; 29:28; 32:26). ‘“You, however, I will scatter
among the nations . . .” (Lev. 26:33(a)). To warn the people and to give
them an another opportunity to repent, the prophet Jeremiah also warned
that the Babylonians would soon send the people of Judah into exile:
‘“[Y]ou will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.”’ (Jer.
5:19(b)). “And you will, even of yourself, let go of your inheritance
that I gave you; and I will make you serve your enemies in the land
which you do not know; for you have kindled a fire in My anger which
will burn forever.” (Jer. 17:4). “ . . . All Judah has been carried into
exile, wholly carried into exile.” (Jer. 13:19(b)). “For thus says the
LORD, ‘Behold, I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to all
your friends; and while your eyes look on, they will fall by the sword
of their enemies. So I will give over all Judah to the hand of the king
of Babylon, and he will carry them away as exiles to Babylon and will
slay them with the sword.”’ (Jer. 20:4). “<sup>18 </sup>For thus says
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, “As
My anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
so My wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will
become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation and a reproach; and
you will see this place no more.” (Jer. 42:18). “Israel is a scattered
flock, the lions have driven them away. The first one who devoured him
was the king of Assyria, and this last one who has broken his bones is
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” (Jer. 50:17). “Remember the word which
You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful I will
scatter you among the peoples;”’ (Neh. 1:8). “Therefore, son of man,
prepare for yourself baggage for exile and go into exile by day in their
sight; even go into exile from your place to another place in their
sight.” (Ezek. 12:3(a)). “I will scatter you among the nations and I
will disperse you through the lands, and I will consume your uncleanness
from you.” (Ezek. 22:15). The Jews’ physical bondage was the outward
manifestation of their spiritual bondage to sin. When you rebel against
God’s Word, you may also be placed into spiritual bondage.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God humbled the wealthy and the powerful</u>. God carried off
the rich and powerful. He only spared the poor (2 Kgs. 24:14; Jer.
39:10). He repeatedly promised to save the humble and cast down the
proud: “When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, and the
humble person He will save.” (Job 22:29). “Pride goes before
destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18). “A
man’s pride will bring him low, . . .” (Prov. 29:23). “Whoever exalts
himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.”
(Matt. 23:12). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is
opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’” (Jam. 4:6). The
Jews’ pride had deceived them: ‘“ . . . The arrogance of your heart has
deceived you,’ . . . declares the LORD.” (Jer. 49:16). God again
fulfilled His Word.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar plunders Jerusalem</u>. In addition to carrying
off God’s people, Nebuchadnezzar looted Jerusalem of its wealth,
including the expensive parts of the Temple: “<sup>13 </sup><em>Now the
bronze pillars which were in the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the stands and the bronze sea which
were in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.
<sup>14 </sup>They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the
spoons, and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service.
<sup>15 </sup>The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and
the basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.
<sup>16 </sup>The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands which Solomon
had made for the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>—the
bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight. <sup>17 </sup>The height
of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a bronze capital was on it;
the height of the capital was three cubits, with a network and
pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second
pillar was like these with network</em>.” (2 Kgs. 25:13-17). God allowed
for everything of wealth that gave the Jews pride to be taken away. The
Jews became poor in spirit because what they cared about most was now
taken from them.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar’s looting of the wealth of Jerusalem also
fulfilled a prophecy</u>. Jeremiah’s warnings to the Jews also included
a specific warning that the Babylonians would cart off all of the Jews’
wealth if the Jews did not repent: “‘I will also give over all the
wealth of this city, all its produce and all its costly things; even all
the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give over to the hand of
their enemies, and they will plunder them, take them away and bring them
to Babylon.”’ (Jer. 20:5). God had also used His prophets to give
similar prophesies in the past: : “you shall build a house, but you will
not live in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but you will not use its
fruit.” <sup>31 </sup>Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but
you will not eat of it; your donkey shall be torn away from you, and
will not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies,
and you will have none to save you. . . . <sup>33 </sup>A people whom
you do not know shall eat up the produce of your ground and all your
labors, ” (Dt. 28:30(b)-31, 33(a)). “[Y]ou will sow your seed uselessly,
for your enemies will eat it up.” (Lev. 26:16(c)). “They will devour
your harvest and your food; . . They will devour your flocks and your
herds; they will devour your vines and your fig trees; . .” (Jer.
5:17(a)(c); Neh. 9:37; Ezek. 25:4). The looting of Jerusalem and Judah
was a fulfillment of these prophesies. Every precious metal or stone
that Solomon used for the Temple was now gone (1 Kgs. 7:15-49). This
even included the pots and pans from the Temple: “The captain of the
guard also took away the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the
lampstands, the pans and the drink offering bowls, what was fine gold
and what was fine silver.” (Jer. 52:19). When you rebel against God’s
Word, you will also feel empty and poor in spirit.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Nebuchadnezzar beats and kills the Jewish leaders</u>. To
prevent the Jews from rising up again, Nebuchadnezzar had his men beat
and kill the Jews’ spiritual, military, and civic leaders:
“<sup>18 </sup><em>Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief
priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the
temple. <sup>19 </sup>From the city he took one official who was
overseer of the men of war, and five of the king’s advisers who were
found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army who
mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land
who were found in the city. <sup>20 </sup>Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
<sup>21 </sup>Then the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to
death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led away into exile
from its land</em>.” (2 Kgs. 25:18-21). Only the lowly and the humble
were allowed to remain. The Jews would not return to retake their lands
until 538 B.C. after the Persians defeated Babylon. One commentator
observes: “[The Jews] had possessed this land for some 860 years; they
took it by faith and obedience but they lost it through idolatry and
sin.” (David Guzik on 2 Kgs. 25).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"
class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ slavery while in captivity fulfilled a prophecy</u>.
The Jews’ slavery in service to the Babylonians while in captivity
fulfilled a prophecy that Moses gave the Jews: “<sup>47 </sup>Because
you did not serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God with
joy and a glad heart, for the abundance of all things;
<sup>48 </sup>therefore <em>you shall serve your enemies</em> whom the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will send against you, <em>in
hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things</em>;”
(Dt. 28:47(a)). Jeremiah then repeated this prophecy: “And you will,
even of yourself, let go of your inheritance that I gave you; and I will
make you <em>serve your enemies in the land which you do not know</em>;
for you have kindled a fire in My anger which will burn forever.” (Jer.
17:4). “But they will become his slaves so that they may learn the
difference between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the
countries.” (2 Chr. 12:8). “Behold, <em>we are slaves today</em>, and as
to the land which You gave to our fathers to eat of its fruit and its
bounty, behold, we are slaves in it.” (Neh. 9:36).</p></li>

href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ suffering also fulfilled a prophecy</u>. The
suffering that the Jews experienced in captivity also fulfilled a
prophecy that Moses had given the Jews: “<sup>47 </sup> . . . and He
will put an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.” (Dt.
28:47(b)). Jeremiah then repeated this prophecy: “Go and speak to
Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, ‘You have broken the yokes of
wood, but you have made instead of them yokes of iron.’” (Jer. 28:13).
“The yoke of my transgressions is bound; by His hand they are knit
together. They have come upon my neck; He has made my strength fail. The
Lord has given me into the hands of those against whom I am not able to
stand.” (Lam. 1:14). “His own iniquities will capture the wicked, and he
will be held with the cords of his sin.” (Prov. 5:22). David summed up
the suffering caused by sin: “The cords of death encompassed me and the
terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow.” (Ps.
116:3). “For evils beyond number have surrounded me; my iniquities have
overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; they are more numerous than
the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed me.” (Ps. 40:12). Their
physical captivity was again the outward manifestation of their
spiritual captivity. In captivity, they felt deep despair from God’s
punishment.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ population collapse fulfilled a prophecy</u>. The
collapse of the Jewish population also fulfilled a prophecy that Moses
had given the Jews: “<sup>62 </sup>Then you shall be left few in number,
whereas you were as numerous as the stars of heaven, because you did not
obey the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God. <sup>63 </sup>It
shall come about that as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
delighted over you to prosper you, and multiply you, so the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will delight over you to make you perish
and destroy you; and you will be torn from the land where you are
entering to possess it.” (Dt. 28:62-63). This was the reverse of God’s
prior fertility blessing that allowed the Jews to become a vast
multitude of people and a great nation (Dt. 7:12-13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ despair fulfilled a prophecy</u>. The Jews’ feelings
of despair while being beaten as slaves and killed also fulfilled a
prophecy that Moses gave the Jews: “<sup>65 </sup>Among those nations
you shall find no rest, and there will be no resting place for the sole
of your foot; but there the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will
give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul.
<sup>66 </sup>So your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you will
be in dread night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
<sup>67 </sup>In the morning you shall say, ‘Would that it were
evening!’ And at evening you shall say, ‘Would that it were morning!’
because of the dread of your heart which you dread, and for the sight of
your eyes which you will see. <sup>68 </sup>The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by
the way about which I spoke to you, ‘You will never see it again!’ And
there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and
female slaves, but there will be no buyer.” (Dt. 28:65-68). Jeremiah
also repeated this prophecy: “And it shall be that when they say to you,
‘where should we go?’ then you are to tell them, ‘Thus says the LORD:
‘Those destined for death, to death; and those destined for the sword,
to the sword; and those destined for famine, to famine; and those
destined for captivity, to captivity.’’” (Jer. 15:2). Other prophets
also gave this warning: “This you will have from My hand: you will lie
down in torment.” (Is. 50:11(b)). “These two things have befallen you;
who will mourn for you? The devastation and destruction, famine and
sword; how shall I comfort you?” (Is. 51:19). If a nation or an
individual rejects God’s efforts to bring them back, He may also allow
them to feel the despair and hopelessness until they cry out for His
deliverance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Word is true and is always fulfilled</u>. Throughout the
Bible, God reveals that His Word is true and always comes to pass: “Not
one of the good promises which the LORD had made to the house of Israel
failed; all came to pass.” (Josh. 21:45). “Blessed be the LORD, who has
given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He promised; not
one word has failed of all His good promise, which He promised through
Moses His servant.” (1 Kgs. 8:56). “I declared the former things long
ago and they went forth from My mouth, and I proclaimed them. Suddenly I
acted, and they came to pass.” (Is. 48:3). “Behold, the former things
have come to pass, now I declare new things; before they spring forth I
proclaim them to you.” (Is. 42:9). No other holy book can make similar
claims of fulfilled prophecy as the Bible does. Nations ignore God’s
Word at their own peril. When a nation rejects God’s Word and rebels, He
will be forced to discipline it.</p></li>

<u>Helplessness: Rebellion Against God’s Word Leads to Helplessness</u>.
2 Kgs. 25:22-26.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Jews murder Gedaliah and then flee to Egypt in fear</u>.
With his God-given control over Judah, Nebuchadnezzar appointed a
God-fearing Jew named Gedaliah to govern. The Jews, however, rebelled
and murdered Gedaliah: “<sup>22 </sup><em>Now as for the people who were
left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left,
he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan over them.
<sup>23 </sup>When all the captains of the forces, they and their men,
heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they
came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and
Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the
Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their
men. <sup>24 </sup>Gedaliah swore to them and their men and said to
them, ‘Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans; live in the
land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you</em>.
<sup>25 </sup><em>But it came about in the seventh month, that Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came
with ten men and struck Gedaliah down so that he died along with the
Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. <sup>26 </sup>Then
all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces
arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans</em>.” (2
Kgs. 25:22-26; Jer. 40:7 – 41:18). The epilogue to the book of Kings
reveals that the people left behind in Judah continued to rebel. They
did not accept that God sent Nebuchadnezzar to judge them. Thus, they
rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar’s appointed governor Gedaliah, a Jew
from a well-known family (2 Kgs. 25:22). Gedaliah’s grandfather,
Shaphan, was famous within Judah for having implemented Josiah’s
religious reforms (2 Kgs. 22:3). Gedaliah’s father Ahikam also supported
the prophet Jeremiah (Jer. 26:24). Nebuchadnezzar also allowed Jeremiah
to give advice to Gedaliah as Nebuchadnezzar’s governor (Jer. 39:11-14;
40:1-6). Yet, to many Jews, Gedaliah was a traitor. Thus, in 586 B.C.
and only two months into Gedaliah’s governorship, a group led by Ishmael
conspired together to assassinate him. Ishmael’s grandfather served
under Jehoiakim (Jer. 36:12; 41:1). Ishmael likely sought to seize power
for himself. Because God had not ordained his coup and murder, the
conspirators became filled with fear and fled to Egypt (Jer. 40:7 –
43:7). The immigrants from Judah also included people who were not
involved in the conspiracy. All feared the Chaldean’s wrath (2 Kgs.
25:25-26). But they all suffered an even worse fate while living in
Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ rebellion and murder of Gedaliah was an evil
act</u>. Although fighting an evil pagan occupier might have seemed the
right thing to do, it was not God’s will. God sent the Jews into exile
as part of His plan to discipline and remold His people. In His
providence, God also gave Nebuchadnezzar temporary authority to rule
over Judah: “Now I have given all these lands into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have given him also
the wild animals of the field to serve him.” (Jer. 27:6; Hab. 1:5-2:8).
Gedaliah was also a God-fearing man who listened to God’s prophet (Jer.
26:24; 39:14). The Jews had no right to rebel against God’s appointed
leaders: “Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which
exist are established by God. (Ro. 13:1) “My son, fear the LORD and the
king; do not associate with those who are given to change,” (Prov.
24:21). “Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the
king.” (1 Pet. 2:17). By murdering God’s appointed governor, the Jews
brought judgment upon themselves: “Therefore whoever resists authority
has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive
condemnation upon themselves.” (Ro. 13:2). Most scholars believe that
the Jews who fled to Egypt suffered greatly living there.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ weakness and fear fulfilled a prophecy</u>. Moses
warned the people that their rebellion against God would cause them to
feel weak and powerless against their foreign enemies: “As for those of
you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the
lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them,
and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the
sword, and they will fall.” (Lev. 26:36). “<sup>26 </sup>Your carcasses
will be food to all birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth, and
there will be no one to frighten them away.” (Dt. 28:26). The prophet
Jeremiah repeated these warnings: “I will make void the counsel of Judah
and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword
before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I
will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the
beasts of the earth.” (Jer. 19:7; 7:33; Ps. 79:2). “The LORD has done
what He purposed; He has accomplished His word which He commanded from
days of old. . . . He has exalted the might of your adversaries.” (Lam.
2:17). “The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, but the righteous are
bold as a lion.” (Prov. 28:1). When a nation rebels against God and His
Word, it will feel helpless against His judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God judges those who reject His mercy and grace</u>. God’s
judgment upon the Jews who were spared exile shows that He must
ultimately judge those who reject His mercy and grace. Judgment will
begin with His people. It will then reach all nonbelievers as well. “For
it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it
begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey
the gospel of God?” (1 Pet. 4:17). “For after all it is only just for
God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to give relief
to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be
revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out
retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey
the gospel of our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1:6-8). The prospect of
judgment should cause all believers to warn non-believers to repent.
This includes both prayer and evangelism. You can pray for
non-believers. You can share God’s Word. You can also pay to support and
encourage God’s missionaries. You can also live as an example of God’s
light. How are you fulfilling Jesus’ Great Commission? (Matt.
28:16-20).</p></li>

<u>Mercy: Rebellion Against God Leads to the Need for Mercy and
Grace</u>. 2 Kgs. 25:27-30.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Evil-merodach releases Jehoiachin from prison</u>. In order to
preserve David’s line for the future Messiah, God influenced the new
king Evil-merodach to release King Jehoiachin from prison and to allow
him to live: “<sup>27 </sup><em>Now it came about in the thirty-seventh
year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on
the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon,
in the year that he became king, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from
prison; <sup>28 </sup>and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne
above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
<sup>29 </sup>Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and had his meals in
the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life;
<sup>30 </sup>and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him
by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life</em>.” (2
Kgs. 25:27-30). Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive after he rebelled
against Babylonian rule (2 Kgs. 24:10-12) Following Nebuchadnezzar’s
death in 561 B.C., his successor Evil-Merodach (562-560 B.C.). sought to
gain favor with the Jews by releasing the imprisoned King Jehoiachin and
treating him kindly. Jehoiachin had been a prisoner for 36 years at the
time he was released. This act preserved the line of David for the
Messiah to come. It also foreshadowed the Jews’ future release from
captivity (2 Chron. 36:22-23; Ezra 1-2). Babylonian records further
confirm that these events are historically accurate.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to preserve a remnant of His people</u>.
Whenever God allowed calamity to fall upon His people to correct or
discipline them, He always promised to preserve a “remnant” that He
would use to restore His people “For out of Jerusalem will go forth
<em>a remnant</em> and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD
of hosts will perform this.”’ (Is. 37:32; Micah 2:12-13; Zeph. 3:8-20).
Through Paul, God repeated this promise: “In the same way then, there
has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God’s
gracious choice.” (Ro. 11:5). Thus, even when evil abounds, you should
never give up hope in Jesus. He will preserve a remnant to keep His
promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to preserve His everlasting covenant leading
to Jesus</u>. God promised David an everlasting covenant:
“<sup>13 </sup>He shall build a house for My name, and <em>I will
establish the throne of his kingdom forever</em>.” (2 Sam. 7:13). In
their time of darkness, the prophet Jeremiah encouraged the people that
God could not break His promises: “Thus says the LORD, ‘If you can break
My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and
night will not be at their appointed time, then My covenant may also be
broken with David My servant so that he will not have a son to reign on
his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers.”’ (Jer.
33:20-21; 2 Chr. 21:7). By preserving Jehoiachin, God showed that He was
faithful to keep His covenant. Jesus is the eternal King of Kings who
came through David’s line to fulfill God’s “<em>everlasting
covenant”</em> (2 Sam. 23:5) “He will be great and will be called the
Son of the Most High; and <em>the Lord God will give Him the throne of
His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob
forever</em>, <em>and His kingdom will have no end</em>.” (Lk. 1:32-33).
“There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on
the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold
it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal
of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:7). “These will wage
war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is
Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the
called and chosen and faithful.” (Rev. 17:14). Thus, God is faithful to
keep His promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to heal His people and return them to the
Promised Land</u>. God was faithful to send a remnant back to the
Promised Land. “For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not
forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the
kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God,
to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.”
(Ezra 9:9). “He also made them objects of compassion in the presence of
all their captors.” (Ps. 106:46). He promises to restore His people if
they repent of their sins: “and My people who are called by My name
humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked
ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal
their land.” (2 Chr. 7:14). If our nation will repent and return back to
God, God promises to heal it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You also can trust in His promises to you</u>. The accuracy of
God’s promises in the book of Kings show how you can also trust His
promises for you as well. “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also
will bring it to pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). “Know therefore that the LORD
your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His
lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and
keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “God is faithful, through whom you
were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1
Cor. 1:9). He is faithful even when you are not: “If we are faithless,
He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have
you given thanks that you can trust in His faithfulness in your
life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ mercy and grace</u>. The Jews’
rebellions and suffering showed their need for God’s mercy and grace.
Like the Jews, all have sinned against God (Ro. 3:23). Like the Jews,
all are in need of divine mercy and grace that only Jesus can
provide.</p></li>
