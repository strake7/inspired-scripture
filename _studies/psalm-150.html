<h1 id="psalm-150-lessons-from-the-conclusion-to-the-psalms-for-praising-jesus-with-every-breath-that-he-gives-you"><strong>Psalm 150: Lessons from the Conclusion to the Psalms For Praising Jesus With Every Breath That He Gives You</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 150 concludes the book of Psalms with a culmination of praise for Yahweh. “From the opening to the closing ‘hallelujah,’ the Hebrew term <em>hallel</em> [praise] occurs in every single line of Ps 150. In the mere six verses of this psalm, the <em>hallel</em> root occurs thirteen times, nine consecutive instances of the term have the third-person singular suffix that can be translated ‘praise him’ (<span dir="rtl">תְּהַלֵּ֥ל</span>). Psalms 146-150 each open and close with ‘hallelujah,’ and there are instances of <em>hallel</em> interspersed through these psalms, but Ps 150 is a crescendo of hallelujahs.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 150).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Jesus came to fulfill the Psalms and every other book of the Bible. “Now He said to them, ‘These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and <em>the Psalms must be fulfilled</em>.”’ (Lk. 24:44). From Psalm 150, the Bible urges you to praise Jesus: (1) in His house, (2) for His omnipotence, (3) for His Works, (4) for His holy Character, (5) with joy, (6) to evangelize, and (7) as long as you live. In short, it is your most important activity.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist called upon every living creature to praise Yahweh “<em>in His sanctuary</em>”. This will apply both in heaven and on Earth. Until you get to heaven, you can praise Jesus with other believers in church-related settings. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist urged every living creature to praise God “<em>in His mighty expanse</em>.” This referred to His expansive creation. This also suggested that you can praise Jesus for His loving omnipotence and everywhere you may go within His creation. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist urged praise for Yahweh’s “<em>mighty deeds.</em>” You can praise Jesus for His deeds that include creation, redemption, salvation, provision, protection, healing, and encouragement to name a few.  <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist urged praise for Yahweh’s “<em>excellent greatness</em>.” This is in reference to who Yahweh is. You can praise Jesus for His awesome and holy character. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist urged praise for Yahweh with “<em>trumpet sound,” “harp and lyre</em>,” <em>“tambourine and</em> dancing,” and “<em>stringed instruments and flute</em>.” You can offer Jesus joyful praise to show your gratitude. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist urged praise for Yahweh with “<em>loud</em>” and “<em>resounding cymbals</em>.” This meant that the music was coordinated with other believers and loud enough for both nonbelievers and the broken-hearted to hear it. You can offer Jesus joyful praise in unity with believers as a witness to the lost and to encourage others. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist commanded “<em>everything that has breath shall praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>” Every person should offer praise as long as you have God-given breath to offer it. It is your most important activity.</p>
<h2 id="his-house-praise-jesus-with-other-believers-in-church-settings.-ps.-1501a."><strong>1. <u>His House: Praise Jesus with Other Believers in Church Settings</u>. Ps. 150:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>In heaven and on Earth, Jesus will be praised in His sanctuary</u>. The psalmist began this final psalm with a command for all created beings to praise Yahweh in His sanctuary, both in heaven and on Earth. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Praise God in His sanctuary</em>;…” (Ps. 150:1a). “Praise begins at home. ‘In God’s own house pronounce his praise.’ The holy place should be filled with praise, even as of old the high priest filled the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> with the smoke of sweet smelling incense. In his church below and in his courts above hallelujahs should be continually presented. In the person of Jesus God finds a holy dwelling or sanctuary, and there he is greatly to be praised. He may also be said to dwell in holiness, for all his ways are right and good; for this we ought to extol him with heart and with voice. Whenever we assemble for holy purposes our main work should be to present praises unto the Lord our God.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 150:1a).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship shows your love for Jesus</u>.  Memorizing Jesus’ Word helps to keep your head aligned with Him. Worship helps to keep your heart aligned with Jesus as well.  Saint Augustine, who lived between 354 to 430 A.D., wrote how the Psalms brought him to a place where he could do nothing but turn to Jesus and worship Him:  “In what accounts I addressed Thee, my God, when I read the Psalms of David, those faithful songs, the language of devotion which banishes the spirit of pride . . . How I addressed Thee in those Psalms!  How my love for Thee was kindled by them!  How I burned to recite them, were it possible, throughout the world, as an antidote for the pride of humanity.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t forsake the joy of worshiping Jesus with other believers in church-related settings</u>. Many claim that they do not need to go to church to worship Jesus. Many also feel no pressure to arrive at church on time to participate in church worship. But believers are warned to not forsake the fellowship that comes from worshiping together with other believers at church and church-related activities. “not abandoning our own meeting together, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:25). “In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,” (1 Cor. 5:4).</p></li>

<h2 id="his-omnipotence-praise-jesus-as-being-your-all-powerful-loving-god-wherever-you-may-be-located.-ps.-1501b."><strong>2. <u>His Omnipotence: Praise Jesus as Being Your All-Powerful Loving God Wherever You May Be Located</u>. Ps. 150:1b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus’ Awesome power wherever you go within His creation</u>. After praising Yahweh in His sanctuary, the psalmist extended the command to all persons and angelic beings wherever they may be within His vast expanse. “… <em>praise Him in His mighty expanse</em>.” (Ps. 150:1b). “Praise the holy God who dwells in His holy heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm"><u>Psalm 20:6</u></a>), the firmament which is His handiwork and the witness to His omnipotence.” (Alexander Francis Kirkpatrick, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Ps. 150:1b).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Through Jesus and the Holy Spirit, the command to praise extends everywhere</u>. The command to praise Yahweh both in His sanctuary and <em>“in His mighty expanse</em>” suggests that praise should happen everywhere (Ps. 150:1b). Through faith in Jesus, your body becomes the temple for the Holy Spirit. “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?” (1 Cor. 6:19). Thus, you can and should praise Jesus wherever you go. “The <strong>sanctuary</strong> of God is a most fitting place for His <strong>praise</strong>. It is a place set apart for His honor, and involves special recognition of His presence. If Yahweh is to be praised anywhere, it should be in <strong>His sanctuary</strong>. In light of the New Covenant, we realize that God’s <strong>sanctuary</strong> is not fixed to a particular building in Jerusalem. · Jesus serves His people in a sanctuary in the heavens (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Hebrews+8.1-2&amp;t=NKJV">Hebrews 8:1-2</a>). · Jesus makes His sanctuary among His people collectively (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Corinthians+6.16&amp;t=NKJV">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). · Jesus makes His sanctuary in the individual believer (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+3.16&amp;t=NKJV">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). · Ultimately, Jesus Himself will be the sanctuary of God among His people (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Revelation+21.22&amp;t=NKJV">Revelation 21:22</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 150:1).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His creation</u>. Here, the psalmist praised Yahweh for the expanse that He created (Ps. 150:1; Gen. 1:1). The psalmists regularly praised Yahweh for His omnipotent and loving power that can clearly be seen through His creation. “A Psalm of David. The heavens tell of the glory of God; and their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). “By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their lights.” (Ps. 33:6). “They are to praise the name of the LORD, for He commanded and they were created.” (Ps. 148:5). You can praise Jesus for the creation He provided out of love to mankind. “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” (Rev. 4:11; Col. 1:16; Jo. 1:1-3; Heb. 11:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to Jesus’ power to boost your faith in times when it is weak</u>.  Jesus wants you to trust in His absolute power to solve your problems.  He also wants you to boost your faith by including similar praises for His mighty power in your prayers and praises (Ro. 10:17).  ‘“Ah Lord GOD!  Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm!  Nothing is too difficult for You,’ . . . ‘Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”’  (Jer. 32:17, 27).  “And looking at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’  (Matt. 19:26; Gen. 18:14).  If Jesus does not respond to your prayer requests, it may be because you are asking amiss or it is not His will.  Yet, if He does not respond, it will never be because He lacks the power to do so.  </p></li>

<h2 id="his-works-praise-jesus-for-his-amazing-works.-ps.-1502a."><strong>3. <u>His Works: Praise Jesus for His Amazing Works</u>. Ps. 150:2a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His mighty deeds</u>. After commanding where praise should happen, the psalmist stated why Yahweh is worthy of praise. This begins with His mighty deeds. “<strong><sup>2a </sup></strong><em>Praise Him for His mighty deeds</em>; … ” (Ps. 150:2a). “Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; and <em>His greatness is unsearchable</em>.” (Ps. 145:3). “The works of his power (v. 2): <em>Praise him for his mighty acts;</em> for <em>his mightinesses</em> (so the word is), for all the instances of his might, the power of his providence, the power of his grace, what he has done in the creation, government, and redemption of the world, for the children of men in general, for his own church and children in particular.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 150).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for all His grace</u>. You can praise Jesus for His grace, the gifts that you do not deserve. “Bless the LORD, my soul, and do not forget any of His benefits;” (Ps. 103:2). “What shall I repay to the LORD for all His benefits to me?” (Ps. 116:12). Out of grace, Jesus provides for your every need when you place your trust in Him. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great;” (Matt. 5:3-12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His mercy, forgiveness, and compassion</u>. You can also praise Jesus for His mercy, the withheld punishment that you do deserve. “The LORD’S acts of mercy indeed do not end, for His compassions do not fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.” (Lam. 3:22-23). “Nevertheless, in Your great compassion You did not make an end of them or abandon them, for You are a gracious and compassionate God.” (Neh. 9:31). When you confess your sins, Jesus will bless you with mercy and forgiveness: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His faithfulness</u>. You can also praise Jesus for His faithfulness. “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His faithfulness to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the graciousness of the LORD forever; to all generations I will make Your faithfulness known with my mouth.” (Ps. 89:1). “Your faithfulness continues throughout generations; You established the earth, and it stands.” (Ps. 119:90).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for your salvation</u>. You can also praise Jesus for making your salvation possible. “Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!” (2 Cor. 9:15). “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 88:13). “For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.” (Ps. 116:8). “I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the LORD.” (Ps. 118:17). The promise of eternal life included eternal joy: “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever<em>.”</em> (Ps. 16:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Each generation has new reasons to praise Jesus for His mighty works</u>. With the Jews, each generation experienced Yahweh’s mercy, grace, deliverance, provision, protection, and other blessings. Today, each generation also has new reasons to praise Jesus for His amazing works on their behalf. “Praise him for his mighty acts - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-4.htm"><u>Psalm 145:4</u></a> : ‘One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.’ The Hebrew word is the same. The reference is to that which displays the power of God; the things which manifest his omnipotence.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 150:2b).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His amazing name and His holy character</u>. In addition to praising Yahweh for what He has done, the psalmist urged everyone to praise Him for who He is. “<strong><sup>2b </sup></strong>… <em>praise Him according to His excellent greatness</em>.” (Ps. 150:2b). “Not that our praises can bear any proportion to God’s greatness, for it is infinite, but because he is greater than we can express or conceive, we must raise our conceptions and expressions to the highest degree to which we can attain. We must not be afraid of saying too much in the praises of God, as we often do in praising even great and good men; all the danger is, of our saying too little; ….” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Ps. 150:2b).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmists praised Yahweh because of His holy character</u>. Even if God had not blessed the Jews with mercy, grace, provision, and deliverance, the psalmists taught the Jews to praise Him because of who He is. This included praise for God’s “glory” and “His name,” a reference to His perfect, holy character. “I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness and will <em>sing praise to the name</em> of the Lord most high.”  (Ps. 7:17).  “I will be glad and exult in You; I will <em>sing praise to Your name</em>, O Most High.”  (Ps. 9:2). “Ascribe to the Lord <em>the glory due to His name</em>; worship the Lord in holy array.”  (Ps. 29:2).  “O magnify the Lord with me, and <em>let us exalt His name together</em>.”  (Ps. 34:3). “<em>Sing the glory of His name</em>; make His praise glorious.”  (Ps. 66:2).  “Sing to God, <em>sing praises to His name</em>; lift up a song for Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the Lord, and exult before Him.”  (Ps. 68:4).   “<em>My mouth is filled with Your praise and with Your glory all day long</em>.” (Ps. 71:8). “God is known in Judah; <em>His name is great</em> in Israel.” (Ps. 76:1).  “All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and <em>they shall glorify Your name</em>.”  (Ps. 86:9).  “A Psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.  It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to <em>sing praises to Your name</em>, O Most High;”  (Ps. 92:1). “A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name.” (Ps. 103:1). “Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Glorify Jesus’ Holy name</u>.  Jesus also instructs believers to give glory to God’s name: “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father who is in heaven, <em>hallowed be Your name…</em>”  (Matt. 6:9).  Jesus is worthy of your complete devotion and loving admiration.  One day all creation will bow down and praise Jesus’ holy name: “so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,” (Phil. 2:10). “And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.’” (Rev. 5:13). Give glory to Jesus because He is holy, loving, merciful, and just.</p></li>

<h2 id="joy-offer-jesus-joyful-praise-to-show-your-gratitude.-ps.-1503-4."><strong>5. <u>Joy: Offer Jesus Joyful Praise to Show Your Gratitude</u>. Ps. 150:3-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus with joy</u>. After stating the where and why of praise, the psalmist stated how Yahweh should be praised. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Praise Him with trumpet sound; praise Him with harp and lyre. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; praise Him with stringed instruments and flute</em>.” (Ps. 150:3-4). “<em>Praise him with the timbrel and dance.</em> Associated with the deliverance at the Red Sea, this form of worship set forth the most jubilant and exultant of worship. The hands and feet were both employed, and the entire body moved in sympathy with the members. Are there not periods of life when we feel so glad that we would fain dance for joy? Let not such exhilaration be spent upon common themes, but let the name of God stir us to ecstasy.” (Charles Spurgeon, Ps. 150:4).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship that includes musical instruments, singing, and dancing should express your joy</u>. God’s Law included obligations for the Jews to express their gratitude through proper worship (Dt. 12:7, 12, 18; 14:26; 16:11-15; 26:11; 27:7).  But God hates worship when it is done out of obligation (Is. 1:14).  In other words, God wants your head and your heart aligned in the right place when you approach Him.  To set the Jews’ hearts for proper worship, David led the Jews with both psalms and songs of heartfelt praise and thanksgiving: “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His faithfulness is everlasting.”  (1 Chr. 16:34).  “Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might, with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets.”  (1 Chr. 13:8).  The Psalms also encourage believers to praise God with both songs and musical instruments:  “It is good to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to Your name, Most High; to declare Your goodness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night, with the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, with resounding music on the lyre.  For You, LORD, have made me joyful by what You have done, I will sing for joy over the works of Your hands.”  (Ps. 92:104).  When you worship with your church, the music should also express the Spirit-led joy within you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The two choirs of praise gathered to celebrate the rebuilt Jerusalem</u>. Many of the final psalms were drafted during the post-exile period when Ezra and Nehemiah led the Jews in rebuilding Jerusalem. At the dedication of Jerusalem’s rebuilt walls, believers gathered with one accord to worship. Nehemiah recorded how worship leaders gathered the priests, singers, musicians at each of the ten gates (Neh. 12:31-42). Jesus proclaimed that a matter is confirmed by two or more witnesses (Matt. 18:16; 2 Cor. 13:1; 1 Tim. 5:19; Heb. 10:28; Dt. 17:6; 19:15). The two choirs served as confirmation that God was worthy of everyone’s praise. They further stood at each of the ten gates leading into the heart of Jerusalem. This symbolized praise for every part of their lives.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus publicly with others as led by the Spirit to evangelize and encourage</u>. In addition to being joyful, worship should be unified and audible for God’s light to reach the lost and the broken-hearted. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Praise Him with loud cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals</em>.” (Ps. 150:5). “The mention of ‘cymbals’ is reserved to the last, as being the instrument of music most expressive of joy and jubilation. It completes the musical climax, as ver. 6 completes the ideal one.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 150:5).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>As led by the Spirit, worship with one accord</u>. In most cases, a church choir is only pleasing to listen to when the choir members sing on key and at the appointed times. In the same way, worship becomes the best witness for Jesus’ light when believers sing together with one accord, as led by the Holy Spirit. “That, various instruments being used in praising God, it should yet be done with an exact and perfect harmony; they must not hinder, but help one another. The New-Testament concert, instead of this, is <em>with one mind and one mouth to glorify God,</em> Rom. 15:6.” (Matthew Henry on Ps.150:3-5).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Joyful worship helps to evangelize the lost</u>. As part of the dedication of Jerusalem’s rebuilt walls, the Jews worshiped together so loudly that their worship music could be heard far away from Jerusalem, “and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, and the women and children rejoiced as well, <em>so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.”</em> (Neh. 12:43). The Jews were meant to return to Jerusalem and joyfully proclaim God’s light to the gentiles: “Go out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! <em>Declare with the sound of joyful shouting</em>, proclaim this, <em>send it out to the end of the earth</em>; say, ‘The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob.”’ (Is. 48:20). The Jews were also to be God’s light to the lost through their witness, which included worship: “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”’ (Is. 49:6). Today, believers are to represent Jesus’ light (Matt. 5:14). Those who feel embarrassed to publicly worship fail to appreciate its role in evangelism. Worship should entice non-believers to see Jesus’ light. Worship can also uplift and encourage the brokenhearted. Is your worship a witness to the lost and an encouragement to others?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Let every being praise Jesus with their every breath</u>. The psalmist concluded with a simple and straightforward command: “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Everything that has breath shall praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 150:6). In a prior concluding psalm, the psalmist declared that he would praise Yahweh as long as he lived. “I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.” (Ps. 146:2). Jesus created you to be in fellowship with Him. In turn, He deserves continuous praise. “In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will, to the end that we who were the first to hope in the Christ would be to the praise of His glory.” (Eph. 1:11-12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praising Jesus is the most important thing you can do as long as you have breath</u>. “The sixth verse provides the concluding statement, not only for Psalm 150, but for the entire book: … ‘The word ‘breath’ (<span dir="rtl">הַ֭נְּשָׁמָה</span>) is critical to this psalm; it is a term that is essentially a provision from God for human life. In addition to describing the breath of life, i.e., that which make the human a living being (see Gen. 2:7), the word is used in different places in Scripture to indicate that when God imparted breath to humans they received the capacity for spiritual understanding (Job 34:8) and for distinguishing between what is right and wrong (Prov. 20:22), aspects necessary to the praise of God. Every person, not just Israel, must praise the LORD. Here then is the glory of creation. God gave humans breath, and so they owe their breath to him, making praise the primary reason they have it. The call is for the breath to be used in this way.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 150:6).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your continuous praise for Jesus should not be limited to the times when you are happy</u>. The greatest leaders in the Bible praised God in both good and bad times. When Saul was trying to kill David, David declared that he would always praise God: “A Psalm of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.” (Ps. 34:1). When Daniel learned that the king had signed an order that would result in him being thrown in the lion’s den, he continued in his regular praises: “Now when Daniel learned that the document was signed, he entered his house (and in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously.” (Dan. 6:10). Even in times when he was jailed and persecuted, Paul worshiped God: “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to <em>our</em> God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20). Do you worship Jesus in both good and bad times?</p></li>

<p>As long as Jesus blesses you with breath, use it to praise Him<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>In heaven, every being will offer continuous praise to Jesus</u>. Does the praise end when believers die and give their last breath on Earth? Not at all. In heaven, each believer will receive a new and incorruptible body (2 Cor. 5:1-10; Rev. 21:1-4). Believers will then join with the angels to offer Jesus an eternity of glorious praise in heaven. “<em>And I heard every created thing which is in heaven</em>, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘<em>To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever</em>.”’ (Rev. 5:13).</p></li>
