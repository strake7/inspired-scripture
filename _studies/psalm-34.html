<h1 id="psalm-34-when-you-are-attacked-lessons-for-seeking-gods-deliverance">Psalm 34: When You Are Attacked, Lessons For Seeking God’s Deliverance</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This psalm recounts David’s praise for God during one of the darkest times in his life. When Saul tried to kill him, instead of turning to God, David fled to his enemy. When his enemy then tried to kill him, David faked insanity before King Achish. Out of grace, God spared David. David was so overcome with gratitude that he wrote this psalm. From David’s example, God reveals seven lessons for seeking His deliverance when you are attacked. These include: (1) praise, (2) dependence, (3) fearing God, (4) righteousness, (5) prayer, (6) humility, and (7) faith.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, even though David had sinned, God saved David from his enemy. David responded by giving God the praise. When you are attacked, take your eyes off yourself and turn to God with praise. <u>Second</u>, God delivered David when he depended upon Him for his protection. When you are attacked, God also wants you to depend upon Him alone for your deliverance. <u>Third</u>, David encouraged others to learn from his mistakes by fearing God and hating evil. When you are attacked, God also wants you to show your reverence to Him by hating what He calls evil. <u>Fourth</u>, based on his own mistakes, David also encouraged others to pursue after God’s righteousness. When you are attacked, God does not want you to respond to evil with evil. Instead, He also wants you to pursue His righteousness and trust Him to take care of you. <u>Fifth</u>, David also encouraged others that God hears the cries of the righteous. You can praise Jesus because He makes you righteous to have your prayers heard. <u>Sixth</u>, David encouraged others that God is near to the brokenhearted. When you are attacked, humble yourself before God, and He will be there for you. <u>Finally</u>, David encouraged others that God will redeem the souls of His servants. When you are attacked, have faith in Jesus, and He will deliver your soul from death.</p>
<h2 id="praise-when-you-are-attacked-turn-to-god-with-praise.-ps.-341-2.">1. <u>Praise: When You Are Attacked, Turn to God With Praise</u>. Ps. 34:1-2.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God’s mercy and grace for saving him</u>. Because David took refuge with the enemy instead of God, he felt the need to turn to deceit to save himself from death: “<em>A Psalm of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I will bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>My soul will make its boast in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; the humble will hear it and rejoice</em>.” (Ps. 34:1-2). At this point, David was in a dark place. He “had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-31.htm">1 Samuel 20:31</a>). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>). He had as yet no body of followers.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 34:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David had sinned and knew that he had no reason to boast</u>. Some might think that the ends justify the means in desperate times. But God cannot lie (Nu. 23:19). Jesus made clear that lies and deceit are instead tools of the father of lies, the devil (Jo. 8:44). Thus, David used the devil’s tools when he used deceit to win his freedom: “Then David set out and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath. . . . So he disguised his sanity while in their sight and acted insanely in their custody, and he scribbled on the doors of the gate, and drooled on his beard. Then Achish said to his servants, ‘Look, you see the man is behaving like an insane person. Why do you bring him to me?”’ (1 Sam. 21:10, 13-14). Because God does not deceive, He saved David by grace alone.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because all have sinned, only boast about God and never about yourself</u>. Because he had sinned, David knew that he had no reason to boast. He would instead boast about God: “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>My soul will make its boast in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em><span class="smallcaps">.” (Ps. 34:2.). “</span>In God we have boasted all day long, and we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah” (Ps. 44:8). The Apostle Paul later quoted David and advised that David’s conclusion applies to all believers because everyone has sinned and fallen short: “so that, just as it is written: ‘Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”’ (1 Cor. 1:31). Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from God (Jam. 1:17). Thus, you should never boast about your accomplishments.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David was a man of God because he always praised God</u>. As our example, David turned to God to praise Him whenever David was attacked: “A Psalm of David. I will exalt You, LORD, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:1). “A Psalm of Praise, of David. I will exalt You, my God, the King, and I will bless Your name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:1). “I cried to Him with my mouth, and He was exalted with my tongue.” (Ps. 66:17). “I will praise the name of God with song, and exalt Him with thanksgiving.” (Ps. 69:30). “You are my God, and I give thanks to You; You are my God, I exalt You.” (Ps. 118:28). When you praise God during your trials, you take your eyes off yourself, and you give Him your burdens and worries.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Even when things appear hopeless, turn to God with praise</u>. Daniel once faced a seemingly hopeless circumstance when a Babylonian King signed his death warrant. As our example, Daniel took his worries off of himself by praising God: “Now when Daniel learned that the document was signed, he entered his house (and in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously.” (Dan. 6:10). You should also respond to any trial by praising God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God in all circumstances</u>. The Apostle Paul praised God when he was thrown into prison. He exhorted believers to praise God in every circumstance: “I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,” (1 Cor. 1:4). “First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, . . .” (Ro. 1:8a). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20). “in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.” (Col. 3:17). Are you praising God during both good times and during your trials?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God’s grace is big enough to deliver any sinner</u>. Here, David acted like Abraham. Both lied foolishly out of fear. Both foolishly sought refuge with an enemy when they faced danger. God then had to deliver both through His grace (Gen. 12:17-20). If God could forgive their sins, give thanks that He can also forgive and deliver you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God in your suffering because your suffering is likely for His greater good</u>. God allowed David to suffer in the wilderness so that he would learn to cling to Him and trust Him. God also wanted to humble David so that he would not become prideful when God later exalted him. Just as God allowed David to suffer for His greater good, He also allows you to suffer for His greater good as well. “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28). Just as David later praised God in his suffering, so should you. “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.” (Ja. 1:2-3). The only exception to this rule is if you have brought suffering upon yourself because of your sins. Yet, even in the case of sin, your suffering serves God’s greater purpose if it brings you to repentance. If you are suffering, sing God’s praises and give thanks. He may be molding you for something great. If you complain, what kind of a witness are you?</p></li>

<h2 id="dependence-when-you-are-attacked-depend-upon-god-alone.-ps.-343-6.">2. <u>Dependence: When You Are Attacked, Depend Upon God Alone</u>. Ps. 34:3-6.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for hearing his cries for help</u>. Because David turned to God, God delivered him. David was so overcome with gratitude that he sang God’s praises: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Exalt the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with me, and let’s exalt His name together. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>I sought the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and He answered me, and rescued me from all my fears. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>They looked to Him and were radiant, and their faces will never be ashamed. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>This wretched man cried out, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</em>” (Ps. 34:3-6). David saw himself as a “<em>wretched man</em>.” Only by fully depending upon God did he find deliverance. Because he depended upon God, he was filled with God’s “<em>radiance</em>.” (Ps. 34:5; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Turn to God for deliverance from fear<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you are in the wilderness, depend upon God to deliver you</u>. This time in David’s life paralleled the Jews’ time in the wilderness when they fled from Egypt. The Jews fled from their old lives with nothing but their faith. David also fled from his old life with nothing but his faith. While in the wilderness, enemies pursued the Jews in an effort to kill them. While he was in the wilderness, enemies also pursued after David in an effort to kill him. Like the Jews, God took David into the wilderness to test him, to mold him, and prepare him. Also like the Jews, David stumbled when God brought him into the wilderness. But David repented and learned from his errors. Indeed, many of his mistakes gave him the inspiration to write his many psalms to God. When you find yourself in a wilderness, turn to God for your deliverance and praise Him when he does.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David regularly cried out in faith for God’s help</u>. In complete dependence upon God, David cried out: “<em>This wretched man cried out.</em>” (Ps. 34:6). As a man who completely depended upon God, David regularly cried out in his prayers for God’s help: “<em>I was crying out to the LORD</em> with my voice, and He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah” (Ps. 3:4). “<em>Hear, LORD, when I cry</em> with my voice, and be gracious to me and answer me.” (Ps. 27:7). “A Psalm of David. <em>Hear my cry, God</em>; give Your attention to my prayer.” (Ps. 61:1). “<em>Save me from the lion’s mouth</em>; . . .” (Ps. 22:21). “<em>Rescue my soul from their ravages</em>, my only life from the lions.” (Ps. 34:17b). “A Maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, God; and do not hide Yourself from my pleading.” (Ps. 55:1). “Hear my prayer, God; listen to the words of my mouth.” (Ps. 54:2). “Listen, LORD, to my prayer; and give Your attention to the sound of my pleading!” (Ps. 86:6). “I said to the LORD, ‘You are my God; listen, LORD, to the sound of my pleadings.” (Ps. 140:6). Like David, you can you show your dependence on God by crying out for His help.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Depend upon God, and He will strengthen you</u>. When you are weak in the face of your trials, God will strengthen you: “But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth.” (2 Tim. 4:17). If you feel beaten down, tired, or weary from your trials, depend upon God to strengthen you.</p></li>

<h2 id="fearing-god-when-you-are-attacked-fear-god-by-hating-evil.-ps.-347-11.">3. <u>Fearing God: When You Are Attacked, Fear God by Hating Evil</u>. Ps. 34:7-11.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David urged believers to show their gratitude by avoiding evil</u>. On four separate occasions, David urged believers to “fear God” and enjoy His blessings of protection: “<strong><sup>7<em> </em></sup></strong><em>The angel of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them</em>. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>Taste and see that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you His saints; for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will not lack any good thing</em>. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</em>” (Ps. 34:7-11). David might have been viewed as a hypocrite. His failure to trust God placed him in the circumstances where he had to feign insanity. But God does not judge us by our past sins when we repent. He instead rewards those with the faith to serve Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God by hating evil</u>. In a pre-incarnate appearance, Jesus commended Abraham for fearing God (Gen 22:12). The Bible also celebrates Job for “fearing God.” (Job 1:1). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). Yet, fearing God does not mean that you fear that He will arbitrarily do something to you. It is instead defined as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:13). Are you tolerating evil by disobeying God or embracing evil worldly things?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing God brings His “hedge of protection”</u>. David stated that “<strong><sup>7<em> </em></sup></strong><em>The angel of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them</em>.” (Ps. 34:7). “For He will give His angels orders concerning you, to protect you in all your ways.” (Ps. 91:11). God is your “shield” when you take refuge in Him: “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (2 Sam. 22:31). “He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5b). “David narrowly escaped death among the Philistines. He was still a hunted, wanted man with King Saul determined to kill him. A rag-tag group of desperate losers gathered to him at Adullam. David was at a genuine low point; yet he was still filled with praise and trust, even knowing that God had an angelic camp all around him. . . David’s protection was real, even if it was invisible. He could not see the angelic presence around him, but it was real. Many times in the Old Testament, the angel of the LORD was an actual material appearance of Yahweh Himself (as in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Judges+13&amp;t=NKJV">Judges 13</a>). We don’t know if David meant an angelic being sent by God, or God Himself present with the believer. Both are true.” (David Guzik on Ps. 34).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Because Job also feared God, Satan complained that God had placed a “hedge of protection” around him: “Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side?”’ (Job 1:10a). When you need protection from any type of attack, take refuge in God, and let Him be your “hedge of protection”.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus be your refuge in the wilderness</u>. It is in Jesus that we “have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.” (Heb. 6:18). “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). “Each will be like a refuge from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry country, like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.” (Is. 32:2). No one can replace the refuge that Jesus offers. Yet, He frequently uses His believers as the instruments of His refuge. If His love is in you, He wants you to be a refuge to those in need: ‘“naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’” (Matt. 25:36). Jesus asks us: “And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?” (Matt. 5:47). If you want Jesus’ help, are you willing to let Him use you to help provide for a person in need?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God, and He will provide</u>. If you fear God, He will also provide for you: “<em>for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything. . . but they who seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will not lack any good thing.</em>” (Ps. 34:9b-10). “For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and He has filled the hungry soul with what is good.” (Ps. 107:9). “The LORD is my shepherd, I will not be in need.” (Ps. 23:1). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). If you are in need, trust in God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God, and He will give you wisdom</u>. If you fear God, He will also give you the wisdom to know which paths to take: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all those who follow His commandments have a good understanding; His praise endures forever.” (Ps. 111:10). “And to mankind He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding.”’ (Job 28:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God, and He will also give you other types of blessings</u>. David also proclaimed that “<em>how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!</em>” (Ps. 34:8b). If you trust God and fear Him, you also will be blessed: “How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, . ..” (Ps. 40:4). “LORD of armies, blessed is the person who trusts in You!” (Ps. 84:12). “One who pays attention to the word will find good, and blessed is one who trusts in the LORD. “ (Prov. 16:20). “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD.” (Jer. 17:7). God’s grace is greater than we even can imagine.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="righteousness-when-you-are-attacked-pursue-gods-righteousness.-ps.-3412-14.">4. <u>Righteousness: When You Are Attacked, Pursue God’s Righteousness</u>. Ps. 34:12-14.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David urged believers to show their gratitude by pursuing God’s righteousness</u>. Based upon his mistakes, David encouraged others to try to follow after God’s righteousness: “<strong><sup>12<em> </em></sup></strong><em>Who is the person who desires life and loves length of days, that he may see good? <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it</em>.” (Ps. 34:12-14). “To teach men how to live and how to die, is the aim of all useful religious instruction. The rewards of virtue are the baits with which the young are to be drawn to morality. While we teach piety to God, we should also dwell much upon morality towards man.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 34).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Follow God’s righteousness by restraining your words</u>. Peter quoted from David’s Psalm 34:12-13 to also urge believers to follow after God’s righteousness: “For, ‘The one who desires life, to love and see good days, must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.”’ (1 Pet. 3:10). You cannot call yourself “religious” if you allow evil or deceit to come from your mouth: “If anyone thinks himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this person’s religion is worthless.” (Jam. 1:26). Thus, every believer should pray to God for the strength to restrain their lips: “Set a guard, LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.” (Ps. 141:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Follow God’s righteousness by seeking peace</u>. David also urged believers to “<em>do good; seek peace and pursue it</em>.” (Ps. 34:14b). Here, Peter again quotes from David: “He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.” (1 Pet. 3:11). “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.” (Ro. 12:18). “So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.” (Ro. 14:19). “ . . . God has called us in peace.” (1 Cor. 7:15b). “Pursue peace with all people, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.” (Heb. 12:14). When others quarrel with you or make you angry, do you try to bring peace and reconciliation?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prayer-when-you-are-attacked-pray-for-gods-deliverance.-ps.-3415--17.">5. <u>Prayer: When You Are Attacked, Pray For God’s Deliverance</u>. Ps. 34:15 -17.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David urged believers to pray to God when they needed deliverance</u>. Based his own experience, David also encouraged others to cry out for God’s help when they face trials: “<sup><strong>15</strong></sup> <em>The eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are toward the righteous, and His ears are toward their cry for help. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The face of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is against evildoers, to eliminate the memory of them from the earth</em>. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>The righteous cry out, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hears and rescues them from all their troubles.</em>” (Ps. 34:15-17). We can never be “righteous” on our own to allow our prayers to be heard. But we can give thanks that Jesus can make any believer “righteous.”</p></li>

<p>Seek God in prayer when you need deliverance<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Confess your sins before you seek God through prayer</u>. Peter again quoted from Psalm 34:15-16, when he said: “For eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against evildoers.” (1 Pet. 3:12). Jesus also stated: “We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if someone is God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him.” (John 9:31). Solomon also said: “The LORD is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” (Prov. 15:29). Today, unconfessed sin can “hinder” your prayers (1 Pet. 3:7). When you confess your sins to Jesus, He will forgive you (1 Jo. 1:9). Your prayers to God will then be unhindered.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are attacked, pray for guidance</u>. After you repent of your sins, you can then seek God’s answer to any dilemma that you face through prayer: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8). The Apostle Paul also urged believers to turn to God in prayer anytime they are in need of deliverance: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.” (Phil. 4:6). “With every prayer and request, pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be alert with all perseverance and every request for all the saints,” (Eph. 6:18). God also urges you to “pray without ceasing,” (1 Thess. 5:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you seek Him, the Holy Spirit will guide you</u>. David relied upon what seemed right in his heart in seeking refuge with his enemies. But believers are warned not to rely upon their own understanding. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). The heart is also deceitful. “He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks wisely will be delivered.” (Prov. 28:26). “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). After making this mistake, David later recorded in a psalm that he would turn to God’s Word to guide his path: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). The Holy Spirit will help you to remember the Word and apply it in your life. “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26, 16; 15:26; 16:13). Are you reading the Word and praying for the Spirit to guide you?</p></li>

<h2 id="humility-when-you-are-attacked-humble-yourself-before-god.-ps.-3418-20.">6. <u>Humility: When You Are Attacked, Humble Yourself Before God</u>. Ps. 34:18-20.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David encouraged believers with the promise that God hears the prayers of the humble</u>. Also based upon his own experience, David encouraged others that they could turn to God when they felt brokenhearted, defeated, or humbled through failure: “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit</em>. <strong><sup><em>19</em> </sup></strong><em>The afflictions of the righteous are many, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rescues him from them all. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He protects all his bones, not one of them is broken.</em>” (Ps. 34:18-20). When you feel defeated, God will lift you up. In your humility, you will find His grace. He will comfort and uplift you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you feel sad, know that God is with you<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God delivers the humble</u>. David’s humility when captured forced him to turn to God. This allowed God to deliver him. “Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,” (1 Pet. 5:6). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Ja. 4:10). “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). After Paul had sinned, God also humbled him before saving him: “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness. . . <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me, <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.” (2 Cor. 11:30, 32-33). When you need deliverance, humble yourself before God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God hears the prayers of the brokenhearted</u>. When you are authentic and humbly lay out your burdens to God, He will never reject them: “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, God, You will not despise.” (Ps. 51:17). “For this is what the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, says: ‘I dwell in a high and holy place, and also with the contrite and lowly of spirit in order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite.”’ (Is. 57:15). For example, God heard the prayers of King Josiah because he humbled himself when he prayed to God: ‘“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Regarding the words which you have heard, since your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become an object of horror and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me, I have indeed heard you,’ declares the LORD.”’ (2 Kgs. 22:18b-19). If you feel defeated, don’t worry about having the “right” prayer. Pour out your heart to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also heals the brokenhearted</u>. God will not only hear the prayers of the brokenhearted, He will heal the brokenhearted when they cry out to Him: “He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” (Ps. 147:3). If you are in emotional or physical pain because of any type of loss or trial, call out to God and let Him heal you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus fulfilled God’s promise to David regarding the blessing of submitting in humility</u>. As part of David’s exhortation to be humble, he promised that God will protect the humble: “<em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>He protects all his bones, not one of them is broken.</em>” (Ps. 34:20). Jesus humbled Himself to die for mankind: “And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death: death on a cross.” (Phil. 2:8). To fulfill the promise that God gave David for those who humble themselves before Him, Jesus did not suffer any broken bones: “For these things took place so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: ‘Not a bone of Him shall be broken.”’ (Jo. 19:36). He also fulfilled God’s Word that the Passover lamb would have no broken bones (Ex. 12:46). Every word in the Bible is true. You can also trust God to keep His promises to you.</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-when-you-are-attacked-have-faith-in-gods-deliverance.-ps.-3421-22.">7. <u>Faith: When You Are Attacked, Have Faith in God’s Deliverance</u>. Ps. 34:21-22.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David encouraged believers with the promise of God’s redemption of the faithful</u>. Finally, based upon his own deliverance, David encouraged others to have faith in God: “<em><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Evil will bring death to the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will suffer for their guilt.</em> <em><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> redeems the souls of His servants, and none of those who take refuge in Him will suffer for their guilt</em>.” (Ps. 34:21-22). Death eventually comes to every person. But Jesus has conquered death, and He offers to redeem your soul.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God offers the promise of redemption for those with faith in Jesus</u>. David frequently wrote about the hope that God had given him for eternal life: “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.” (Ps. 16:11). “Into Your hand I entrust my spirit; You have redeemed me, LORD, God of truth.” (Ps. 31:5). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, For He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle which is against me, for they are many who are aggressive toward me.” (Ps. 55:18). “My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You; and my soul, which You have redeemed.” (Ps. 71:23). “Who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with favor and compassion;” (Ps. 103:4). Through Jesus, you also have this hope.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through Jesus, you are freed from condemnation</u>. David promised that the righteous will not “<em>suffer for their guilt</em>.” (Ps. 34:22). Jesus fulfilled this promise: “Therefore there is now no condemnation at all for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Ro. 8:1). “[W]ho is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, but rather, was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.” (Ro. 8:34). David’s example also shows that we are saved by faith alone: “For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works, . . .” (Eph. 2:8-9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Like David, share your testimony with others</u>. Some believe that evangelism only exists in the New Testament. But this psalm was David’s attempt to show God’s love for him as a sinner in his darkest hour. David did not deserve to be saved. God instead delivered him out of grace because of David’s faith. Jesus calls upon every believer to follow David’s example and share the hope that He has given you. “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matt. 28:19-20). Are you sharing your testimony?</p></li>
