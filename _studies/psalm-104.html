<p><strong>Psalm 104: Lessons About Jesus From David’s Praise For the Creator</strong></p>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 104 praises God for His amazing creative power. Hebrews quotes from this psalm to establish Jesus’ supremacy as the Creator (Ps. 104:4; Heb. 1:7). The author is not listed. But the Greek Septuagint (circa 3rd Century B.C.) declares this to be a “A Psalm of David.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Other ancient texts also attribute this psalm to David.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The Hebrew Masoretic texts do expressly identify the author. But this psalm begins with the Hebrew words “ברכי נפשי” (barachi nafshi: “Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul!”. In the prior psalm, David used this same expression three times to state his praise for God: “Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul.” (Ps. 103:1-2, 22). Thus, David is the most likely author of this psalm.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Assuming David is the author, his praise prophetically points to several revelations about Jesus as our divine Creator. Jesus’ creation reveals His: (1) holiness, (2) omnipotence, (3) love, (4) provision, (5) order, (6) sovereignty, and (7) glory.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in reference to His holiness, David praised God for being “<em>clothed with splendor and majesty</em>.” Because Jesus is holy, everything He created is good. <u>Second</u>, David praised God’s power in stretching the heavens to create our universe. David and other Old Testament writers revealed truths about God’s creation of the universe that would not be proven until centuries later. Jesus’ ability to stretch or expand the universe shows His omnipotent power. With faith, there is no problem in your life that is beyond His power of divine deliverance. <u>Third</u>, David praised God for creating a life-habitable atmosphere and dry lands. Because Jesus loves us, He used His omnipotent power to create the perfect, life-habitable Earth. <u>Fourth</u>, David praised God for providing for all creation. Because Jesus is faithful and loving, you can also trust Him to provide for you. <u>Fifth</u>, David praised God for the divine order in His creation. Jesus is a God of order. His creation is divinely ordered to provide for His people. <u>Sixth</u>, David praised God as being sovereign over all creation. Jesus is in full control over all creation. You can trust that He uses His sovereign power for His greater good. <u>Finally</u>, David concluded by proclaiming that all would one day submit to God’s glory, and fully praise and worship Him. Today, God’s glory can be seen in all His Creation. He is also worthy of your praise and worship.</p>
<h2 id="holiness-because-jesus-is-holy-everything-he-created-is-good.-ps.-1041."><strong>1. <u>Holiness: Because Jesus is Holy, Everything He Created is Good</u>. Ps. 104:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is clothed in holy righteousness</u>.  David praised God with all his soul for God’s majestic beauty and holiness: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul! <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, You are very great; You are clothed with splendor and majesty,</em>” (Ps. 104:1). This foreshadowed Jesus. He is clothed in the light of holy righteousness: “And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.” (Matt. 17:2). “In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.” (Rev. 1:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Bless God’s holy name</u>. In Psalm 103, David declared three times: “<em>Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul</em>.” (Ps. 103:1-2, 22). Other psalms contain similar praises: “For our heart rejoices in Him, because we trust in His holy name.” (Ps. 33:21). “Boast in His holy name; may the heart of those who seek the LORD be joyful.” (Ps. 105:3). “Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, my soul!” (Ps. 146:1). Moses also proclaimed God’s holy name: “For I proclaim the name of the LORD; ascribe greatness to our God!” (Dt. 32:3). God deserves your complete praise for His holy character and His amazing creation.</p>

<p>Jesus our righteous Creator is clothed in holy glory<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus is holy, He created a good and holy creation</u>. The Bible proclaims that all creation was made through Jesus: “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.” (Col. 1:16-17). Because Jesus is holy, the Bible declares six times that His creation was “good” (Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25). After creating mankind, the Bible declares that God’s creation was “very good” (Gen. 1:31). It was only because of original sin that creation was corrupted (Gen. 3:17-18; Ro. 8:22). But Jesus will come to restore His creation and make it holy again (Rev. 5:6-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Honor your Creator by seeking to live a holy life</u>. David promised to praise his Creator by being a blessing to Him (Ps. 104:1). You also can be a blessing to Jesus by seeking to lead a holy life for Him: “but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>because it is written: ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.”’ (1 Pet. 1:15-17; Lev. 11:44-45). This includes being a “living sacrifice” for Him (Ro. 12:1).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s mighty power can clearly be seen through His creation of the universe</u>. God’s righteousness can be seen through His power in creating of the universe: “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>covering Yourself with light as with a cloak, stretching out heaven like a tent curtain</em>.” (Ps. 104:2). Although this might seem like mere poetry, it was an amazing proof of God’s creation.</p>
<p><img src="/psalm-104/media/image2.jpeg" style="width:5.98333in;height:3.97143in" alt="He covers himself with light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain ..." /></p>
<p>God’s ability to stretch out the universe shows His omnipotent power<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Bible was the first book to describe our expanding universe</u>.  The Bible proclaims that God created the universe in two steps.  First, He spoke the universe into existence: “the Universe was formed at God’s command” for “He spoke and it came to be” (Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:9).  The rabbi Nahmanides observed that the universe began in size as a mere “grain of mustard.”<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>  Second, on 12 separate occasions, five different Old Testament writers revealed that God then “stretched out” the stars from a small starting point to their present locations: (1) “who alone <em>stretches out</em> the heavens” (Job 9:8); (2) “He <em>stretches out</em> the north over empty space and hangs the Earth on nothing” (Job 26:7); (3) “Oh Lord my God, though art very great; . . . <em>stretching out</em> Heaven (the stars and the Universe) like a tent curtain” (Ps. 104:1-2); (4) “[God] <em>stretches out</em> the Heavens (the stars and the Universe) like a curtain.  And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in” (Is. 40:22); (5) “Thus says God the Lord, who created the heavens and <em>stretched them out</em>. . .” (Is. 42:5); (6)  “. . . I, the Lord, am the maker of all things, <em>stretching out</em> the heavens by Myself and spreading out the Earth all alone” (Is. 44:24); (7) “It is I who made the Earth, and created man upon it I <em>stretched out</em> the heavens with My hands . . .” (Is. 45:12); (8)  “That you have forgotten the Lord your Maker, who <em>stretched out</em> the heavens and laid the foundations of the Earth. . .”  (Is. 51:13); (9) “It is He who made the Earth by His power . . . And by His understanding He has <em>stretched out</em> the heavens”  (Jer. 10:12); (10)  “Oh Lord God, Behold, You have made the heavens and the Earth by your great power and by Your <em>outstretched</em> arm!” (Jer. 32:17); (11)  “It is He who hath made the Earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding He <em>stretched out</em> the heavens” (Jer. 51:15); and (12)  “. . .Thus declares the Lord who <em>stretches out</em> the heavens, lays the foundation of the Earth . . .”  (Zech. 12:1).  Job, the first of these five authors, wrote about the stretching of the heavens before Moses wrote Genesis.  In the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, astronomers confirmed the claims of the Bible.  By studying the starlight, they discovered that the universe began as infinitely small spec of matter and then stretched apart like the surface of space.  Astronomer Hugh Ross observes that the analogy to a tent curtain also makes sense in the context of space: “And, like a tent, the physical reality of the universe is its surface.  (All space, time, matter and energy, is constrained to the surface of the universe).”<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>  A tent curtain also conveys a three dimensional structure meant to protect its inhabitants.  Ross points out that “Job’s description of continuous cosmic expansion ranks as one of the most far-reaching and dramatic biblical forecasts of later scientific discovery.  Job accurately – and uniquely – predicted a monumental scientific breakthrough some four thousand years in advance!”<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> How could Job, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, living centuries ago before telescopes and knowledge of modern physics, have made these claims?  Their writings establish that the Bible is God’s Word.  No other holy book can make similar claims.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s invisible hand is evidence of His love for you</u>.  When you look at the night sky, you can praise Jesus for creating a life-habitable universe for mankind to live in:  “For the music director.  A Psalm of David.  <em>The heavens tell of the glory of God; and their expanse declares the work of His hands</em>.”  (Ps. 19:1).  “For the music director; on the Gittith.  A Psalm of David.  LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, <em>You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens</em>!”  (Ps. 8:1).  Are you giving thanks that Jesus created the unimaginably vast universe to allow life to exist?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the Creator of the universe who uses His power to deliver you</u>.  God’s power over creation is proof that you can trust in His ability to deliver you:  “Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?”  (Dt. 4:34). “Why was there no man when I came?  When I called, why was there none to answer?  Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom?  Or have I no power to deliver?  Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.”  (Is. 50:2).  The psalmist worshiped God as the creator of all life:  “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 115:15).  “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 124:8).  “May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 134:3).  Do you have the faith to know that there is no problem that is too big or small in your life for God?</p></li>

<h2 id="love-jesus-creation-of-the-earth-shows-his-love-for-mankind.-ps.-1043-9."><strong>3. <u>Love: Jesus’ Creation of the Earth Shows His Love for Mankind</u>. Ps. 104:3-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God also created a life-habitable Earth for mankind</u>.  God’s righteousness and His love for mankind can be seen through His creation of Earth’s atmosphere and continents: “<strong><sup>3</sup></strong> <em>He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot; He walks on the wings of the wind; <strong><sup>4</sup></strong> He makes the winds His messengers, flaming fire His ministers</em>. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>He established the earth upon its foundations, so that it will not totter forever and ever. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You covered it with the deep sea as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They fled from Your rebuke, at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The mountains rose; the valleys sank down to the place which You established for them. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You set a boundary so that they will not pass over, so that they will not return to cover the earth</em>.” (Ps. 104:5-9). The author of Hebrews quoted from these verses and attributed them to Jesus (Ps. 104:4; Heb. 1:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God created gravity to allow the Earth to spin without impacting its inhabitants</u>. David proclaimed that “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>He established the earth upon its foundations, so that it will not totter forever and ever.</em>” (Ps. 104:5; Ps. 93:1; Eccl. 1:4-5). From the frame of reference of a person standing on the Earth, the Earth’s gravity will make it feel “immoveable” or stationary. A person will feel stationary even though the Earth is in fact spinning at 465 meters per second or 1,040 miles per hour while it hurls through space around the Sun at 30 kilometers per second or approximately 67,000 miles per hour.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>  This is a testament to God’s awesome power as the Creator of the universe.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God created a life-sustaining water cycle</u>.  Astronomers have come to realize that Earth’s atmosphere is unique within our solar system and likely rare in the vast universe. Many today might shrug at the sight of clouds. But David praised God for creating a cloud system with life-giving rain (Ps. 104:3-4). Job gave a similar praise for God: “He wraps up the waters in His clouds, and the cloud does not burst under them. He obscures the face of the full moon and spreads His cloud over it. He has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters at the boundary of light and darkness. The pillars of heaven tremble and are amazed at His rebuke.”  (Job 26:8-10).  Genesis also records that, “Then God said ‘Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.  And God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.  And God called the expanse Heaven.   And there was evening and there was morning, a second day” (Gen. 1:6-8).  Out of love, He created the perfect atmosphere so that mankind could live and breathe and share in the joy of His creation with Him. Thus, He is worthy of praise.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God for creating the cloud cycle to deliver life-giving rain</u>.  Without the clouds, rain would not exist, and crops could not grow.  In the Bible, rain is a symbol of blessing, life, and God’s Word  (Dt. 11:10-17; 32:1-3; 1 Ki. 18:41-46).  The lack of rain is a symbol of judgment  (1 Kgs. 8:33-43).  Hosea said that the Messiah would come like rain on Earth  (Hos. 6:3).  The Holy Spirit also later poured out like rain  (Acts 2:1-8; 14-21). Thus, you can also praise Jesus for sustaining all life on Earth with drinking water and water for food to grow:  “And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and <em>upholds all things by the word of His power</em>.”  (Heb. 1:3).</p>

<li><p><u>David’s description of God creating the dry continents out of the oceans also shows the Bible’s accuracy</u>. David described how the oceans originally covered the mountains: <em><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>You covered it with the deep sea as with a garment; the waters were standing above the mountains.</em>” (Ps. 104:6). He then described how God allowed dry land to emerge from the oceans: “<em><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They fled from Your rebuke, at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The mountains rose; the valleys sank down to the place which You established for them. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You set a boundary so that they will not pass over, so that they will not return to cover the earth</em>.” (Ps. 104:7-9). Moses also described a similar two-step process in God’s creation of the oceans and then the dry continents: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then God said, ‘Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear’; and it was so. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>And God called the dry land ‘earth,’ and the gathering of the waters He called ‘seas’; and God saw that it was good.” (Gen. 1:9-10). Scientists have confirmed that the Earth was first covered with oceans. Through volcanic activity and plate tectonics, the dry continents then emerged from the oceans.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, there would be no way for Moses and David to have described these events.</p>

<h2 id="provision-out-of-love-jesus-provides-for-all-his-creation.-ps.-10410-18."><strong>4. <u>Provision: Out of Love, Jesus Provides for All His Creation</u>. Ps. 104:10-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God provides for all His creation</u>. Because God provides food and water for the birds, animals, and plants, you also can trust Him to provide for your needs as well: “<strong><sup>10</sup></strong> <em>He sends forth springs in the valleys; they flow between the mountains; <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>They give drink to every animal of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The birds of the sky dwell beside them; they lift up their voices from among the branches. <strong><sup>13</sup></strong> He waters the mountains from His upper chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works. <strong><sup>14</sup></strong> He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the labor of mankind, so that they may produce food from the earth, <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>and wine, which makes a human heart cheerful, so that he makes his face gleam with oil, and food, which sustains a human heart. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The trees of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon which He planted, <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>where the birds build their nests, and the stork, whose home is the juniper trees. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The high mountains are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the rock hyrax</em>.” (Ps. 104:10-18). “Divine power is as truly and as worthily put forth in the feeding of beasts as in the nurturing of man; watch but a blade of grass with a devout eye and you may see God at work within it.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 104:14).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ water of life</u>.  The water symbolized both life and purity.  God provides life-giving water to all His creation (Ps. 104:10-14; Gen. 1:11, 29). “He will also provide grass in your field for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.” (Dt. 11:15). “Then He will give you rain for your seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread from the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful; on that day your livestock will graze in a wide pasture.” (Is. 30:23). Even in the wilderness, God provided life-giving water by transforming undrinkable water  (Ex. 15:25-27).  He also caused water to miraculously pour through a rock  (Ex. 17: 5-6; Nu. 20:11).  Jesus offered “streams of living water to flow from deep within.”  (Jo. 7:37-38).  He gives us eternal life.  He also cleanses us.  He also gave an example of this when he washed the disciples’ feet during the last supper.  Even though the disciples were saved, they still needed to be cleansed of the sins of the world  (Jo. 13:5-10).  At His death, He poured out both blood and living water  (Jo. 19:34; 1 Jo. 5:6).  You are justified by His blood, and His water sanctifies you  (Eph. 5:26).  Thus, “[l]et us draw near… having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.”  (Heb. 10:22).  God offered the Jews abundant life (Lev. 26:4; Joel 2:24; Prov. 3:10; Ps. 144:13).  David repeated when he stated that God “<em>makes a human heart cheerful</em>” (Ps. 104:15). Jesus also offers believers “abundant life” (Jo. 10:10).  His blessing comes when you store up treasures in heaven by giving to others (Lk. 12:33). This blessing can bring His joy, happiness, and love. </p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His abundant provision in your life</u>. Jesus’ provision in your life is a sign of His love for you and another reason for you to praise Him: “yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” (Acts 14:17). Failing to give thanks only causes Him grief (Jer. 5:24). Do you praise Jesus for His “abundant” provision? Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from Him (Jam. 1:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because He also loves you, you can also trust God to provide for your needs</u>.  David stated that God “<em>sustains a human heart.</em>” (Ps. 104:15). God provides for all of His creation:  “Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!”  (Lk. 12:24; Matt. 6:26; Job 38:41).  “Who gives food to all flesh, for His faithfulness is everlasting.” (Ps. 136:25). “It is He who gives an animal its food, and feeds young ravens that cry.” (Ps. 147:9). Thus, you can trust Jesus to also provide for your needs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="order-jesus-divinely-ordered-creation-to-provide-for-us.-ps.-10419-23."><strong>5. <u>Order: Jesus Divinely Ordered Creation to Provide for Us</u>. Ps. 104:19-23.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love for His people, God divinely ordered creation</u>. David praised God for creating the moon, the seasons, the sun, and divine order to allow mankind to thrive: “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>He made the moon for the seasons; the sun knows the place of its setting. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>You appoint darkness and it becomes night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl about. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>The young lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>When the sun rises they withdraw, and they lie down in their dens. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>A person goes out to his work and to his labor until evening</em>.” (Ps. 104:19-23). David in part meant to distinguish Yahweh from the pagan deities: “The heathen were so affected with the light and influence of the sun and moon, and their serviceableness to the earth, that they worshipped them as deities; and therefore the scripture takes all occasions to show that the gods they worshipped are the creatures and servants of the true God (v.19)” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 104:19).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> But he also wanted to stress the structure and order God created for life.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God set the laws of physics that are necessary to sustain all life</u>.  Paul also claims that Jesus holds everything together in His perfect order: “in Him all things hold together.” (Col. 1:16-17).  God further declares that He “fixed” the laws that control the heavens and the Earth, what we call physics today (Jer. 33:25).  He allows life to exist according to His perfect plan. “Yours is the day, Yours also is the night; You have prepared the light and the sun.” (Ps. 74:16). “The One forming light and creating darkness, causing well-being and creating disaster; I am the LORD who does all these things.” (Is. 45:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also orders the days, months, and seasons</u>. David also referenced the ordering of life that Moses described in Genesis: “Then God said, ‘Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and they shall serve as signs and for seasons, and for days and years;”’ (Gen. 1:14). “Yours is the day, Yours also is the night; You have prepared the light and the sun.” (Ps. 74:16). God created this order in nature to structure our lives and allow us to thrive: “The moon, as well as the sun, is appointed to divide time; to determine its progress; to indicate the return of festival occasions, or appointed times to be observed in any manner. It is, in fact, the foundation of the division of the year into "months," and consequently the indication of all that is to be observed in the ‘months’ of the year. But for this, there would be no natural divisions of time except those of day and night, and of the year.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 104:19).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> In the examples David provided, God ordered life to allow it to be fruitful and multiply.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s promises are just as certain as the cycles of day and night and the seasons</u>. God later pointed to the certainty of His ordering of creation to encourage His believers that His promises are just as certain and reliable: “This is what the LORD says: ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night do not occur at their proper time, then My covenant with David My servant may also be broken, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers.”’ (Jer. 33:20-21). Thus, you can trust God’s faithfulness.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God is in full control over all His creation</u>. David praised God’s wisdom because He uses His sovereign control over all creation for His greater good: “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your possessions. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong> There is the sea, great and broad, in which are swarms without number, animals both small and great. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>The ships move along there, and Leviathan, which You have formed to have fun in it. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>They all wait for You to give them their food in due season. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>You give to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, they are satisfied with good. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>You hide Your face, they are terrified; You take away their breath, they perish and return to their dust. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the ground</em>.” (Ps. 104:24-30). Everything God made reflects His divine wisdom: “The LORD founded the earth by wisdom, He established the heavens by understanding.” (Prov. 3:19). All of His creation was “very good” before mankind corrupted it: “And God saw all that He had made, and behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.” (Gen. 1:31). “For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;” (1 Tim. 4:4). God also has given us wisdom (Job 38:36).  God reveals His glory when you use your God-given wisdom to examine His hand in creation (Prov. 25:2).  He is again worthy of your praise.</p></li>
<li><p><u>All creation will one day praise the Creator</u>. David proclaimed God as the Creator of all life: “<em>In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your possessions. <strong><sup>25</sup></strong> There is the sea, great and broad, in which are swarms without number, animals both small and great.</em>” (Ps. 104:24-25). Moses also proclaimed God as the Creator of all life: “And God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.” (Gen. 1:21). All life will one day praise Him: “Heaven and earth shall praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them.” (Ps. 69:34). “Praise the LORD from the earth, sea monsters, and all the ocean depths;” (Ps. 148:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Bible reveals Leviathan to be our Accuser, the Dragon, or Satan</u>.  David also referred to God’s creation of “<em>Leviathan</em>” and His decision to give him a place on this Earth (Ps. 104:26). In Hebrew, the name Leviathan means “twisting one”.  It referenced a mythical sea serpent (Job 26:12-13; Ps. 89:8l 104:26; Is. 27:1; 51:9).  The name is also associated with the devil as either the cursed serpent or dragon (Gen. 3:14; Rev. 12:9; 20:2, 10). In a moment of weakness, Job once called upon people who imposed curses to curse the day of his birth the same way that people would curse Leviathan (Job 3:7-8).  Job had also praised God for piercing the “fleeing serpent” “Rahab”, which means in Hebrew the “proud one”:  “With His power He quieted the sea, and by His understanding <em>He shattered Rahab</em>.  By His breath the heavens are cleared; <em>His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent</em>.”  (Job 26:12-13).  Another psalmist also spoke of how God would crush the “heads” of Leviathan, which suggests the image of a hydra (Ps. 74:13-14). Isaiah also revealed God’s defeat of the “dragon”, the serpent Leviathan during the end times:  “<em>On that day the LORD will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent</em>, with His fierce and great and mighty sword, <em>even Leviathan the twisted serpent; and He will kill the dragon who lives in the sea</em>.”  (Is. 27:1). Isaiah also referred to Satan as “Rahab”, the dragon: “Awake, awake, put on strength, o arm of the LORD; awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago.  <em>Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces,</em> <em>who pierced the dragon</em>?”  (Is. 51:9). Satan is also first referred to in the Bible as the “cunning” “serpent” (Gen. 3:1).  At the end of the Bible, he is referred to as the seven-headed “dragon,” whom Jesus has defeated: “And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, <em>a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns</em>, and upon his heads seven diadems. . . And <em>the great dragon was thrown down</em>, <em>the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan</em>, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.”  (Rev. 12:3, 9). In all these accounts, the Bible reveals the good news of his ultimate defeat. Satan squandered the opportunity that God gave him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is also sovereign over evil</u>. David observed that all, including Leviathan, “<em>wait for You to give them their food in due season.</em>” (Ps. 104:27). Job also praised God’s power to trample the sea’s waves (Job 9:12).  The sea often symbolized the wicked people: “But the wicked are like the tossing sea, for it cannot be quiet, and its waters toss up refuse and mud.  ‘There is no peace,’ says my God, ‘for the wicked.’”  (Is. 57:20-21).  When the sea disappears in heaven, it symbolizes the disappearance of evil people  (Rev. 21:1). This symbolism reinforces that God is sovereign over everything, including evil. Thus, you should never fear Satan when you are doing God’s will.</p></li>
<li><p><u>All created beings depend on God for their existence, including Satan</u>. David observed that all creation knows that God could crush them at any moment if He so willed it: “<em>You hide Your face, they are terrified; You take away their breath, they perish and return to their dust.</em>” (Ps. 104:29). “Everything depends on God’s care and provision. In fact, their very existence is by His power: . . . God is the source of all life; He created it, and He sustains it.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 104).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> His power also extends over Satan. One psalmist praised God because He “<em>crushed the heads of Leviathan;</em>” (Ps. 74:14). Job also praised God because He “<em>pierced the fleeing serpent</em>.”  (Job 26:13).  In the book of Revelation, Jesus is revealed to have defeated Satan, the serpent:  “And the great dragon was thrown down, <em>the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan</em>, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.”  (Rev. 12:9).  “And he laid hold of the dragon, <em>the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan</em>, and bound him for a thousand years;”  (Rev. 20:2; Is. 51:9; Ps. 89:8-10). Satan was once an anointed cherub on God’s holy mountain before his beauty caused him to desire to be lifted higher than God (Ezek. 28:13-17).  His beauty caused him to desire to be like God before God cast him out (Is. 14:12-15).  For his deceit, God cursed Satan. A future descendant of Adam and Eve - - the Messiah - - would ultimately crush him for his actions (Gen. 3:14-15).  To be connected to Adam and Eve’s seed, Jesus  was “born of a woman.”  (Gal. 4:4).  Through His death at the cross, He judged and defeated Satan. “The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.  The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.”  (Ro. 16:20).  Thus, you can praise Jesus for having defeated Satan.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for having conquered death and the devil</u>.  Satan desires to bring everyone down with him.  You can give thanks that Jesus not only defeated your enemy Satan but also death:  “The last enemy that will be abolished is death.”  (1 Cor. 15:26). Because of His death, you can enjoy eternal life with Him in heaven. “<em>You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the ground</em>.” (Ps. 104:30). “The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.” (Job 33:4). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). Thus, He deserves your praise and gratitude.</p></li>

<h2 id="glory-gods-glory-is-seen-in-creation-and-worthy-of-praise.-ps.-10431-35."><strong>7. <u>Glory: God’s Glory is Seen in Creation and Worthy of Praise</u>. Ps. 104:31-35.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s glory in creation is worthy of your praise</u>. David proclaimed that all will one day submit to God’s glory. As our example, David vowed to praise God for His creation: “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>May the glory of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> endure forever; may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rejoice in His works; <strong><sup>32</sup></strong> He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke. <strong><sup>33</sup></strong> I will sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>May my praise be pleasing to Him; as for me, I shall rejoice in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>May sinners be removed from the earth and may the wicked be no more. Bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 104:31-35). “<strong>I will sing to the LORD as long as I live</strong>: This remarkable psalm has little or no focus on God as redeemer and savior. Its focus is on the greatness and goodness of God as displayed in creation. Yet that was enough to make the psalmist determined to say <strong>I will sing to the LORD as long as I live</strong>. The God of all creation is worthy of our life-long praise . . . This again shows the importance of <em>knowing God as Creator</em>. The rejection of God as Creator has had deep and terrible effects upon the hearts and minds of the modern world. <strong>May my meditation be sweet to Him</strong>: The psalmist understood that God is also worshipped by our <em>thoughts</em>. What we choose to set our mind on is a measure of what we truly value. Knowing the greatness and goodness of God as revealed in creation, the psalmist wanted his thoughts to be pleasing to God.” (David Guzik on Ps. 104) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the King of Glory</u>.  God promised that the Messiah would come from David’s line (1 Chr. 17:11-12; 22:10; 2 Sam. 7:13; Jer. 33:17).  ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.’ Selah.”  (Ps. 89:4). “He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”  (Ps. 18:50).  Jesus was born into the line of David (Matt. 1:1).  He came to fulfill God’s covenant with David as the eternal King of Kings:  “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”  (Lk. 1:32-33).  “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.’”  (Rev. 19:16). Jesus, the King of Glory, rules in righteousness in heaven: “So I will establish his descendants forever and <em>his throne as the days of heaven</em>.” (Ps. 89:29).  </p>

<p>God’s glory is visible in His creation and worthy of your praise<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His majestic glory</u>. David worshiped God for His majesty, glory, and strength: “For the music director. A Psalm of David. <em>The heavens tell of the glory of God</em>; and their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). “One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek:  That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, <em>to behold the beauty of the LORD and to meditate in His temple</em>.” (Ps. 27:4). “A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, sons of the mighty, <em>ascribe to the LORD glory and strength</em>. . . “The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare; and in His temple everything says, “<em>Glory</em>!”  (Ps. 29:1, 9). “Splendor and <em>majesty are before Him</em>, strength and joy are in His place. Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples, <em>ascribe to the LORD glory and strength</em>. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come before Him; . . .” (1 Chr. 16:27-29a). “Ascribe strength to God; <em>His majesty is over Israel</em>, and His strength is in the skies.” (Ps. 68:34). God is “<em>clothed with majesty;</em>” (Ps. 93:1). “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and <em>may the whole earth be filled with His glory</em>. Amen and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19). “The heavens declare His righteousness, and <em>all the peoples have seen His glory</em>.”  (Ps. 97:6). “however, as I live, <em>all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD</em>.” (Nu. 14:21). “ . . . <em>The whole earth is full of His glory</em>.”’ (Is. 6:3). “<em>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD</em>, as the waters cover the sea.” (Hab. 2:14). Jesus made it possible through His sacrifice on the cross to let you share in His glory in heaven. Thus, He is again worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s glory in His creation foreshadows the glory of His new creation</u>. “In the new heaven and the new earth the wicked will have no place (Rev 21:8; 27; 22:15). The righteous should indeed adore Yahweh with their souls, praising Him forever. John prophesied in Revelation of the day when the prayer of Ps. 104:35a will be answered. Placed as it is near the end of Book 4, Ps. 104’s meditation on God’s power and wisdom in creation naturally anticipates the new creation.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 104).<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
