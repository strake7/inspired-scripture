<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 8 is one of many that exist to praise God for His creation (E.g., Ps. 19, 29, 104). This psalm is also addressed entirely to God. Here, David reveals several attributes about God and His creation that make Him worthy of praise. This includes His: (1) omnipotence, (2) sovereignty, (3) omniscience, (4) love, (5) grace, (6) empowerment of mankind, and (7) glory.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, David praised God’s holy name for His majesty that can be seen in the heavens. You can also praise God for using His omnipotent power to create the perfect universe for mankind. <u>Second</u>, David also praised God for having power over evil and for His plan to deliver mankind. You can also praise God for using His power to conquer evil and deliver you. <u>Third</u>, David further praised God for setting every star in its place. You can also praise God using His all-knowing power to create the perfect life-sustaining universe. <u>Fourth</u>, David professed wonder that such an amazing Creator would concern Himself with sinful mankind. You can also praise God that He made all of creation out of His love for you. <u>Fifth</u>, David praised God for mankind’s undeserved honors. You too should praise God for His grace and for blessing you with undeserved honors. <u>Sixth</u>, David further praised God that His grace included giving mankind dominion over all creation. You should also praise God for giving you the responsibility to be a steward over His creation. <u>Finally</u>, David praised God’s holy name for His majesty throughout all creation. You should also praise God any time you look at His creation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His glory in His creation</u>. David praised God’s “name” and His “splendor” that could be seen any time he looked up at the infinite stars in the sky: “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span> Glory and Mankind’s Dignity. For the music director; on the Gittith. A Psalm of David. <sup>1</sup> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth, You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!</em>” (Ps. 8:1). This psalm was unlike any before it: “For the first time in the Book of Psalms the personal feeling is consciously lost sight of in a larger, a national, or possibly human feeling. The poet recognizes God’s relation to the whole of mankind as to the whole material creation.” (Ellicott’s commentary on Ps. 8).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> God also wants you to appreciate all that He created for you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give glory to God for His amazing creation</u>. This was the first of many psalms that David wrote in praise of God as the Creator and the beauty of His creation: “For the music director. A Psalm of David. The heavens tell of the glory of God; and their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). “Be exalted above the heavens, God; may Your glory be above all the earth . . . Be exalted above the heavens, God; may Your glory be above all the earth.” (Ps. 57:5, 11). “Be exalted above the heavens, God, and may Your glory be above all the earth.” (Ps. 108:5). “The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.” (Ps. 113:4). Sadly, many today fail to acknowledge God’s miracles when they look at the beauty of the created universe.</p></li>

<li><p><u>The Bible accurately describes how God created the universe</u>. Some think that the Bible and science are irreconcilable. Yet, the Bible correctly proclaims that God created the universe in two steps. First, He spoke the universe into existence: “the Universe was formed at God’s command” for “He spoke and it came to be” (Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:9). The rabbi Nahmanides observed that the universe began in size as a mere “grain of mustard.” (Nahmanides, <em>Commentary on the Torah,</em> Genesis 1:1, <em>quoted by</em>, Dr. Gerald Schroeder, <em>Genesis And The Big Bang: The Discovery Between Harmony And The Bible</em> (Bantam Books 1990), pp. 64-65.) Second, on 12 separate occasions, five different Old Testament writers revealed that God then “stretched out” the stars from a small starting point to their present locations: (1) “who alone <em>stretches out</em> the heavens” (Job 9:8); (2) “He <em>stretches out</em> the north over empty space and hangs the Earth on nothing” (Job 26:7); (3) “Oh Lord my God, though art very great; . . . <em>stretching out</em> Heaven (the stars and the Universe) like a tent curtain” (Ps. 104:1-2); (4) “[God] <em>stretches out</em> the Heavens (the stars and the Universe) like a curtain. And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in” (Is. 40:22); (5) “Thus says God the Lord, who created the heavens and <em>stretched them out</em>. . .” (Is. 42:5); (6) “. . . I, the Lord, am the maker of all things, <em>stretching out</em> the heavens by Myself and spreading out the Earth all alone” (Is. 44:24); (7) “It is I who made the Earth, and created man upon it I <em>stretched out</em> the heavens with My hands . . .” (Is. 45:12); (8) “That you have forgotten the Lord your Maker, who <em>stretched out</em> the heavens and laid the foundations of the Earth. . .” (Is. 51:13); (9) “It is He who made the Earth by His power . . . And by His understanding He has <em>stretched out</em> the heavens” (Jer. 10:12); (10) “Oh Lord God, Behold, You have made the heavens and the Earth by your great power and by Your <em>outstretched</em> arm!” (Jer. 32:17); (11) “It is He who hath made the Earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom, and by His understanding He <em>stretched out</em> the heavens” (Jer. 51:15); and (12) “. . .Thus declares the Lord who <em>stretches out</em> the heavens, lays the foundation of the Earth . . .” (Zech. 12:1). Job, the first of these five authors, wrote about the stretching of the heavens before Moses wrote Genesis. In the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, astronomers confirmed the claims of the Bible. By studying the starlight, they discovered that the universe began as an infinitely small spec of matter and then stretched apart like the surface of space. Astronomer Hugh Ross observes that the analogy to a tent curtain also makes sense in the context of space: “And, like a tent, the physical reality of the universe is its surface. (All space, time, matter and energy, is constrained to the surface of the universe).” (Hugh Ross <em>A Matter of Days</em> (2<sup>nd</sup> ed. RTB Press 2015) p. 69-70). A tent curtain also conveys a three dimensional structure meant to protect its inhabitants. Ross points out that “Job’s description of continuous cosmic expansion ranks as one of the most far-reaching and dramatic biblical forecasts of later scientific discovery. Job accurately – and uniquely – predicted a monumental scientific breakthrough some four thousand years in advance!” (<u>Id</u>. at 56). How could Job, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah, living centuries ago before telescopes and knowledge of modern physics, have made these claims? Their writings establish that the Bible is God’s Word. No other holy book can make similar claims. Thus, He is worthy of your praise. Any time you look at the stars in the night sky, stop and praise Him.</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-god-for-using-his-power-to-conquer-evil-and-deliver-you.-ps.-82.">2. <u>Sovereignty: Praise God for Using His Power to Conquer Evil and Deliver You</u>. Ps. 8:2.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His sovereignty over evil</u>. David proclaimed that the humble know that God is sovereign over evil and therefore able to protect them: “<sup>2 </sup><em>From the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have established strength because of Your enemies, to do away with the enemy and the revengeful</em>.” (Ps. 8:2). Because God is powerful enough to create the universe, Satan is no rival to His indescribable power. But only those with a childlike faith can see God’s sovereignty over evil through His creation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will come to reclaim the creation that Satan corrupted</u>. This psalm not only connects back to God’s creation account in Genesis 1 and 2, it also speaks to God’s promise to redeem His fallen creation through a future child of mankind: “[David] understands his own place in the line of descent that starts with Adam (cf. 8:4-8 [MT 8:5-9]), and that in the promise of Gen 3:15 God answers Satan’s triumphant roar with a baby’s cry. Through the king from David’s line, who will be a new Adam, David knows that God will reestablish dominion over creation (8:6 [MT 8:7]).” (James M. Hamilton Jr., <em>Evangelical Bible Theology Commentary Psalms</em> (Vol. I: Psalms 1-72) (Lexham Academic 2021) p. 153). God promised David that his future heir would reign forever (2 Sam. 7:16; Ps. 89:34-37; Jer. 33:17). Jesus was born into David’s line (Matt. 1:1-17). And He will one day reclaim the title to the Earth: “And one of the elders said to me, ‘Stop weeping; behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to be able to open the scroll and its seven seals.’ And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, as if slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.” (Rev. 5:6-7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sovereignty over evil is only clear to the pure in faith</u>. Jesus demonstrated His divine power through His many miracles. But His accusers still charged Him with blasphemy. Jesus responded by quoting David’s psalm: “and they said to Him [Jesus], ‘Do You hear what these children are saying?’ And Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for Yourself?”’ (Matt. 21:16). Jesus’ point was that God uses the humble to rebuke the proud: “but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,” (1 Cor. 1:27). According to one commentator, Satan is left without a response when God uses the humble or meek to rebuke the proud: “Significantly, Jesus quoted this passage to His indignant accusers in Matthew 21:16, as Jesus did wonderful miracles in the temple area, and as He received the praise of children who cried out <em>Hosanna to the Son of David!</em> (Matthew 21:15). Because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy: The reason <em>why</em> God displays His strength in unlikely vessels is because it works to silence the enemy; Satan and his fellow adversaries have nothing to say when God works so mightily in an otherwise weak person. One dramatic example of this is the story of Job. In it, God silenced the accusations of Satan against both God and Job by the way that He sustained Job with His unseen hand in the mist of profound weakness. In quoting this passage in Matthew 21:15-16, Jesus told His accusers who <em>He</em> was and who <em>they</em> were. Since the babes and nursing infants praise God in Psalm 8, Jesus identified Himself as God. In this, Jesus also identified the indignant scribes and teachers as the enemy and avenger described in this Psalm.” (David Guzik on Ps. 8) (Italics in original).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus is sovereign, do not fear Satan</u>. In the oldest book in the Bible, Job praised God because He “<em>pierced the fleeing serpent</em>.” (Job 26:13). In the last book of the Bible, Jesus is revealed to have defeated Satan, the serpent: “And the great dragon was thrown down, <em>the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan</em>, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.” (Rev. 12:9). “And he laid hold of the dragon, <em>the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan</em>, and bound him for a thousand years;” (Rev. 20:2; Is. 51:9; Ps. 89:8-10). Satan was once an anointed cherub on God’s holy mountain before his beauty caused him to desire to be lifted higher than God (Ezek. 28:13-17). His beauty caused him to desire to be like God before God cast him out (Is. 14:12-15). For his deceit of mankind, God cursed Satan with a prophecy that a future descendant of Adam and Eve - - the Messiah - - would ultimately crush him for his actions (Gen. 3:14-15). To be connected to Adam and Eve’s seed, Jesus was “born of a woman.” (Gal. 4:4). Through His death at the cross, He judged and defeated Satan. “The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.” (Ro. 16:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for having conquered death and the devil</u>. The serpent Satan desires to bring everyone down with him. You can give thanks that Jesus not only defeated your enemy Satan but also death itself: “The last enemy that will be abolished is death.” (1 Cor. 15:26). Because of His death, you can enjoy eternal life with Him in heaven.</p></li>

<h2 id="omniscience-praise-god-for-creating-a-life-sustaining-universe-for-mankind.-ps.-83.">3. <u>Omniscience: Praise God for Creating a Life-Sustaining Universe for Mankind</u>. Ps. 8:3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His creating order in the universe</u>. David also praised God for setting the moon and the stars in place to allow for life to exist: “<sup>3 </sup><em>When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in place</em>;” (Ps. 8:3). This again speaks to Jesus. He sustains all things in the universe: “for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Col. 1:16). God further declares that He “fixed” the laws that control the heavens and the Earth, what we call the laws of physics today (Jer. 33:25).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love for mankind, God created perfect order in the universe</u>. The Bible makes clear that God created the sun and the stars to provide mankind sunlight during the day and starlight at night: “God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also.” (Gen. 1:16). Job praised God the Creator for creating the universe where gravity allows the Earth to “hang” on “nothing”: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>He stretches out the north over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing.” (Job 26:7). Because each star in the universe exists as part of God’s perfect order, He has named every single star: “He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.” (Ps. 147:4). “Raise your eyes on high and see who has created these stars, the One who brings out their multitude by number, He calls them all by name; because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, not one of them is missing.” (Is. 40:26). Thus, you can praise God that He created everything for mankind.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Modern science confirms the near impossibility of a randomly formed, habitable Earth</u>. Some believe that there is nothing special about our planet. Many assume that life-habitable planets must exist everywhere. But modern science shows that is not the case. In order for complex life to exist, it must be carbon-based. If not, it will rapidly break down.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> But this in turn limits the type of galaxy, solar system, and planet where life can even exist. Ross gives several examples to show why most of the universe is not habitable for advanced carbon-based life.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <u>The right kind of galaxy</u>. First, any carbon-based life can only exist in the right type of galaxy -- a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way. Elliptical and irregular galaxies contain active nuclei that spew out life-destroying radiation. An estimated five percent of the galaxies within the universe are spiral like ours. According to Ross, the remaining 95 percent of all other galaxies could not, under any circumstances, support advanced life.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>(2) <u>The right location in a spiral galaxy</u>. In addition to being within the right type of galaxy, life can only exist in the right part of a galaxy. Even in a spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, life cannot exist in locations where the stars are densely packed together.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In contrast, in a location far away from other stars, in an elliptical galaxy, life-essential heavy elements are too thinly distributed for advanced life to exist.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Our solar system is in a limited habitable zone of the Milky Way, neither too far or too close from other densely packed solar systems within the galaxy.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Life in the center of our Milky Way Galaxy also could not exist. The close proximity of the surrounding stars from intense competing gravity would destroy the regular orbit of any planet around any given star.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>(3) <u>The right solar system within the right galaxy</u>. In addition to requiring the right kind of galaxy and the right location within a galaxy, advanced life requires a single star system. In systems with more than one sun, planetary rotation becomes erratic. With erratic orbits, life destroying climatic changes occur. Ross observes that <em>only a fourth</em> of the stars within our galaxy meet this criteria of being bachelor stars.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>(4) <u>The right size sun</u>. In addition to requiring the right kind of galaxy and the right kind of solar system, life requires the right size sun. Ross notes that a star larger than our own would burn too quickly and too erratically for life on a surrounding planet to be sustained.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In contrast, if a star is any less massive, the planet must be closer to the star to maintain a temperature suitable for life chemistry. However, when a planet is drawn too close to a star, its rotation period slows from hours to months. This is the case for both Mercury and Venus. With slow rotation periods, life again becomes impossible. Extreme climatic changes eliminate the possibility of advanced life on such planets.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>(5) <u>The planet’s distance from a sun</u>. The Earth is also perfectly positioned for the existence of life. A change in the distance from the Sun by as little as <em>2 percent</em> would rid the entire planet of all of its advanced life.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> If we were just slightly closer to the Sun, the “increased solar heat would prevent water vapor from condensing.”<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>(6) <u>The right planetary companions</u>. Without a Jupiter-sized planet positioned just where it is, Earth would be struck <em>about a thousand times more frequently</em> than it is already by comets and comet debris.<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Without Jupiter, life-destroying impacts would be common.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>(7) <u>The right magnetic field</u>. A planet’s magnetic field, a product of the exact heavy metal content in the planet’s inner core, also has to be perfectly balanced to sustain any advanced life. If the Earth’s magnetic field were stronger, advanced life would be killed through electromagnetic storms. Without a magnetic field, an atmosphere and liquid water would disappear. This is exactly when the oceans on Mars disappeared. Speaking of the devastating effects of a magnetic field any weaker, another astronomer observes: “This magnetic field does more than merely allow us to set a compass. Its force diverts much more of the potentially lethal cosmic radiation that reaches the vicinity of Earth. We live under a literal magnetic umbrella. Were this cosmic radiation not deflected, it would bathe the surface of the Earth with a continual shower of life-devastating ionization.”<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Ross provides dozens of other criteria necessary to find a planet capable of supporting carbon-based life.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> The maximum possible number of planets in the universe is estimated to be ten billion trillion. (10<sup>22</sup>) Even with that large of a number, Ross concludes after assigning a variable to each factor that the chance of meeting all of the necessary conditions for a planet to support life is statistically impossible: “[R]esearch finds less than 1 chance in a hundred thousand trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion [=10<sup>-99</sup>] that even one life-supporting planet would occur anywhere in the universe.”<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Even secular astronomers concede that humans will likely never find another Earth-like planet, capable of sustaining advanced life.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> The Bible justifiably proclaims, “the heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.” (Ps. 19:1). God is therefore worthy of your gratitude, praise, and worship.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s invisible hand is evidence of His love for you</u>. When you look at the night sky, you can praise Jesus for creating a life-habitable universe for mankind to live in “For the music director; on the Gittith. A Psalm of David. LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!” (Ps. 8:1). Are you giving thanks that Jesus created the universe to allow life to exist?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the Creator of the universe who uses His power to deliver you</u>. God’s power over creation is proof that you can trust in His ability to deliver you: “Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?” (Dt. 4:34). “Why was there no man when I came? When I called, why was there none to answer? Is My hand so short that it cannot ransom? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink for lack of water and die of thirst.” (Is. 50:2). The psalmist worshiped God as the creator of all life: “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.” (Ps. 115:15). “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 124:8). “May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 134:3). Do you have the faith to know that there is no problem that is too big or small in your life for God?</p></li>

Because of mankind’s sinful nature, David professed astonishment that God would do so much for mankind’s benefit: “<em><sup>4 </sup>What is man that You think of him, and a son of man that You are concerned about him?</em>” (Ps. 8:4). God’s unfathomable love for mankind was the answer to David’s question. While even some of the greatest people of faith have at time questioned whether God loves them, David reminds us that God’s amazing creation is proof of His love: “In comparison with the lofty heavens, the radiant moon, and the hosts of sparkling stars, man seems to the psalmist wholly unworthy of God’s attention. He is not, like Job, impatient of God’s constant observation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17-20</a>), but simply filled with wonder at his marvelous condescension (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 8).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>God’s love for mankind is beyond our ability to fully understand</u>. Traveling at 186,000 miles a second, it would take light an estimated 100,000 years to cross our Milky Way galaxy. To cross the observable universe, light would need to travel an estimated 93 billion light-years. This is bigger than we can even imagine. As one commentator observes: “Planet Earth is a mere speck of dust traveling through the vast expanses of space. And we, its passengers, might well be viewed as less noticeable than the tiny, almost invisible insects that we unwittingly trample underfoot. But God is not like man. His power is so great that He sees us. He knows us. He cares for us. He seeks us. He meets our needs. Yes, this all-powerful God loves us. The Christian faith affirms that the God who created and sustains the universe is great enough to know you, the creature He has made. He is great enough to care about you personally. When I think how small and helpless we are in God’s expanse and awesome creation, I’m thankful that His love is as great as His power.” (Dave Branon, Richard DeHaan, <em>Together with God, A Devotional Reading for Every Day of the Year,</em> Discovery House, (2016), p. 15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God that He created the universe out of love for mankind</u>. The psalms are filled with similar claims of astonishment that God would concern Himself with sinners: “LORD, what is man, that You look after him? Or a son of man, that You think of him?” (Ps. 144:3). During his time of unexplainable suffering, Job questioned whether God does in fact love mankind: “What is man that You exalt him, and that You are concerned about him,” (Job 7:17). David and later the author of the book of Hebrews asked the same question to draw the opposite conclusion - - God does love mankind more than we can understand: “But someone has testified somewhere, saying, ‘What is man, that you think of him? Or a son of man, that you are concerned about Him?”’ (Heb. 2:6). The fact that He would send His only begotten son to die for us is proof of His love (Jo. 3:16). When you see beauty in nature, do you stop and praise God for His incredible creation?</p></li>

Because mankind is unworthy, David praised God that He would bestow mankind with honors: “<sup>5 </sup><em>Yet You have made him a little lower than God, and You crown him with glory and majesty!</em>” (Ps. 8:5). Mankind has done nothing to deserve these honors. It is instead a sign of God’s grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Mankind will one day be lifted to a place above the angels</u>. God has appointed angels to protect and guide mankind. Yet, through Jesus’ redemption, mankind will one day be empowered over the angels to judge them: “Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life?” (1 Cor. 6:3). At that time, we will also receive the crown of glory that God promised through David: “And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.” (1 Pet. 5:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God showers mankind with blessings out of grace</u>. The author of Hebrews quoted from David’s psalm to also praise God for mankind’s undeserved blessings: “You have made him for a little while lower than angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor;” (Heb. 2:7). “His glory is great through Your salvation, splendor and majesty You place upon him.” (Ps. 21:5). “Who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with favor and compassion;” (Ps. 103:4). “On that day the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them on that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.” (Zech. 12:8). God’s grace is one of the many reasons that He is worthy of your praise.</p></li>

<h2 id="empowerment-praise-god-for-giving-mankind-dominion-over-creation.-ps.-86-8.">6. <u>Empowerment: Praise God For Giving Mankind Dominion Over Creation</u>. Ps. 8:6-8.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for making mankind stewards of His creation</u>. As part of God’s grace and love, He has also made undeserving mankind stewards over all His creation: “<sup>6 </sup><em>You have him rule over the works of Your hands; You have put everything under his feet, <sup>7 </sup>all sheep and oxen, and also the animals of the field, <sup>8 </sup>the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</em>” (Ps. 8:6-8). Everything belongs to God: “A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD’S, and all it contains, the world, and those who live in it.” (Ps. 24:1). But God has empowered mankind to manage His creation. Mankind, however, has repeatedly failed as stewards of the environment.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God intended for mankind to manage His creation</u>. God placed the Earth and the animal kingdom under mankind’s care: “Then God said, ‘Let Us make mankind in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every crawling thing that crawls on the earth.”’ (Gen. 1:26; 1 Cor. 15:27). With this authority comes responsibility. Mankind must be good stewards over all of God’s living creatures.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will one day empower His believers to help Him manage a restored creation</u>. Immediately after Jesus reclaims full title to the Earth (Rev.5:1-9), He will proclaim a role for His believers in managing His restored creation: “You have made them into a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign upon the earth.” (Rev. 5:10). “The point that the book of Hebrews [Heb. 2:5-9] makes is that whatever dominion humans have over creation today is not what God had intended in creation. Through the incarnation of the Lord the plan of creation will be fulfilled, so Christians reading this psalm will offer greater praise to God for His amazing plan to prefect creation through the Son . . . The psalm is a reminder that we are on Earth with divinely ordained responsibilities.” (Allen Ross, <em>A Commentary of the Psalms: Volume 1 (1-41)</em>, Kregel Academic (2011) p. 298). Jesus’ grace is and again worthy of your praise.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Holy Spirit can also empower you for any task for God</u>. God’s empowerment is not limited to creation. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, He also seeks to empower you in any other area where you seek to serve Him: “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="glory-praise-god-for-his-glory-and-majesty-throughout-all-creation.-ps.-89.">7. <u>Glory: Praise God For His Glory and Majesty Throughout All Creation</u>. Ps. 8:9.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His holy name</u>. David concluded his psalm by repeating for emphasis his praise for God’s “name” and His “majesty: “<sup>9 </sup><em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!</em>” (Ps. 8:9). One of the most important purposes of the psalms is to teach you to make worship a regular part of your walk with God. If you fail to praise God for His creation, you are taking what He created for granted.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Bless God’s Holy name</u>. In the Bible, a person’s name is a sign of their character, not just a means of identification. Thus, on many occasions, David praised God’s holy name: “that Your name may be magnified forever,” (2 Sam. 7:26). “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19). “Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; bring an offering and come into His courts.” (Ps. 96:8). “Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.” (Ps. 115:1). Nehemiah also led the Jews in blessing God’s holy name: “bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God forever and ever! May Your glorious name be blessed and exalted above all blessing and praise!” (Neh. 9:5). Jesus also began the Lord’s prayer by declaring God’s name to be holy (Matt. 6:9) Do your prayers also include blessings and praises for God’s name?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the faithful Creator of the universe who is sovereign over everything</u>. The psalmist also worshiped God as the creator of all life: “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.” (Ps. 115:15). “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 124:8; 34:3; Neh. 9:6). As the Creator of the universe, there is no problem that is too big in your life for God to deal with.</p></li>
