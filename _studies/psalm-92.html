<h1 id="psalm-92-lessons-for-you-to-praise-and-worship-god-with-others"><strong>Psalm 92: Lessons for You to Praise and Worship God With Others</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, a psalmist praised God during a Sabbath. Today, any day can be a Sabbath: “One person values one day over another, another values every day the same. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind.” (Ro. 14:5; Col 2:16). But it would be a mistake to never observe a Sabbath. In addition to needing a day of rest, believers are urged to fellowship together in church (Heb. 10:25). When Jesus returns, believers will also gather every Sabbath to worship Him corporately: ‘“And it shall be from new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all mankind will come to bow down before Me,’ says the LORD.” (Is. 66:23). Thus, believers are still called upon to worship God together. Regardless of the day, you have many reasons to worship God with other believers. These include His: (1) loving faithfulness, (2) joy, (3) providence, (4) justice, (5) anointing, (6) spiritual growth, and (7) protection.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist declared that it is good to praise God’s love and faithfulness. God is also worthy of your praise and worship because He loves you, and He is faithful to keep His promises. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist gave thanks for the joy that God provides. God also deserves your praise and worship for the joy He provides you. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist praised God for His great works, most likely in reference to creation. God is also worthy of your praise and worship because He uses His sovereignty over all creation for His greater good. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that the wicked would perish like grass before God’s righteousness. God also deserves your praise and worship because He is just and fair with you. When evil afflicts you, you can leave vengeance to Him. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist gave thanks because God had strengthened him with the anointing of His oil, a symbol of the Spirit. God again deserved your praise because of the anointing and transformation that He offers you through the Spirit. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist declared that those rooted in God would prosper like well-watered psalm trees. God again deserves your praise and worship for the spiritual growth that He offers you. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist gave thanks because God was His rock, a symbol of Jesus. You can also praise God because He is your rock. During any trial or conflict, He offers you His protection and stability.</p>
<h2 id="loving-faithfulness-praise-god-for-his-loving-faithfulness.-ps.-921-3."><strong>1. <u>Loving Faithfulness: Praise God for His Loving Faithfulness</u>. Ps. 92:1-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Worship God to give thanks for His love and faithfulness</u>. The psalmist declared the privilege to worship God collectively for His loving faithfulness to His people: “<em>A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath day. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> It is good to give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and to sing praises to Your name, Most High; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>to declare Your goodness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night, <strong><sup>3</sup></strong> with the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, with resounding music on the lyre</em>.” (Ps. 92:1-3). “Proclaiming God’s <strong>lovingkindness</strong> (<em>hesed</em>, the great word for God’s loyal, covenant love) and <strong>faithfulness</strong> is another way to give thanks to the LORD. This declaration is not only to be made on the good days or nights, but <strong>every night</strong>. The first three verses of this psalm show that worshiping and honoring God have many different aspects and expressions. We should worship God in any available and honoring way. · It may be thanksgiving, singing, or declaration. · It may be because of who He is (<strong>the LORD</strong>, <strong>Most High</strong>) or because of what He has done (expressed in acts of <strong>lovingkindness</strong> and <strong>faithfulness</strong>). · It may be done at day or night. · It may be done with singing and with instrumental music.” (David Guzik on Ps. 92:1-3).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God for His lovingkindness and faithfulness</u>. The major translations focus on praising God for His love and faithfulness. In the NASB translation above, the psalmist praised God for His “<em>goodness</em>” and “<em>faithfulness</em>” (Ps. 92:2). In the NIV, God is praised for His “<em>love</em>” and “<em>faithfulness</em>.” In the NKV, He is praised for His “<em>lovingkindness</em>” and “<em>faithfulness</em>.” “The Talmud confirms this, saying that this psalm was sung on the morning of the Sabbath at the drink offering which followed the sacrifice of the first lamb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>) . . . “<strong>Lovingkindness . . . faithfulness.</strong>-- The two most prominent features in the display of the covenant relation of God towards His people. The connection of <em>lovingkindness</em> or <em>grace </em>with the morning, and <em>faithfulness</em> or <em>truth </em>with the evening, is only a result of the Hebrew poetic style; and yet there is a fitness in the association. Love breaks through the clouds of doubt as the morning light rises on the night; and thoughts of God’s unerring and impartial justice best suit the evening--the trial time of the day.” (Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Ps. 92).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ faithfulness</u>.  You can also thank Jesus that He is faithful to keep His promises:  “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His faithfulness to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments;”  (Dt. 7:9).  “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.”  (1 Thess. 5:24).  Among His many promises, Jesus is faithful to keep His promise to never forsake His people:  “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you.  He will not fail you or forsake you.”  (Dt. 31:6; 4:31; Heb. 13:5; Is. 43:25).  You can also give thanks that His faithfulness is not conditioned upon our faithfulness:  “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.”  (2 Tim. 2:13; Nu. 23:19).  Have you given thanks that Jesus will not use your sins to void any of His many promises to you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to God on a regular basis</u>. The psalms remind believers to make praise and worship a regular part of your walk with God, not just when you attend church: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, Sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.” (Ps. 7:17). “I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Be exalted, LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.” (Ps. “For the music director. A Song. A Psalm. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth; sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:1-2). “Sing to God, sing praises to His name; exalt Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the LORD, and be jubilant before Him.” (Ps. 68:4). “For the music director; on the Gittith  A Psalm of Asaph. Sing for joy to God our strength; shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.” (Ps. 81:1). “Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth; be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.” (Ps. 98:4). “Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.” (Ps. 135:3). Are you regularly praising God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship God, at a minimum, morning and night</u>. The psalmist declared that he would include worship “ <em>in the morning and . . . by night,</em>” (Ps. 92:2). Some psalms declare that the psalmist would worship in the morning: “But as for me, I will sing of Your strength; yes, I will joyfully sing of Your faithfulness in the morning, for You have been my refuge and a place of refuge on the day of my distress.” (Ps. 59:16). Other psalms declared that the psalmists would worship at night: “LORD, I remember Your name in the night, and keep Your Law.” (Ps. 119:55). God does not want worship that is forced or legalistic. But praise that only occurs rarely does not escape God’s notice.</p></li>

<p>Make it a habit to regularly praise God’s loving faithfulness<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="joy-praise-god-for-the-joy-he-provides-you-through-the-spirit.-ps.-924."><strong>2. <u>Joy: Praise God for the Joy He Provides You Through the Spirit</u>. Ps. 92:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God for the joy He provides</u>. The psalmist further declared that he would praise God for the joy that He provides His people: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>For You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, have made me joyful by what You have done, I will sing for joy over the works of Your hands</em>.” (Ps. 92:4). “It is difficult to say what ‘work’ is intended. Some have supposed ‘the work of creation,’ as the psalm is one ‘for the sabbath’ (see title); but perhaps the general ‘working’ of God's providence in the world is more probable.” (Pulpit Commentary on Psalm 92:4).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers you joy through the Spirit</u>.  Paul described the joy of heaven as something beyond what humans have seen or experienced (1 Cor. 2:9).  “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads.  They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”  (Is. 35:10; Is. 60:2).  But you don’t need to wait until you get to heaven to be filled with joy.  Jesus offers you an abundant life now:  “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.”  (Jo. 10:10).  The abundant life that He offers includes the peace and joy that only the Holy Spirit can provide:  “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, <em>joy</em>, <em>peace</em>, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Gal. 5:22).  “for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and <em>peace and joy</em> in the Holy Spirit.”  (Ro. 14:17).  “Now may the God of hope fill you with all <em>joy and peace</em> in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”  (Ro. 15:13).  “[I]n Your presence is fullness of <em>joy</em>;” (Ps. 16:11; 21:6).  Does your witness to others reflect the joy of the Holy Spirit?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is worthy of your praise because He is the source of lasting joy</u>. After Nehemiah led the Jews in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, the Jews worshiped together with God-given joy: “and on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy, and the women and children rejoiced as well, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.” (Neh. 12:43). After Jehoshaphat led the Jews in victory over three pagan invading nations, God also blessed them with His joy: “Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had helped them to rejoice over their enemies.” (2 Chr. 20:27). God makes His joy available to all believers. Again, He is worthy of your praise: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for <em>joy</em> forever! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “<em>I will rejoice and be jubilant in You</em>; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.”  (Ps. 9:2).  “But <em>rejoice</em>, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever!  And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.”  (Ps. 5:11).  “<em>My lips will shout for joy</em> when I sing praises to You; and my soul, which You have redeemed.” (Ps. 71:23).  Are you joyfully worshiping with others in church on a regular basis?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to God if your joy is missing</u>. You don’t need to feel condemned or that you are an inadequate believer if joy is missing in your life. Moses once pleaded for God to help His people find joy as they wandered in the wilderness (Ps. 90:15). On other occasions, the psalmists cried out for God to restore their lost joy: “Make the soul of Your servant joyful, for to You, Lord, I lift up my soul.” (Ps. 86:4). “Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.” (Ps. 51:12). If you are missing joy, cry out to God. “Shout for joy, you heavens! And rejoice, you earth! Break forth into joyful shouting, mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people and will have compassion on His afflicted.” (Is. 49:13). “As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.” (Is. 66:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God offers to give you joy if the desires of your heart are His desires</u>. If you find joy in the things of God, He will fulfill your heart’s desires: “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). “When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your comfort delights my soul.” (Ps. 94:19). If you feel that joy is missing in your life, pray for God to reveal if you are longing for the wrong things.</p></li>

<h2 id="providence-praise-god-for-using-his-sovereignty-for-good.-ps.-925-6."><strong>3. <u>Providence: Praise God For Using His Sovereignty For Good</u>. Ps. 92:5-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s plans for mankind are beyond our full understanding</u>. Because He created the wondrous and vast universe out of love for mankind, you can trust in His plans for you: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>How great are Your works, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Your thoughts are very deep. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>A stupid person has no knowledge, nor does a foolish person understand this</em>:” (Ps. 92:5-6).” “The meaning here is this: The psalmist, on the Sabbath, in giving himself to meditation on the works of God, is overwhelmed with a sense of their vastness, their incomprehensible nature, and the depth of wisdom evinced, far beyond the grasp of man, in what God had done. How soon is man lost; how soon does he get beyond his depth; how soon does he feel that here is greatness which he cannot comprehend, and wisdom which he cannot fathom, and goodness which he cannot appreciate, when he sits down to meditate on the works of God! . . . the plans or the purposes of God, as evinced in the works of creation and providence, are too profound for man to understand them. Who but God himself can comprehend them?” (Barnes Notes on the Bible, Ps. 92:5).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign and faithful to keep His promises</u>.  God created the universe (Gen. 1:1; Dt. 10:14; Neh. 9:6; Acts 4:24; Col. 1:16).  He later selected an insignificant, idol worshipper from Ur named Abram for His covenant (Gen. 11:31; 12:1; Josh. 24:2; Neh. 9:7).  He then renamed him Abraham (Gen. 17:5; Neh. 9:7).  And He made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to give them the Promised Land (Gen. 12:6-7; 13:14-15; 15:18; 17:8; 26:4; 28:13-15; 50:24; Ex. 12:25; 23:20-31; 33:1-3; Dt. 1:19-20; Neh. 9:8).  He also promised to destroy the pagan nations within it (Ex. 23:23).  Through Joshua, God later fulfilled these promises: “So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it.”  (Josh. 21:43).  As God once told Abraham: “Is there anything too difficult for the Lord?”  (Gen. 18:14).  Do you trust that God is in control and faithful to keep His Word?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the faithful Creator of the universe who is sovereign over everything</u>.  The psalmists worshiped God as the creator of all life:  “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.” (Ps. 115:15).  “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 124:8). “May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 134:3). There is no problem that is too big in your life for God to deal with. Thus, He is worthy of your praise and worship with others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is worthy of your trust and praise, even when His plans are unknown to you</u>. Because God is all powerful and all knowing, He wants you to trust Him. This is true even when you do not understand His actions: “This also comes from the LORD of armies, who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great.” (Is. 28:29). “Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the LORD, or who became His counselor?” (Ro. 11:33-34). Because He is motivated by love, you can trust that His plans are righteous and worthy of praise: “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot comprehend it.” (Ps. 139:6). At the end of his trials, Job confessed that he was wrong to question that which he could not fully understand: “Who is this who conceals advice without knowledge? Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.” (Job 42:3). Even when His reasons are unclear, you can trust that His plans serve a greater good: “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fail to acknowledge God are without excuse</u>. The heavens declare God’s glory: “For the music director. A Psalm of David. The heavens tell of the glory of God; And their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). But “<em>[a] stupid person has no knowledge, nor does a foolish person understand this</em>:” (Ps. 92:6). These persons are without excuse before God: “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse.” (Ro. 1:20).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="justice-praise-god-because-he-is-just-and-fair-with-you.-ps.-927-9."><strong>4. <u>Justice: Praise God Because He is Just and Fair With You</u>. Ps. 92:7-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will vanquish all evil in His perfect timing</u>. Although evil people can seem powerful and intimidating, they will quickly vanish before God like grass: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>When the wicked sprouted up like grass and all who did injustice flourished, it was only that they might be destroyed forevermore. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, are on high forever. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>For, behold, Your enemies, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for, behold, Your enemies will perish; all who do injustice will be scattered</em>.” (Ps. 92:7-9). “The psalmist saw many times when <strong>the wicked</strong> seemed to prosper. They grew quickly <strong>like grass</strong> and seemed to <strong>flourish</strong>. Yet he also knew that their prosperity was only the prelude to their destruction (<strong>it is that they may be destroyed forever</strong>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 92).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Thus, you can leave vengeance to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Evil will one day vanish before God</u>. Throughout the Bible, God promises one day evil will quickly disappear under God’s judgment: “<em>the wicked sprouted up like grass . . they might be destroyed forevermore.</em>” (Ps. 92:7). “The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; the people are indeed grass!” (Is. 40:7). “For they will wither quickly like the grass, and decay like the green plants . . . For evildoers will be eliminated, but those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land.” (Ps. 37:2, 9). “As for man, his days are like grass; like a flower of the field, so he flourishes.” (Ps. 103:15). “but the rich person is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich person, in the midst of his pursuits, will die out.” (Jam. 1:10-11). Thus, believers should be careful to avoid embracing the evil things of the world. They will one day vanish.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust is God’s justice</u>. Unlike the passing things of this world, “<em>You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, are on high forever.</em>” (Ps. 92:8). “Who is like the LORD our God, who is enthroned on high,” (Ps. 113:5). He is just and fair: “All my bones will say, ‘LORD, who is like You, who rescues the afflicted from one who is too strong for him, and the afflicted and the poor from one who robs him?”’ (Ps. 35:10). Thus, you can trust Him to deliver you from evil: “He saved me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.” (Ps. 18:17). Thus, you can leave vengeance to Him. “Vengeance is Mine, and retribution; in due time their foot will slip. For the day of their disaster is near, and the impending things are hurrying to them.” (Dt. 32:35; Lev. 19:18; Ro. 12:19).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anointing-praise-god-for-anointing-and-transforming-you.-ps.-9210-11."><strong>5. <u>Anointing: Praise God for Anointing and Transforming You</u>. Ps. 92:10-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God can empower you through the anointing of the Spirit and transform you</u>. In the face of his enemies, the psalmist gave thanks that God had anointed and empowered him: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>And my eye has looked at my enemies, my ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me</em>.” (Ps. 92:10-11). This praise for the oil of anointing foreshadowed the anointing of the Holy Spirit. “Grace is the anointing of the Spirit; when this is given to help in the time of need, and is received, as there is occasion, from the fulness that is in Christ Jesus, we are then anointed with fresh oil.” (Matthew Henry on Psalm 92).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God can anoint you with the power of the Holy Spirit</u>.  The psalmist declared: “. . . <em>I have been anointed with fresh oil</em>.”  (Ps. 92:10).  David also proclaimed that God “anointed my head with oil;”  (Ps. 23:5).  In the Old Testament, anointing oil symbolized the Holy Spirit (1 Sam. 16:13).  The psalmist declared “<em>You have exalted my horn</em>” (Ps. 92:10). In the Bible, horns symbolize power, strength, and refuge  (Dt. 33:17; Ps. 18:2; 75:4-5, 10; 89:17; 92:10; 1 Sam. 2:1; Lk. 1:69; Lam. 2:3; 1 Kgs. 1:50; 2:28). Together, this symbolized the power of the anointing of the Holy Spirit over evil (Ps. 92:11). “You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4). This is one of the many reasons to praise God.</p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus for the anointing of the Holy Spirit that He makes possible<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through the Spirit, Jesus offers you a fulfilling life in Him</u>.  After stating that God had “anointed my head with oil”, David added “My cup overflows.”  (Ps. 23:5).  Jesus does not offer a life that is free from moments of tragedy, sorrow, loss, or trials.  Nevertheless, Jesus offers you a fulfilling life:  “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.”  (Jo. 10:10).  “You have crowned the year with Your goodness, and Your paths drip with fatness.”  (Ps. 65:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through the Spirit, Jesus offers you freedom and transformation</u>. The power of the Spirit includes the power to break free of your sinful addictions and be transformed: “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <em>there is freedom</em>. But we all, with unveiled faces, looking as in a mirror at the glory of the Lord, are being <em>transformed</em> into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Cor. 3:17). “And do not be conformed to this world, but <em>be transformed</em> by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Ro. 12:2). These are additional reasons for you to praise God.</p></li>

<h2 id="spiritual-growth-praise-god-for-your-spiritual-growth.-ps.-9212-14."><strong>6. <u>Spiritual Growth: Praise God For Your Spiritual Growth</u>. Ps. 92:12-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you are rooted in Him, God can allow you to grow spiritually</u>. Even in the face of trials, the psalmist encouraged others that they could find peace and growth in God: “<strong><sup>12<em> </em></sup></strong><em>The righteous person will flourish like the palm tree, he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Planted in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, they will flourish in the courtyards of our God. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>They will still yield fruit in advanced age; they will be full of sap and very green</em>,” (Ps. 92:12-14). “When we see a noble palm standing erect, sending all its strength upward in one bold column, and growing amid the dearth and drought of the desert, we have a fine picture of the godly man, who in his uprightness aims alone at the glory of God; and, independent of outward circumstances, is made by divine grace to live and thrive where all things else perish.” (Charles Spurgeon on Psalm 92).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Bible is filled with promises of spiritual growth when you are rooted in God</u>.  The psalms are filled with promises of spiritual growth when God is your foundation:  “<em>The righteous person will flourish like the palm tree, he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon</em>.” (Ps. 92:12). Regarding the righteous, God promises: “He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither; and in whatever he does, he prospers.”  (Ps. 1:3). “But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the faithfulness of God forever and ever.”  (Ps. 52:8). “May the righteous flourish in his days, as well as an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.”  (Ps. 72:7).  Through Balaam, God also made a similar blessing for Israel when it walked in a Covenant relationship with Him:  “How pleasant are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel!  Like valleys that stretch out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.  Water will flow from his buckets, and his seed will be by many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.”  (Nu. 24:5-7). This promise is also repeated in the book of Isaiah:  “For this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and rocked back and forth on the knees.”’  (Is. 66:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Spiritual growth requires the constant study of God’s Word</u>.  God uses the analogy of a plant to convey the importance of a life-long study of His Word.  A plant that is deprived of water will wither.  So will any believer who is deprived of God’s Word.  Most well-water trees also produce fruit.  A well-watered believer also produces God’s fruit (Gal. 5:22-23).  But God’s fruit also comes in His timing. Are you regularly reading God’s Word to grow in your walk? If things progress slowly, will you trust in God’s timing?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the ultimate source of your spiritual growth</u>.  Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1,1, 14).  Thus, when you study the Word you are studying Him, and allowing Him to develop you:  “I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.”  (Jo. 15:5).  What do you do when you want to grow spiritually in Jesus but don’t see results?  “If we do find ourselves at a spiritual standstill, we must allow Jesus the ‘Sun of Righteousness’ (Malachi 4:2) to warm our hearts anew with His love.  We must send our roots deep into the Word of God by meditating on it day and night (Psalm 1:2).  Then we will be like a fruitful tree planted by rivers of living water, and our branches will extend outward in an ever-increasing influence and witness (v. 3).  They will be filled with blossoms that reflect the beauty of righteous living.”  (Dave Branon, Mart DeHann, <em>Together with God, A Devotional Reading for Every Day of the Year,</em> Discovery House, (2016), p. 1). </p></li>

<p>When you are connected to Jesus, the vine of life, you will grow in Him<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God for helping your grow spiritually</u>. God’s Word will also help to guide you to grow in your walk with God.  As you meditate on His Word and worship Him, the Holy Spirit can guide you and keep you on the right path.  “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”  (Ps. 119:105).  If you are lacking wisdom or facing the unknown, meditate on the Psalms and pray for the Holy Spirit to search your heart and give you the wisdom to guide your path.  “Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test and know my anxious thoughts; and see if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.”  (Ps. 139:23-24).  “Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.”  (Ps. 143:10).  “Make me know Your ways, LORD; teach me Your paths.  Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day.”  (Ps. 25:4-5).  “Establish my footsteps in Your word, and do not let any wrongdoing have power over me.”  (Ps. 119:133).</p></li>

<h2 id="protection-praise-god-for-his-protection-and-stability-for-you.-ps.-9215."><strong>7. <u>Protection: Praise God for His Protection and Stability For You</u>. Ps. 92:15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you take refuge in God, He is faithful to protect you</u>. Even though every person is sinner, God is still faithful to be a Rock of protection for those who take refuge in Him: “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>to declare that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is just; He is my rock, and there is no malice in Him</em>.” (Ps. 92:15). The Rock foreshadowed Jesus and the stability and refuge that He offers all.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the Rock of your salvation and worthy of your praise</u>. The psalms regularly praised God as their “Rock”. “For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God,” (Ps. 18:31). “He alone is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I will not be greatly shaken.” (Ps. 62:2). “He shall cry unto me, thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.” (Ps. 89:26). These proclamations all foreshadowed Jesus: “and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.” (1 Cor. 10:4). Because He is the Rock of your salvation, Jesus is worthy of your praise and worship with others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God because His ways as your rock are perfect</u>. God is also called the Rock because He offers a perfect foundation. “The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and just is He.” (Dt. 32:4). “What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? Far from it!” (Ro. 9:14). “For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.” (Ps. 5:4). He is again worthy of your praise and worship with others.</p></li>
