<p>Job 22: Seven Revelations About Jesus’ Holy Character that Respond to Eliphaz’s False Charges</p>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, Eliphaz made his final attacks against Job. Job’s friends had alleged that Job would not be suffering if he were not a wicked sinner. In response, Job pressed his friends to back up their claims by naming his purported sins. Without evidence, Eliphaz responded with false accusations of theft against Job. Eliphaz also made false claims that God is distant and wrathful. He advised Job that only his works in undoing his alleged evil acts could save him. Eliphaz completely misrepresented God. Through the revelation of the complete Word of God, the Bible reveals the fallacies in Eliphaz’s false claims. Jesus in fact offers all believers: (1) love, (2) truth, (3) hope, (4) forgiveness, (5) protection, (6) restoration, and (7) fellowship.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Eliphaz told Job that God is distant and unconcerned with his alleged righteousness because Job allegedly had nothing to offer God. Jesus in fact loves all people and actively watches you and intervenes for you so that you can serve Him. <u>Second</u>, with no evidence, Eliphaz falsely accused Job of stealing from those in need. Satan is the father of all lies, and Eliphaz acted on Satan’s behalf. In contrast, Jesus is the God of truth and justice when you are falsely attacked. <u>Third</u>, Eliphaz falsely told Job that he was trapped in his darkness and misery. Eliphaz again misrepresented God. Jesus is the source of hope and light when you face darkness. <u>Fourth</u>, Eliphaz then described God as wrathful. In fact, Jesus offers His mercy and forgiveness to all who believe and repent. <u>Fifth</u>, Eliphaz told Job that the alleged victims of his purported sins rejoiced in his demise. When you are falsely attacked, you can in fact turn to Jesus. He offers you His protection when you are falsely attacked. <u>Sixth</u>, Eliphaz also falsely told Job that God would only restore him when he earned God’s favor by returning money that he had allegedly stolen. In fact, Jesus offers His promise of restoration and peace through your faith, not your works. <u>Finally</u>, Eliphaz also falsely told Job that God would only restore fellowship with him after earning God’s favor. Jesus again offers His fellowship through faith, not works.</p>
<p>1. <u>Love: Jesus Loves All People and Actively Watches and Intervenes for You</u>. Job 22:1-3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz argued that God is remote and detached from human behavior</u>. Eliphaz alleged that Job’s claims of righteousness were useless to an allegedly distant God in heaven: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded, <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>‘Can a strong man be of use to God, or a wise one be useful to himself? <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous, or gain if you make your ways blameless</em>?’” Eliphaz implied that Job was being arrogant in crying out to God as if Job consumed a moment of God’s thoughts. “Eliphaz seemed so convinced of Job’s wickedness – even to the point of exaggeration (v. 5) – that he did not believe that he could be vindicated. So in Job’s blamelessness was hypothetical nonsense. For Job to be vindicated would be a lie; so how could God take pleasure in that?” (Frank Gaebelein, Elmer Smick, The Expositor’s Bible Commentary, Vol. 4, 1, 2 Kings, 1, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job (Zondervan Publishing House 1988) p. 953). Eliphaz also viewed God as remote. Many today also see God as a distant clock maker of the universe. Frequently, Satan’s most damaging lies are mixed with half-truths. Elihu would also later observe that God does not need anything from us: “If you are righteous, what do you give to Him, or what does He receive from your hand?” (Job 35:7). Paul would also later quote Elihu’s words (Ro. 11:35; Acts 17:24-25). But this did not mean that God does not care about us or our conduct. Nor does this establish that God is cold and distant. The complete Word of God shows how God has repeatedly intervened throughout history when believers cried out to Him. Before time even began, He also planned to provide the means for every person to find salvation through Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God made mankind in His image and watches over you</u>. Eliphaz’s attack also manipulated Job’s prior laments against him. In his bitterness, Job previously questioned why God would elevate mankind to even be concerned about him: “What is man that You exalt him, and that You are concerned about him,” (Job 7:17). Yet, the book of Hebrews quotes from Job to draw the opposite conclusion that God loves mankind and exalted it make it greater than the angels: “For He did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking. But someone has testified somewhere, saying, ‘What is man, that you think of him? Or a son of man, that you are concerned about him?”’ (Heb. 2:5-6). Thus, God does not have a low opinion of mankind. He created each person out of love so that each person could live in fellowship with Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus died on the cross so that everyone might find eternal life</u>. Out of love, God planned before time began to send Jesus to die on the cross to allow all who believe to have eternal life: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16). “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’” (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). As a further sign of God’s love, the Holy Spirit dwells within every believer to guide them and help you to be holy for Jesus (1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus advocates for believers daily</u>. Contrary to Eliphaz’s false charges, God also is not cold and disinterested. He even boasted twice to Satan about Job’s blameless conduct (Job 1:8; 2:3). Today, Jesus is your counselor (Is. 9:6) and your only mediator to God the Father (1 Tim. 2:5). He also advocates for you in the same heavenly court: “And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;” (1 Jo. 2:1b). “Christ Jesus . . . also intercedes for us.” (Ro. 8:34). “Therefore He is also able to save forever those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.” (Heb. 7:25). “This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.” (1 Jo. 5:14). Jesus is also looking to answer your prayers when you call out to Him: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8). Are you crying out to Jesus so that He may advocate for your needs?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God desires your holiness for His good works</u>. Speaking through Eliphaz, Satan asked what many question today: Why bother? God, however, prepared you before time began for good works: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10). Satan wants to make you compromised by sin so that you never live up to your higher calling.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <u>Truth: Jesus is a God of Truth and Justice When You Are Falsely Attacked</u>. Job 22:4-11.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that God punished Job for acts of alleged theft</u>. Job had demanded that his friends name his alleged sins. Eliphaz responded by inventing allegations of theft: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Is it because of your reverence that He punishes you, that He enters into judgment against you? <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Is your wickedness not abundant, and is there no end to your guilty deeds? <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For you have seized pledges from your brothers without cause, and stripped people naked. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>You have given the weary no water to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>But the earth belongs to the powerful man, and the one who is honorable dwells on it. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You have sent widows away empty, and the strength of orphans has been crushed</em>.” (Job 22:4-11). A worker’s wages were due by sundown (Ex. 22:26; Dt. 24:6, 17). Widows, orphans, and those in need were also entitled to aid (Dt. 10:12-11:32; 1 Kgs. 17:17-24). Job later denied violating these rules (Job 29:12-16; 31:13; 16-17, 21). Job’s friends were likely rich as well. Thus, it is likely that Eliphaz was projecting his own sins of theft onto Job. As one commentator observes, these charges were completely invented: “This begins a remarkable list of groundless accusations against Job. He accused Job mainly of greed and cruelty for the sake of riches. None of this was true but Eliphaz assumed it was because Job was once rich and was now beset by such tragedy. The only evidence he could offer was Job’s condition and he could not think of another possible explanation for Job's crisis.” (David Guzik on Job 22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you lie, you have come under Satan’s influence</u>. Satan is the father of all lies: “<em>You are of your father the devil</em>, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. <em>Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies</em>.” (Jo. 8:44). Thus, Eliphaz was acting under Satan’s influence. Slander is so offensive to God that it forms part of His Ninth Commandment (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). When you lie, gossip, or slander you also place yourself in communion with the devil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is the source of truth and justice</u>. Unlike Satan, “it is impossible for God to lie . . .” (Heb. 6:18). “God . . . cannot lie . . .” (Tit. 1:2). He is also the God of truth: “Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O LORD, God of truth.” (Ps. 31:5). Although mankind struggles with honesty and “white lies,” we can give thanks that God does not suffer any of these struggles: “God is not a man, that He should lie, . . ” (Nu. 23:19). God has shared His truth with us through His Word, which we can rely upon (Heb. 6:19). Jesus is the truth incarnate: “Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and <em>the truth</em>, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.” (Jo. 14:6). He is also the Word that became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). If you practice truth and speak no lies, you have come to the Light: “But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.” (Jo. 3:31). Yet, in God’s eyes, if you speak evil you “hate” the Light (Jo. 3:20; 1 Jo. 1:6). If you are the victim of lies, slander, or gossip, you can turn to Jesus to protect you from Satan’s attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><u>A godly person only speaks the truth</u>. You are to follow the light of truth that Jesus sets for you (Jo. 1:4). Jesus’ Word and His truth sanctify you: “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” (Jo. 17:17). If you follow His Light, you also become God’s child, and the Holy Spirit will speak the truth through you: “For He said, ‘Surely, they are My people, Sons who will not deal falsely.’ So He became their Savior.” (Is. 63:8). “A trustworthy witness will not lie . . .” (Prov. 14:5). “He does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend.” (Ps. 15:3). “You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.” (Lev. 19:11). “You shall not bear a false report; do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness.” (Ex. 23:1). “Therefore, <em>laying aside falsehood, speak truth</em> each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.” (Eph. 4:25). “<em>He who speaks truth tells what is right</em>, but a false witness, deceit.” (Prov. 2:17). “Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.” (Prov. 24:28). “These are the things which you should do: <em>speak the truth to one another</em>; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.” (Zech. 8:16). “The remnant of Israel will do no wrong and tell no lies, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths; for they will feed and lie down with no one to make them tremble.” (Zech. 3:13). If Jesus were to look upon a transcript of all your words, would He find that you speak only truths?</p></li>
<li><p><u>A believer who speaks truth from the heart abides with God</u>: Even when saved, if you want God’s Holy Spirit to be in your continuing presence, you must speak only the truth: “O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, <em>who may abide in Your tent</em>? Who may dwell on Your holy hill? He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, and <em>speaks truth in his heart</em>.” (Ps. 15:1-2; Prov. 10:31). In contrast, a liar abides in deceit: ‘“They bend their tongue like their bow; lies and not truth prevail in the land; . . . And they do not know Me,’ declares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. . .. ‘Let everyone be on guard against his neighbor, and do not trust any brother; . . . And every neighbor goes about as a slanderer. Everyone deceives his neighbor and does not speak the truth, they have taught their tongue to speak lies; . . . <em>Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit</em>; through deceit they refuse to know Me,’ declares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Jer. 9:3-6). Are you allowing the Holy Spirit to be in your presence with truthful words? Or, like Eliphaz are willing to use half-truths and lies?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <u>Hope: Jesus Can Be Your Hope and Light When You Face Darkness</u>. Job 22:10-11.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that Job had no hope of escaping his dread and darkness</u>. Instead of encouraging Job, Eliphaz alleged that Job was trapped in darkness of his own making: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Therefore traps surround you, and sudden dread terrifies you, <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you</em>.” (Job 22:10-11). Here, Eliphaz borrowed from one of Bildad’s charges against Job: “For he is thrown into the net by his own feet, and he steps on the webbing.” (Job 18:8). Eliphaz’s claims were again false. God declared Job to be blameless (Job 1:8; 2:3). His darkness was not because of some sin. Rather, his darkness was part of a test to refute Satan’s charge that even the most righteous members of mankind would only serve God for personal gain or blessings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers His light when you are in darkness</u>. When you feel trapped in darkness, you can turn to Jesus to be your light: “In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.” (Jo. 1:4). “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). ‘“While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.”’ (Jo. 9:5). “I have come as Light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness.” (Jo. 12:46). When you feel trapped in darkness, turn to Jesus as your light.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will also show you compassion when you suffer</u>. Jesus had compassion for the masses (Matt. 9:36). He also longs to show you His compassion: “Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, and therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.” (Is. 30:18a). “And He said, ‘I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.”’ (Ex. 33:19). When you feel alone or defeated, are you turning to Jesus to find compassion?</p></li>
<li><p><u>In dark times, place your hope in Jesus to cause all things to work together for His good</u>. God’s plans are frequently beyond our limited comprehension: “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Is. 55:9). Yet, even when you lack the ability to understand the reasons for a trial or why God allows evil to happen, God wants you to have faith that He has a greater plan of you: “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28). When evil seems to be everywhere, do you still trust that God has a greater plan for you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <u>Forgiveness: Jesus Offers His Mercy and Forgiveness to All Who Believe</u>. Job 22:12-18.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that God is wrathful</u>. Eliphaz then alleged that Job’s failure to repent of his alleged sins would only bring about further judgment from an allegedly wrathful God: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Is God not in the height of heaven? Look also at the highest stars, how high they are! <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>But you say, ‘What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness? <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; and He walks on the vault of heaven.’ <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Will you keep to the ancient path which wicked people have walked, <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were washed away by a river? <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>They said to God, ‘Go away from us!’ And ‘What can the Almighty do to them?’ <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Yet He filled their houses with good things; but the advice of the wicked is far from me</em>.” (Job 22:12-18). Here, Eliphaz began by borrowing from Zophar’s claim that Job could not possibly know the mind of God in heaven: “Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty? They are as high as the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?” (Job 11:7-8). Paul also adopted this as a true statement (Ro. 11:33). Yet, the fallacy was that both Eliphaz and Zophar implied that they in fact knew God’s thoughts. When Eliphaz purported to quote Job as saying <em>“‘What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness?”</em> (Job 22:13), he had misquoted Job. Job instead claimed that God seemed to punish both the wicked and the good, and implied that God was unfairly punishing him (Job 9:22; 10:3, 7-8; 21:23-26). Eliphaz effectively stated that Job had become spiritually blind to an allegedly wrathful God in heaven who destroys sinners with the power of a flood (Job 22:16). Eliphaz concluded by stating that Job would have a house filled with nice things if he were righteous (Job 22:18). God will in fact one day judge sinners and reward the righteous with blessings. But Eliphaz confused the ultimate with the immediate.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will allow floods and trials that you can survive with faith</u>. Eliphaz used the image of a flood to suggest an allegedly wrathful God (Job 22:16). In contrast, Jesus used the same image of a flood to state that everyone will encounter trials. Only those who cling to His Word in faith will endure their hardships and trials: “And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:26-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus does not want any to suffer judgment</u>. While Eliphaz portrayed God as both an inevitable and unavailable force of judgment, Jesus in fact does not want any to be judged: “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, <em>not willing for any to perish</em>, but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9). “Therefore the LORD will wait, that He may be gracious to you; and therefore He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for Him.” (Is. 30:18). Jesus further promises to forgive your sins if you confess them: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). He not only forgives sins, He will remember the sins no more: “I, I alone, am the one who wipes out your wrongdoings for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.” (Is. 43:25). When you sin, confess your sins before Jesus to be forgiven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Forgive others the way Jesus has forgiven you</u>. Job initially struggled with his misguided friends. Yet, he later forgave them. Jesus also warns that you must forgive others to be able to receive God the Father’s forgiveness: “For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.” (Matt. 6:14-15). “Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.” (Mk. 11:26). Thus, if you are looking for God’s forgiveness, don’t delay in forgiving others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <u>Protection: Jesus Offers His Protection When You are Falsely Attacked</u>. Job 22:19-20.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that Job’s innocent victims rejoiced in his downfall</u>. Eliphaz then added insult to injury by falsely claiming that Job’s alleged victims were celebrating his demise: “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>The righteous see and are glad, and the innocent mock them, saying, <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>‘Truly our enemies are eliminated, and fire has consumed their abundance</em>.’” (Job 22:19-20). Here, Eliphaz was twisting Job’s words that the righteous should be appalled at the suffering of a faithful servant like Job: “The upright will be appalled at this, and the innocent will stir himself up against the godless.” (Job 17:8). But there was no one celebrating Job’s demise besides Satan. Eliphaz’s statements were not only false, they were also cruel.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers to provide you with protection when you are unfairly attacked</u>. Eliphaz’s attacks were outrageous. In his time of sorrow, Job needed protection from such attacks. And God would protect Job from any further attacks from Eliphaz. This chapter would be the last words that Eliphaz ever uttered against Job. When you are under attack, Jesus will be your shield and protection if you take refuge in Him. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5). “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my savior, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2). “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (2 Sam. 22:31). When you are under attack, take refuge in Jesus’ Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is just and fair to right the wrongs against you</u>. Most will encounter people like Eliphaz, those who attack with cruel lies. Our flesh desires to strike back with insults when this happens. Yet, as hard as it is, you must learn to forgive and allow God to right any wrongs against you. God will one day bring justice to every wrong committed against you. “For the LORD is a God of justice; how blessed are all those who long for Him.” (Is. 30:18b). “Thus says the LORD, . . . I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 9:23-24). When you feel that you have been wronged, God wants you to trust that He will be just and fair with you. Forgive others and leave justice to Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <u>Restoration: Jesus Offers Restoration and Peace Through Faith, not Works</u>. Job 22:21-25.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that Job’s restoration depended upon restoration of his alleged victims</u>. Eliphaz then prescribed a works-based salvation that required Job to restore his victims: “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>Be reconciled with Him, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Please receive instruction from His mouth, and put His words in your heart. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored; if you remove injustice far from your tent, <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>And put your gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks, <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>then the Almighty will be your gold and abundant silver to you</em>.” (Job 22:21-25). Eliphaz repeated Bildad’s claim that repentance would bring God’s blessings (Job 8:5-6). God normally does seek to bless the faithful. But Eliphaz implied that a quid-pro-quo relationship existed between man and God. Eliphaz believed that if Job were to return to God and “<em>remove injustice far from your tent”</em> (Job 21:21) he would be guaranteed abundant wealth. This is similar to the modern “prosperity gospel.” It is also similar to many works-based theologies whereby mankind can allegedly earn God’s favor.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unless an exception applies, God normally does bless the faithful</u>. Satan’s most effective attacks again often distort the truth with half-lies. As a general rule, God does seek to bless the faithful: “The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:10). “The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, but He will reject the craving of the wicked.” (Prov. 10:3). “Fear the LORD, you His saints; for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything.” (Ps. 34:9). Jesus also directs believers to find their provision by seeking first the Kingdom of God: “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). But there are exceptions to every rule. The book of Job illustrates that God may sometimes withhold a blessing or allow the righteous to suffer as part of a greater plan (Ro. 8:28). Believers should not assume that God’s blessings are arbitrary and capricious. Yet, they should also not expect God to bless them. With true faith, you should simply be thankful for any blessing that you received as an undeserved gift (Jam. 1:17). Are you giving thanks for the blessings in your life as undeserved gifts?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s restoration and peace are frequently spiritual without being financial</u>. True faith can bring restoration, even when you have nothing. If you find delight in the things of God as opposed to money and worldly rewards, God promises to give you the desires of your heart: “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). If you find your delight in Jesus, you will find inner peace during even the worst of trials: “These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). Jesus was also clear that His peace is not the worldly peace, filled with excess wealth, that Eliphaz described: “Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). When you have His peace in times of trials you will confound the understanding of your worldly friends: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:7). Is your happiness tied to your wealth and status. If so, your peace is only temporary. It will likely disappear in the next crisis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <u>Fellowship: Jesus Also Offers His Fellowship Through Faith, not Works</u>. Job 22:26-30.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Eliphaz asserted that Job’s fellowship with God depended upon him breaking with evil</u>. Eliphaz also conditioned Job’s desired fellowship with God on a works-based salvation: “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>For then you will take pleasure in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; and you will pay your vows. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>You will also decide something, and it will be established for you; and light will shine on your ways. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>When they have brought you low, you will speak with confidence, and He will save the humble person. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>He will rescue one who is not innocent, and he will be rescued due to the cleanness of your hands</em>.” (Job 22:26-30). Here, Eliphaz repeated Zophar’s claim that God would hear Job’s prayers if he repented (Job 11:15). God’s light could again shine on Job if he only repented of his allegedly wicked ways: “Your life would be brighter than noonday; darkness would be like the morning. Then you would trust, because there is hope; and you would look around and rest securely.” (Job 11:17-18). But their claims were built upon a false premise. Job had not committed a serious sin. Thus, repenting of a non-existence, serious sin would not bring God’s fellowship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God does exalt the humble</u>. Eliphaz stated that God “<em>will save the humble person</em>.” (Job 22:29). As a general matter, God does exalt the humble: “A person’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:10). Yet, Eliphaz again confused the ultimate with the immediate. There are plenty of wicked people who enjoy temporary exaltation. There are also plenty of righteous people who bear temporary and undeserved shame. Jesus is the best example of this. God will ultimately exalt every humble believer. But for some this will only happen in heaven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith, Jesus offers you His fellowship</u>. You cannot earn God’s fellowship though your acts. What Jesus offers is a “free” gift that He offers through grace: “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:23). Your faith alone can bring you the blessing of Jesus’ fellowship: “God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). Yet, merely accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior is not enough to be in fellowship with Him. There are plenty of people who have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior but then make no effort to walk with Him. To maintain your fellowship, your faith must be accompanied by a willingness to accept Jesus’ invitation for a deeper relationship: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.” (Rev. 3:20). Are you accepting Jesus’ invitation to seek out real fellowship with Him?</p></li>
