<h1 id="kings-9-lessons-from-gods-judgments-on-ahabs-family">2 Kings 9:
Lessons from God’s Judgments on Ahab’s Family</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: 2 Kings 9 records the judgment of three members
of Ahab’s family. In this chapter, God used a general named Jehu to be
His instrument of judgment against Ahab’s son Jehoram / Joram (the King
of Northern Israel), Ahab’s son-in-law Ahaziah (the King of Judah), and
Ahab’s wife Jezebel. These three people were Baal worshipers who defied
God and led God’s people astray. From their judgment, God reveals seven
lessons about His judgments.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, God told Elijah that He would judge Ahab and his family
for bringing Baal worship to God’s people, for killing God’s prophets,
for their lack of faith and for their many other rebellions. Yet, God
delayed His judgment upon Ahab’s family to give them a chance to repent.
When Ahab repented, God initially withdrew His judgment upon him and
limited it to the family members who refused to repent. From God’s
delayed judgment, He reveals that He is slow to judge sinners and quick
to forgive those who repent. <u>Second</u>, through an unnamed prophet,
God warned that Ahab’s dynasty would perish like the evil dynasties of
Jeroboam and Baasha. The prophet also confirmed God’s prior prophecies
of judgment against Ahab’s extended family. These many prophecies
demonstrated that God had given Ahab’s family many opportunities to
repent. From this, God reveals that His warnings of judgment always
precede His actual judgment. <u>Third</u>, Jehu’s men were not followers
of God. They dismissed God’s prophet as a madman. Yet, upon hearing
God’s prophecy, they all committed to following after Jehu. From this,
God reveals that His Word is sharper than a two-edged sword. It can
convict, motivate, inspire and judge. <u>Fourth</u>, Ahab’s son Jehoram
/ Joram lived in paranoia. Thus, he sent two messengers to ask if Jehu’s
men approached him in peace. They instead defected to join Jehu. When
Jehu arrived, God confirmed that Jehoram / Joram would not live in
peace. Through these events, God reveals that those who live under His
judgment will find no peace. <u>Fifth</u>, Jehu confirmed God’s judgment
by instantly killing him. Ahab’s family, including Jehoram / Joram,
sowed the seeds of murder and rebellion. They would reap what they
sowed. Through these events, God reveals He will judge each person
according to their deeds. Only through Jesus can you escape the eternal
consequences of your actions. <u>Sixth</u>, Jehu also chased after
Ahaziah and killed him. Ahaziah was a descendant of Ahab and a Baal
worshiper. Thus, he shared the judgment that God gave to Ahab’s family.
From Ahaziah’s unsuccessful attempt to flee from Jehu’s judgment, God
reveals that His judgment cannot be escaped or avoided. Only by allowing
Jesus to take your judgment for you can you avoid judgment.
<u>Finally</u>, even when Jezebel knew that Jehu had come to fulfill a
prophecy of her judgment, she dressed up to show her believed
superiority and taunted Jehu. Her servants then tossed her from a
balcony, and dogs ate her remains to fulfill a prophecy of her ignoble
death. She is considered to be the most wicked woman recorded in the
Bible. She was responsible for seducing Ahab, his children and the Jews
with Baal worship. She lived a prideful and wicked life. From her final
judgment, God reveals that He will judge and abase those who live in
pride and rebellion against Him. These judgments should cause believers
to stop, repent of their sins and turn to Jesus. Each believer in Jesus
should further give thanks for taking these same judgments from
them.</p>

<u>God is Slow to Judge Sinners and Quick to Forgive Those Who
Repent</u>. 2 Kgs. 9:1-3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Elisha sends a prophet to anoint Jehu as God’s avenger</u>.
Because Ahab’s family would not repent for causing Northern Israel to
worship the Canaanite god Baal, God directed Elisha to fulfill
prophecies of judgment that He previously gave to Elijah:
“<sup>1</sup> <em>Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the
prophets and said to him, ‘Gird up your loins, and take this flask of
oil in your hand and go to Ramoth-gilead. <sup>2 </sup>When you arrive
there, search out Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go
in and bid him arise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner
room. <sup>3 </sup>Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head
and say, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘I have
anointed you king over Israel.’’ Then open the door and flee and do not
wait.</em>’” (2 Kgs. 9:1-3). By telling his servant to “gird up your
loins,” Elisha directed him to act quickly. The oil would be to anoint
God’s avenger against Ahab’s family. When a prophet used oil to anoint
someone, it was a direct sign that it was being done at God’s direction
(1 Sam. 10:1; 16:13). At the time, Jehu was in Ramoth-gilead, across the
Jordan River in the territory of Gad. Jehu was a general who had
recently recovered this territory from the Syrians. At the time, Jehu
was protecting it from another attack. Jehu’s father was named
Jehoshaphat. But, even though they shared the same name, Jehu’s father
was not the King of Judah. Outside of the Bible, a separate confirmation
exists regarding Jehu’s coup and rule through cuneiform inscriptions on
an obelisk devoted to King Shalmaneser III in Syria. Because Elisha was
famous, news of his visit would quickly spread if he had gone and met
privately with Jehu. Thus, he sent his servant to anoint Jehu. Although
we are not told the prophet’s name, many Jews believe that it was Jonah
(2 Kgs. 14:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jehu fulfilled God’s commission to judge the Baal worshipers
in Northern Israel</u>. In order to destroy Baal worship in Northern
Israel, God gave Elisha’s predecessor, Elijah, three commissions. First,
God told him to appoint Elisha as a prophet and train him to be his
successor (1 Kgs. 19:19). Second, God told him to anoint Hazael of Aram
in Syria (2 Kgs. 8:7-14). Third, God told him to anoint Jehu as the new
King of Northern Israel: “<sup>15 </sup>The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, ‘Go, return on your way to
the wilderness of Damascus, and when you have arrived, you shall anoint
Hazael king over Aram; <sup>16 </sup>and Jehu the son of Nimshi you
shall anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of
Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place. <sup>17 </sup>It
shall come about, the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu
shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu,
Elisha shall put to death.”’ (1 Kgs. 19:15-17). All three would slay the
worshippers of Baal. Hazael and Jehu used physical swords to kill. In
contrast, the sword of Elisha’s and Elisha was the Word of God (Heb.
4:12). Because God commissioned Jehu through Elijah, Elisha and Elisha’s
servant, Jehu was God’s avenger against Ahab’s family: “Now the
destruction of Ahaziah was from God, in that he went to Joram. For when
he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi,
<em>whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab</em>.” (2
Chron. 22:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is quick to forgive and slow to judge</u>. Elijah
immediately appointed his successor. But God delayed His judgment upon
Ahab’s family and then the Baal worshippers in Northern Israel. He did
this to give the Jews a chance to repent. When Ahab repented, God
withdrew His judgment upon him and limited it to the family members who
refused to repent: ‘“Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?
Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in
his days, but I will bring the evil upon his house in his son’s days.”’
(1 Kgs. 21:29). Even when God began to judge the Jews, He first limited
His judgment against Ahab’s unrepentant family. Only after the Jews
again refused to repent of their idolatry did He allow Hazael, the king
of Aram, to judge them. This shows that God is compassionate, slow to
judge and quick to forgive: “But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and
gracious, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness and truth.” (Ps.
88:15). “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The
LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and
abounding in lovingkindness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). God, however, does
not want you to misuse His mercy and grace as a license to sin (Ro.
6:1-2). He has shown every person mercy. You should respond to Him by
living as a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).</p></li>

<u>God’s Warnings of Judgment Always Precede His Actual Judgment</u>. 2
Kgs. 9:4-10.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Elisha’s servant anoints Jehu and commissions him to be God’s
avenger</u>. The unnamed prophet acted with faith-led obedience and the
risk of death to give Jehu God’s commission to carry out His
long-delayed judgment against Ahab’s remaining family:
“<sup>4 </sup><em>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to
Ramoth-gilead. <sup>5 </sup>When he came, behold, the captains of the
army were sitting, and he said, ‘I have a word for you, O captain.’ And
Jehu said, ‘For which one of us?’ And he said, ‘For you, O captain.’
<sup>6 </sup>He arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on
his head and said to him, ‘Thus says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘I have anointed you
king over the people of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, even
over Israel. <sup>7 </sup>You shall strike the house of Ahab your
master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the
blood of all the servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, at
the hand of Jezebel. <sup>8 </sup>For the whole house of Ahab shall
perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person both bond and
free in Israel. <sup>9 </sup>I will make the house of Ahab like the
house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son
of Ahijah. <sup>10 </sup>The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of
Jezreel, and none shall bury her.’’ Then he opened the door and
fled.</em>” (2 Kgs. 9:4-10). Jehu was God’s avenger (Ro. 13:4). At Mount
Horeb, God previously revealed to Elijah that: “It shall come about, the
one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and
the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.”
(1 Kgs. 19:17). Jehu would avenge the fact that Ahab’s family had
deceived all of Northern Israel into Baal worship. Ahab and Jezebel also
murdered God’s prophets (1 Kgs. 18:4), stole Naboth’s land and murdered
both Naboth and his family (1 Kgs. 21:1-16). Based upon the prophet’s
commission, Jehu later overthrew Joram, who is also called Jehoram in 2
Kgs. 3. Joram was the last king of the dynasty of Omri. Through Omri,
his son Ahab and his two grandchildren, the dynasty lasted 90 years.
Jehu’s rule was far shorter. He ruled over Northern Israel for only 28
years (841-813 B.C.) Although God had appointed him as His instrument of
justice, Jehu acted as a brutal despot after seizing power. He fulfilled
God’s judgment against Jezebel (2 Kgs. 9:33), Ahab’s 70 sons (2 Kgs.
10:1-11) and the Baal worshippers in Northern Israel (2 Kgs. 10:18-28).
Yet, he then slaughtered people that God had not condemned. Because of
his bloodthirst, the prophet Hosea later condemned him: “And the LORD
said to him, ‘Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will
punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an
end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.”’ (Hos. 1:4). Thus, Jehu
misused his God-given responsibility.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s judgment is always preceded by His warnings</u>. God
warned that Ahab’s dynasty would perish like the evil dynasties of
Jeroboam and Baasha (2 Kgs. 9:9). These leaders introduced idolatry into
Northern Israel with the worship of golden calves. They set up a
counterfeit priesthood, and they prevented the Jews from Northern Israel
from worshiping Yahweh at His Temple in Jerusalem. Each leader ignored
God’s warnings to repent. God judged Jeroboam’s household for this
unrepentant evil as a warning to future kings (1 Kgs. 15:27-30). Baasha
also ignored this warning and engaged in even worse acts of evil. As a
result, God judged his household as well (1 Kgs. 16:8-13). Ahab’s family
knew that God had judged these kings after their rebellions and refusal
to repent. Ahab’s family did not need or deserve further warnings. Yet,
God gave them multiple warnings through Elijah, Elisha and others. These
warnings also included miracles. Thus, God gave Ahab’s family multiple
warnings and chances to repent.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God specifically spelled out His exact judgment a generation
earlier</u>. The prophet’s words of judgment repeated Elijah’s prior
judgment upon Ahab’s entire household for the evil they had inflicted
upon all of Israel through Baal worship and Naboth’s murder:
“<sup>21 </sup>Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will utterly
sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and
free in Israel; <sup>22 </sup>and I will make your house like the house
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to
anger, and because you have made Israel sin. <sup>23 </sup>Of Jezebel
also has the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoken, saying, ‘The
dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.’ <sup>24 </sup>The one
belonging to Ahab, who dies in the city, the dogs will eat, and the one
who dies in the field the birds of heaven will eat.” (1 Kgs. 21:21-24).
In response to this judgment, only Ahab repented. Thus, God only spared
him from judgment, not his wife or sons (1 Kgs. 21:27-28). Because God’s
exact future judgment was spelled out a generation earlier, each person
had many chances to repent.</p></li>

<u>God’s Word of Judgment is Sharper Than a Two-Edged Sword</u>. 2 Kgs.
9:11-13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehu’s men proclaim Jehu as King of Northern Israel after
hearing God’s Word</u>. Jehu’s men were not followers of Yahweh or His
prophets. Yet, when they heard God’s prophecy, God transformed their
hearts to support Jehu as king: “<sup>11 </sup><em>Now Jehu came out to
the servants of his master, and one said to him, ‘Is all well? Why did
this mad fellow come to you?’ And he said to them, ‘You know very well
the man and his talk.’ <sup>12 </sup>They said, ‘It is a lie, tell us
now.’ And he said, ‘Thus and thus he said to me, ‘Thus says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘I have anointed you king over Israel.’’’
<sup>13 </sup>Then they hurried and each man took his garment and placed
it under him on the bare steps, and blew the trumpet, saying, ‘Jehu is
king!</em>’” (2 Kgs. 9:11-13). Jehu’s soldiers showed no love for
Yahweh. This was clear when they referred to Elisha’s servant as a “mad
fellow.” (2 Kgs. 9:11). Many in the world are equally filled with
contempt for those who proclaim God’s Word when it is used to correct or
discipline wayward behavior. Jehu was therefore at first careful to test
his men to see if they were loyal to the king. He likely assumed that
the oil on his head was an obvious sign that God’s prophet had anointed
him. But, after hearing God’s prophecy, the men immediately proclaimed
Jehu king. The blowing of a trumpet frequently accompanied a public
proclamation (11:14; 2 Sam. 15:10; 1 Kgs. 1:34). By laying down their
garments, they also proclaimed their loyalty (1 Kgs. 1:34). This
confirmed for Jehu that God would be with him and others would follow
him as king.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Word is sharper than a two-edged sword</u>. Although
they had no love of God, the Words of God’s prophecy transformed the
hearts of Jehu’s men. God’s Word can convict, motivate and inspire
because it is alive. It is more powerful than any weapon: “For the word
of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and
piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and
marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”
(Heb. 4:12). ‘“Is not My word like fire?’ declares the LORD, ‘and like a
hammer which shatters a rock?”’ (Jer. 23:29). “for the weapons of our
warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction
of fortresses.” (2 Cor. 10:4). When you try to motivate people to serve
and follow Jesus, use God’s Word in faith and pray for God to transform
their hearts.</p></li>

Kgs. 9:14-23.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehu works with his men to execute Jehoram (Joram)</u>. After
planning his coup, Jehu sealed his city to prevent word of his plans
from leaking out. He then marched toward a location where the king was
recovering from his wounds in battle. As he approached the king, the
king’s messengers all defected to join against Jehoram / Joram:
“<sup>14 </sup><em>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi
conspired against Joram. Now Joram with all Israel was defending
Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, <sup>15 </sup>but King Joram
had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds which the Arameans
had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. So Jehu
said, ‘If this is your mind, then let no one escape or leave the city to
go tell it in Jezreel.’ <sup>16 </sup>Then Jehu rode in a chariot and
went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there. Ahaziah king of Judah had
come down to see Joram. <sup>17 </sup>Now the watchman was standing on
the tower in Jezreel and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and
said, ‘I see a company.’ And Joram said, ‘Take a horseman and send him
to meet them and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’’ <sup>18 </sup>So a
horseman went to meet him and said, ‘Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’’
And Jehu said, ‘What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.’ And the
watchman reported, ‘The messenger came to them, but he did not return.’
<sup>19 </sup>Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and
said, ‘Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’’ And Jehu answered, ‘What have
you to do with peace? Turn behind me.’ <sup>20 </sup>The watchman
reported, ‘He came even to them, and he did not return; and the driving
is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives
furiously.</em> “<sup>21 </sup><em>Then Joram said, ‘Get ready.’ And
they made his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of
Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and
found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite. <sup>22 </sup>When
Joram saw Jehu, he said, ‘Is it peace, Jehu?’ And he answered, ‘What
peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her
witchcrafts are so many?’ <sup>23 </sup>So Joram reined about and fled
and said to Ahaziah, ‘There is treachery, O Ahaziah!</em>’” (2 Kgs.
9:14-23). The king was at that time in a vulnerable position. The
Syrians had injured him in battle, and he was recovering in the city of
Jezreel, away from the heavily fortified capital of Samaria (2 Kgs.
9:15). King Ahaziah of Judah was Jehoram / Joram’s nephew. Thus, he came
to Jezreel to help tend to and support his wounded uncle (2 Kgs. 8:29).
Even though the King of Judah was there, Jehu and his men still assumed
that it was the right moment to strike. They did not consult God
regarding the timing of their attack. Yet, they still took precautions.
They assumed that the king still had people loyal to him. Jehu therefore
sealed Ramoth-gilead where he planned his coup before marching his army
on the king’s location in Jezreel (2 Kgs. 9:14-15). The king was in fact
paranoid that someone would attack him. Thus, he sent two separate
scouts to Jehu’s army, each inquiring whether Jehu came in “peace.” (2
Kgs. 9:17-18). The third time he asked, God confirmed the answer. He and
his family would find no peace in their rebellion against God. Thus, the
messengers joined in the rebellion.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who live without God live without His peace</u>. In the
Bible, the number two is frequently associated with confirmation. Twice,
Jehoram / Joram sent scouts to Jehu’s army to see if they came in
“peace.” By their silence, Jehu confirmed that the answer was no (2 Kgs.
9:17-18). When he saw Jehu, God made clear the answer to his question.
Jezebel’s “<em>harlotries</em>” “<em>her witchcrafts</em>” and his
rebellion had brought God’s judgment (2 Kgs. 9:22). Those who live in
rebellion against God also live without peace as a sign of their
judgment: ‘“There is no peace for the wicked,’ says the LORD.” (Is.
48:22; 57:21). The fact that Jehoram / Joram sent scouts to his own army
was a sign that he lived without peace. As one commentator notes, “As he
waited to recover full strength in Jezreel, Joram was fundamentally
insecure in his hold on the throne and easily suspected threats.” (David
Guzik on 2 Kgs. 9).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Those who live in the world will
experience tribulation: “These things I have spoken to you, so that in
Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take
courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). Only when you take
refuge in Jesus will you find the peace that surpasses all
understanding: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:7). If
you try to live without God, you will experience Satan’s tribulations
and find no peace without Jesus’ protection.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehu kills Jehoram (Joram)</u>. After confronting Jehoram /
Joram, Jehu confirmed God’s judgment by instantly killing him.
“<em><sup>24 </sup>And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot
Joram between his arms; and the arrow went through his heart and he sank
in his chariot. <sup>25 </sup>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer,
‘Take him up and cast him into the property of the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite, for I remember when you and I were riding together after
Ahab his father, that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> laid this
oracle against him: <sup>26 </sup>‘Surely I have seen yesterday the
blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘and I will repay you in this property,’
says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Now then, take and cast
him into the property, according to the word of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</em>’” (2 Kgs. 9:24-26). Jehu’s arrow
went straight through the heart of Jehoram / Joram. Jehu then kept him
from dying with honor by denying him a proper burial. He further threw
his body in the stolen land that once belonged to Naboth’s family. God
previously told Ahab that his descendants would die after he murdered
Naboth and his family to steal his vineyard (1 Kgs. 21:17-24). Ahab’s
family had reaped what they sowed through their murder, theft and
rebellion against God.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Without Jesus, God will judge every person according to their

deeds: “And lovingkindness is Yours, O Lord, for You recompense a man
according to his work.” (Ps. 62:12; Ro. 2:6). “For He pays a man
according to his work, and makes him find it according to his way.” (Job
34:11). Normally, a child does not die for his father’s sins: “ . . . he
will not die for his father’s iniquity, he will surely live.” (Ezek.
18:17). Yet, Jehoram / Joram shared in his father’s sins because he kept
and profited off of the lands that his father stole. He made no effort
to restore the land. Because God is sovereign, He orchestrated these
events. He arranged for Jehu to confront Jehoram / Joram at or near the
field that Ahab stole from Naboth. This allowed Jehu to cast his body in
the same field as a sign of God’s judgment.</p></li>

<u>Without Jesus, God’s Judgment Cannot be Escaped or Avoided</u>. 2

<ul>
<li><p><u>Ahaziah tries unsuccessfully to hide from God’s judgment</u>.
Because Ahaziah was a descendant of Ahab and a Baal worshiper, Jehu also
caught him after he fled and executed him: “<sup>27 </sup><em>When
Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden
house. And Jehu pursued him and said, ‘Shoot him too, in the chariot.’
So they shot him at the ascent of Gur, which is at Ibleam. But he fled
to Megiddo and died there. <sup>28 </sup>Then his servants carried him
in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his grave with his fathers
in the city of David.’ <sup>29 </sup>Now in the eleventh year of Joram,
the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah</em>.” (2 Kgs. 9:27-29).
In 2 Chronicles, the Bible records that Ahaziah hid in Samaria. Yet,
because God was guiding Jehu’s judgment, his men found him: “He also
sought Ahaziah, and they caught him while he was hiding in Samaria; they
brought him to Jehu, put him to death and buried him. For they said, ‘He
is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart.’ So
there was no one of the house of Ahaziah to retain the power of the
kingdom.” (2 Chr. 22:9). Jehu, however, allowed Ahaziah to be buried in
Jerusalem because his father was a godly man.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God judged Ahaziah for following after Ahab’s worship of
Baal</u>. It might seem that Jehu acted beyond his mandate by killing
Ahaziah, the King of Judah. Yet, Ahaziah shared in the judgment for two
reasons. First, he shared in Ahab’s judgment because he was Ahab’s
grandson. His mother Athaliah was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (2
Kgs. 8:26). Second, he followed after Ahab’s Baal worship:
“<sup>27 </sup>He walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in
the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, like the house of
Ahab had done, . . .” (2 Kgs. 8:27). God judged him with a one-year
reign (2 Kgs. 8:26). Because he also stumbled God’s people with Baal
worship, his judgment included a brutal death.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Ahaziah could not escape God’s judgment by fleeing</u>.
Ahaziah tried to flee from his judgment (2 Kg. 9:27). Yet, he failed.
Without Jesus to pay the judgment price, all face certain death: “What
man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power
of Sheol? Selah.” (Ps. 89:48). “Indeed, there is not a righteous man on
earth who continually does good and who never sins.” (Ecc. 7:20; Rom.
3:23). “When they sin against You (for there is no man who does not sin)
. . .” (1 Kgs. 8:46). Only through Jesus’ free gift can you hope to
escape the wages of your sins (Ro. 6:23).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jehu has Jezebel killed</u>. In her final moments, Jezebel
taunted Jehu. Jehu then had her killed and allowed dogs to feed off her
rotting corpse: “<sup>30 </sup><em>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel
heard of it, and she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked
out the window. <sup>31 </sup>As Jehu entered the gate, she said, ‘Is it
well, Zimri, your master’s murderer?’ <sup>32 </sup>Then he lifted up
his face to the window and said, ‘Who is on my side? Who?’ And two or
three officials looked down at him. <sup>33 </sup>He said, ‘Throw her
down.’ So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on
the wall and on the horses, and he trampled her under foot.
<sup>34 </sup>When he came in, he ate and drank; and he said, ‘See now
to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.’
<sup>35 </sup>They went to bury her, but they found nothing more of her
than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
<sup>36 </sup>Therefore they returned and told him. And he said, ‘This
is the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, which He spoke
by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘In the property of Jezreel
the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel; <sup>37 </sup>and the corpse of
Jezebel will be as dung on the face of the field in the property of
Jezreel, so they cannot say, ‘This is Jezebel</em>.’’’” (2 Kgs.
9:30-37). Out of pride, Jezebel painted her eyes to look like a queen
when Jehu arrived for her. Or, some believe that she painted her eyes to
show that she would proudly die as the harlot of Baal. She then taunted
Jehu by comparing him to the murderous traitor Zimri who ruled for only
seven days (1 Kgs. 16:9-10, 15). Jehu then fulfilled a prophecy by
having her killed and by allowing dogs to eat her dead body.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God judges the proud and those who reject Him</u>. Because her
wickedness and pride surpassed all other women in the Bible, Jezebel is
associated with the false spirit of deceit and rebellion against God:
“But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who
calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My bond-servants
astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrificed
to idols.” (Rev. 2:20). Like Jezebel, God will judge prideful people who
reject Him: “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the
LORD; assuredly, he will not be unpunished.” (Prov. 16:5). “The proud
look of man will be abased and the loftiness of man will be humbled, and
the LORD alone will be exalted in that day . . . Thus I will punish the
world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an
end to the arrogance of the proud and abase the haughtiness of the
ruthless.” (Is. 2:11; 13:11). Thus, you should always walk with humility
and obedience to Jesus as your Lord and Savior.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God by hating evil</u>. Many years earlier, Elijah
prophesied exactly how Jezebel would die (1 Kgs. 21:19-29). Her death
showed that God is sovereign and that His Word is always fulfilled. Only
by fearing God can you keep your heart from embracing evil: “By
lovingkindness and truth iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the
LORD one keeps away from evil.” (Prov. 16:6). The fear of the Lord is
defined as hating evil: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; . . .”
(Prov. 8:13). Are you tolerating evil in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent and avoid God’s judgment</u>. God does not want to
judge anyone. Thus, He offers to forgive even the worst of sinners like
Ahab when they repent: ‘“For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone
who dies,’ declares the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span>.
‘Therefore, repent and live.”’ (Ezek. 18:32). “This is good and
acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be
saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3-4). These
accounts of judgment should horrify all people. Each person should
repent of their pride, rebellion and deceit and turn to Jesus. God’s
judgment cannot be avoided. Yet, Jesus died on the cross to pay the
judgment price for all who believe (Jo. 3:16; 1 Jo. 2:2). Are there any
sins that you need to stop and repent of?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that Jesus has paid for your sins</u>. The Bible’s
stories of judgment should cause every believer to say “there, but for
the grace of God, go I.” (John Bradford) Have you given thanks for the
price that Jesus paid for your sins? “always giving thanks for all
things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;”
(Eph. 5:20).</p></li>
