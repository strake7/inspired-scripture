<h1 id="judges-7-lessons-on-spiritual-warfare-from-the-midianites-defeat">Judges 7: Lessons on Spiritual Warfare from the Midianites’ Defeat</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter tells how God reduced a Jewish army from 32,000 to only 300 men in order to defeat a massive army of 135,000 Midianite troops. God tested both Gideon’s faith and the faith of his soldiers. He showed that He is in control, and no army can stand in His way. He also showed that the glory belongs to Him alone. This account is important today because He reveals through this story seven lessons on prevailing in spiritual warfare. “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12).</p>
<p><u>First</u>, from God’s command to Gideon to reduce the size of his army, He reveals that success in spiritual warfare requires that you trust Him and have faith in Him alone to win the battle. <u>Second</u>, from His command for Gideon to dismiss all his fearful soldiers, He reveals that success in spiritual warfare requires that you cast out all fear of your enemy. <u>Third</u>, from His command to Gideon to dismiss all the soldiers who were not ready for battle, He reveals that success in spiritual warfare requires that you remain vigilant against the schemes of the enemy. <u>Fourth</u>, through His encouragement to Gideon through an enemy soldier’s dream, He reveals that He will encourage you and lead you through the Spirit when you trust Him. <u>Fifth</u>, from the soldier’s dream of a lowly barley loaf that defeated the Midianites, He reveals that He lifts up and exalts the humble. <u>Sixth</u>, from the Jews’ battle cry for God that terrorized the enemy soldiers, He reveals that His name is powerful and will cause fear within the enemy when you use it in faith while praying. <u>Finally</u>, from Gideon’s call for others to join in chasing the enemy, He reveals the success in spiritual warfare requires that you work with others in the body of Christ.</p>

<li><p><u>God’s command for Gideon to reduce the size of his army</u>. After God assembled an army under Gideon’s command to defeat the Midianites, He instructed Gideon to reduce its size of his army so that they would not be tempted to boast that they had defeated the enemy based upon their own might: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him, rose early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley. <sup>2</sup> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, ‘The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, for Israel would become boastful, saying, ‘My own power has delivered me</em>.’” (Jdgs. 7:1-2). God’s instructions tested Gideon’s faith. His army was already smaller than the army that he faced. Without any troop reductions, he had 32,000 men (Jdgs. 7:3) against 135,000 troops (Jdgs. 8:10). Thus, the enemy troops outnumbered the Jews by more than 4 to 1. Most military historians believe that an attacking army should outnumber the defending army by at least a three to one ratio. Thus, Gideon should have had an army of 405,000 troops before attacking the Midianites. By the time God had reduced the Jews to 300 men (Jdgs. 7:6), the Midianites outnumbered the Jews by a ratio of 450 to 1! God wanted to make sure that no one else could claim credit for their victory. But God was also testing the faith of His commander. Just like the battle of Jericho (Josh. 6), His military strategy made no sense in purely human terms.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God alone will deliver you in battle against the evil one</u>. The message for believers today is that you should never rely upon your own strength to defeat your spiritual enemy. Instead, like Joshua and Gideon, God wants you to put your faith and trust in Him alone: “Some boast in chariots and some in horses, but we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not delivered by great strength.” (Ps. 33:16). “For by their own sword they did not possess the land, and their own arm did not save them, but Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your presence, for You favored them.” (Ps. 44:3). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). “Do not trust in princes, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). “But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen.” (Hos. 1:7). Do you trust in God alone to deliver you from the enemy? Or, are you relying upon your own skills and abilities?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will remember you with a special name for your faith in Him</u>. Although Gideon was an idolater who struggled to trust God, God remembered Him with two names to celebrate His faith and obedience. God named Him Gideon, which translates as “Great Warrior.” He also named him Jerubbaal: “Then the LORD sent <em>Jerubbaal</em> and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security.” (1 Sam. 12:11). The name “Jerubbaal” means “contender with Baal” because he destroyed the altar of Baal (Jdgs. 6:32; 7:1; 8:29). Jesus also promises to rename you in the future: “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.’” (Rev. 2:17). Are you engaging in acts of faith, charity, compassion, love, and kindness to give Him lots of opportunities to rename you?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-successful-spiritual-warrior-never-fears-the-enemy.-judges-73.">2. <u>A Successful Spiritual Warrior Never Fears the Enemy</u>. Judges 7:3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s command for Gideon to dismiss all the soldiers who were fearful</u>. To reduce the size of his army, God first instructed Gideon to dismiss any soldier who was fearful of the enemy: “<sup>3</sup> <em>Now therefore come, proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’ So 22,000 people returned, but 10,000 remained</em>.” (Jdgs. 7:3). God did not want any person fighting in His army who feared the enemy. Such a person had no trust in Him: “When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you.” (Dt. 20:1). “He shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel, you are approaching the battle against your enemies today. Do not be fainthearted. Do not be afraid, or panic, or tremble before them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’” (Dt. 20:3-4). Without faith, these men were of no use to God. Without faith, it is “impossible” to please Him (Heb. 11:6). If you fear anything other than God your faith is lacking.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear is “false evidence appearing real”</u>. The Lord is the only thing that you are to fear (Prov. 1:7), which is defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:12). “The fear of man brings a snare. But he who trusts in the Lord will be exalted.” (Prov. 29:25). J. Vernon McGee observed that: “when you are afraid and you have lost your faith, difficulties and problems are magnified. They become greater than they really are.” (Thru the Bible Commentary Series, Numbers p. 90). Although David was the smallest man in his family, he feared no evil or any enemy because he had faith that God was fighting for him. “The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread?. . . Though a host encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war arises against me, in spite of this I shall be confident.” (Ps. 27:1-3). “I fear no evil, for you are with me.” (Ps. 23:4). “How blessed is the man that fears the Lord . . . He will not fear evil tidings” (Ps. 112:7). “Say to the anxious heart, ‘take courage, fear not.” (Is. 34:4). Is there any person, thing or enemy that you fear? If so, Satan may use that fear to ensnare you and cause your faith in Jesus to falter.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you walk with God, your enemy will flee from you</u>. When you walk in faith and obedience, God promises to install fear into your enemy and cause them to flee from you: “One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you.” (Josh. 23:10). “The LORD shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you one way and will flee before you seven ways.” (Dt. 28:7). ‘“But you will chase your enemies and they will fall before you by the sword; five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword.’” (Lev. 26:7-8). When you take refuge in God, He promises to be a shield to the evil attacks of the enemy: “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5; 2 Sam. 22:31). With His help, Jonathon also killed many Philistines (1 Sam. 14:12). His power also allowed David to kill Goliath (1 Sam. 17:50-58). He does not want you to fear any enemy (Ro. 8:15). Are you walking faith and obedience so that He can act on your behalf to cause your enemies to flee from you?</p></li>

<h2 id="a-successful-spiritual-warrior-is-always-vigilant-against-the-enemy.-judges-74-8.">3. <u>A Successful Spiritual Warrior is Always Vigilant Against the Enemy</u>. Judges 7:4-8.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s command for Gideon to dismiss the soldiers who were not vigilant</u>. To further reduce the size of the army, God instructed Gideon to send the men to a stream to drink. Those who drank while looking down (instead of drinking water out of their hands while looking forward) would be dismissed: “<sup>4</sup> <em>Then the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, ‘The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.’ <sup>5</sup> So he brought the people down to the water. And the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, ‘You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.’ <sup>6</sup> Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water. <sup>7</sup> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, ‘I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home.’ <sup>8</sup> So the 300 men took the people’s provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And Gideon sent all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300 men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley</em>.” (Jdgs. 7:4-8). The people who did not drink water from a cupped hand were not watchful of their surroundings. They symbolized those who took their eyes off God and the schemes and attacks of the enemy.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Fear comes when we take our eyes off the Lord</u>. The men who looked at the water while drinking instead of cupping the water in their hands symbolized the people who would take their eyes off God. We see this in Peter’s encounter with Jesus on the stormy Sea of Galilee. Peter began to walk on water when Jesus called him (Matt. 14:29). “But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord save me.” (Matt. 14:30). After saving him, Jesus responded: “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” (Matt. 14:31). Paul reveals that it is the “spirit of slavery” which “lead[s] to fear.” (Ro. 8:15). The last time you felt fear, were you looking at the violent storms or conflicts around you? Did you take your eyes off Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Lift up your eyes and Jesus will show you where to serve Him</u>. Jesus also advises you to lift up your eyes so that He can show you the many people around you that need your help: “Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, <em>lift up your eyes</em> and look on the fields, that they are white for harvest.” (Jo. 4:35). Have you lifted your eyes so that He can show you where to serve Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be vigilant against the attacks of the evil one</u>. In addition to keeping your eyes on God, your eyes must be vigilant in watching for the enemy’s attacks: “Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.” (Matt. 10:16; Lk. 10:3). “Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” (1 Pet. 5:8). “Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 1:13). Are you watching for influences in your life or your family’s life that may cause you or your family to sin?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-successful-spiritual-warrior-is-led-by-the-spirit.-judges-79-11.">4. <u>A Successful Spiritual Warrior is Led by the Spirit</u>. Judges 7:9-11.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s encouragement to Gideon through an enemy soldier’s dream</u>. God knew that Gideon was filled with fear being forced to fight with only 300 men. Thus, He sought to encourage him by inviting him to spy on the Midianite camp where he would overhear of prophecy of the Jews’ victory: “<sup>9</sup> <em>Now the same night it came about that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, ‘Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands. <sup>10</sup> But if you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp, <sup>11</sup> and you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened that you may go down against the camp.’ So he went with Purah his servant down to the outposts of the army that was in the camp.”</em> (Jdgs. 7:9-11). God had reduced Gideon’s army to less than one percent of its original size. Gideon must have felt that it was pure madness to attack in such a weakened state. But God perfects believers in their weakness. “And He has said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.’ Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.” (2 Cor. 12:9). When Gideon was humbled, he was in a perfect place for God to build him back up through the Spirit. In the same way that God sought to encourage Gideon, He seeks to encourage you when you are weak and dependent upon Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be encouraged and led by the Spirit</u>. Like Gideon, God knows when your faith is weak. When you let His Spirit lead you, He will encourage you: “On the day I called, You answered me; You made me bold with strength in my soul.” (Ps. 138:3). “He said, ‘O man of high esteem, do not be afraid. Peace be with you; take courage and be courageous!’ Now as soon as he spoke to me, I received strength and said, ‘May my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”’ (Dan. 10:19). “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (Ro. 8:14). If you are feeling weak or depressed, are you praying in faith for Him to strengthen and encourage you?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-successful-spiritual-warrior-is-lifted-up-when-humble.-judges-712-15.">5. <u>A Successful Spiritual Warrior is Lifted up When Humble</u>. Judges 7:12-15.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The lowly barley loaf that defeated the Midianites</u>. The dream that Gideon overheard involved a lowly barely bread loaf (something that only poor people ate) destroying the tent of the mighty Midianites: <em>“<sup>12</sup> Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. <sup>13</sup> When Gideon came, behold, a man was relating a dream to his friend. And he said, ‘Behold, I had a dream; a loaf of barley bread was tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.’ <sup>14</sup> His friend replied, ‘This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.’ <sup>15</sup> When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of Israel and said, ‘Arise, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has given the camp of Midian into your hands</em>.’” (Jdgs. 7:12-15). Barley was the first food that came from the first of three seasonal harvests. Because it did not taste as good as wheat (which grows longer before being harvested) it was cheaper to buy. It was also considered to be the food of poor people. Each of the three harvests represents a stage in a believer’s walk with God: (1) barley symbolized justification, (2) wheat symbolized sanctification, and (3) fruit symbolized glorification. Barley was offered during the Feast of First Fruits (Lev. 23:9-14). This corresponded with Christ’s resurrection and symbolized the offering of a new believer (1 Cor. 15:20). When Jesus fed the masses of followers, he used “five <em>barley</em> loaves and two small fishes.” (Jo. 6:9). When they were filled, He said unto His disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.” (Jo. 6:12). These believers were part of the masses. They were not close to Jesus. But they were saved and had overcome death. Gideon was like the barley loaf. He was rejected by most of the people and was poor in spirit. Yet, with God’s power, he knocked over the mighty Midianites. God encouraged Gideon through this account to bolster his faith.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will lift you up when you are humble</u>. Like Gideon, God will lift you up when you humble yourself in faith to Him: “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:10). “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, and has exalted those who were humble.” (Lk. 1:52). Have you humbled yourself before God?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-successful-spiritual-warrior-gives-glory-to-lord.-judges-716-22.">6. <u>A Successful Spiritual Warrior Gives Glory to Lord</u>. Judges 7:16-22.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The battle cry for God that terrorized the enemy soldiers</u>. Gideon’s troops used psychological warfare to defeat the Midianites. His men created the impression that a much larger army existed by having them shout the Lord’s name and blow His shofar from three directions simultaneously: “<sup>16</sup> <em>He divided the 300 men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers. <sup>17</sup> He said to them, ‘Look at me and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. <sup>18</sup> When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet, then you also blow the trumpets all around the camp and say, ‘For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and for Gideon.’ <sup>19</sup> So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands. <sup>20</sup> When the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing, and cried, ‘A sword for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and for Gideon !’ <sup>21</sup> Each stood in his place around the camp; and all the army ran, crying out as they fled. <sup>22</sup> When they blew 300 trumpets, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> set the sword of one against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the edge of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath</em>.” (Jdgs. 7:16-22). It was the power of God’s name heard from three directions from three groups of 100 men (symbolizing the Trinity) that caused the enemy to panic. The torches symbolized the light of the Word (Ps. 119:105). The “sword for the Lord” also symbolized the power of the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). The shofar trumpet (a ram’s horn) symbolized His power: “For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12). In faith, Jesus’ also wants you to pray in His name and in His Word.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Pray in the power of Jesus’ holy name</u>. Jesus instructed that the model prayer should specifically start by acknowledging God’s holy name: “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father who is in heaven, <em>hallowed be Your name</em> . . .” (Matt. 6:9). To “hallow” a thing is to make it holy or to set it apart as being worthy of devotion. Alternatively, to “hallow” the name of God is to regard Him with complete devotion and loving admiration. Throughout the Psalms, the psalmist also specifically and repeatedly referred to the “glory” God’s holy name as an example for us in both prayer and song: “Ascribe to the Lord <em>the glory due His name</em>; bring an offering, and come before Him; worship the Lord in holy array.” (1 Ch. 16:29). “O magnify the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with me, and <em>let us exalt His name together</em>.” (Ps. 34:3). “Ascribe to the Lord <em>the glory due to His name</em>; worship the Lord in holy array.” (Ps. 29:2). “All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and <em>they shall glorify Your name</em>.” (Ps. 86:9). “God is known in Judah; <em>His name is great</em> in Israel.” (Ps. 76:1). “A Psalm, a song for the Sabbath day. It is good to give thanks to the Lord and to <em>sing praises to Your name</em>, O Most High;” (Ps. 92:1). “I will be glad and exult in You; I will <em>sing praise to Your name</em>, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness and will <em>sing praise to the name</em> of the Lord most high.” (Ps. 7:17). “<em>Sing the glory of His name</em>; make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:2). “Sing to God, <em>sing praises to His name</em>; lift up a song for Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the Lord, and exult before Him.” (Ps. 68:4). “Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; <em>sing praises to His name</em>, for it is lovely.” (Ps. 135:3). Are you specifically calling Jesus’ name “holy” in your prayers?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The “power of attorney” given to use Jesus’ name</u>. Believers are also commanded to gather in Jesus’ <em>name</em> (Matt. 18:20). We are to “make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them <em>in the name</em> of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 28:19). In the book of Acts, the early disciples also frequently referred to their service, worship, and suffering as being done in Jesus Christ’s “name.” (e.g., Acts 4:18; 5:28, 41; 10:43; 19:17). His name is above every other name: “For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,” (Phil. 2:9). When you pray in faith, Jesus has given you the legal equivalent of a “power of attorney” to pray in the <em>name</em> of Jesus Christ. “Whatever you <em>ask in My name, that will I do,</em> so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <em>If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it</em>.” (Jo. 14:13-14). “You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that <em>whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you</em>.” (Jo. 15:16). “In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, <em>if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you</em>.” (Jo. 16:23). His name is so powerful that the archangel Michael was able to drive Satan away merely by rebuking him in His name (Jude 1:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praying in Jesus’ name and His Word is also the antidote to fear</u>. What do you do when your faith is lacking? “[F]aith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” (Ro. 10:17). When the mighty Philistine army taunted Saul, he and his troops were afraid (1 Sam. 17:11). But David showed no fear when he approached the Philistine army. He said that they approached with swords and spears. But he approached in “the name of the Lord” (1 Sam. 17:45). The next time you fear, recite Jesus’ promises and His name in faith as you pray: “Do not fear for I am with you; do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand . . . Do not fear, I will help you.” (Is. 41:10, 13). “For I know the plans I have for you . . . plans for welfare and not calamity to give you a future and a hope.” (Jer. 29:11). “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, <em>but of power</em> and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7). Jesus warns that you will experience tribulation in the world (Jo. 16:33). Yet, through Him, you can overcome this tribulation with the peace that surpasses all understanding (Phil. 4:7). There is nothing “able to separate us from the love of God.” (Rom. 8:38). Knowing this, “perfect love casts out fear. . . ” (1 Jo. 4:18). The next time you fear, pray in Jesus’ powerful name to boost your faith, remind yourself of His love, and ask Him to cast out your fears.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Also give credit to Jesus alone for your successes</u>. Although Gideon used the Lord’s holy name to drive off the enemy, he sinned by having his soldiers also call out his name during the battle cry. When you lift up your own name, it leads to pride. “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18). His spiral into sin becomes more evident after God won the battle. By contrast, the great leaders in the Bible all gave credit to God alone for their victories. For example, Joseph gave credit to God for his ability to interpret dreams: “Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying, ‘It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.’” (Gen. 41:16). Paul also clarified that a believer’s abilities come from God alone: “Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,” (2 Cor. 3:5). “For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,” (Ro. 15:18). “Then he said to me, ‘This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ says the LORD of hosts.’” (Zech. 4:6). Do you credit Jesus for your successes?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Also give thanks in Jesus’ name</u>. The Psalmist also gave thanks for God’s holy name: “Willingly I will sacrifice to You; <em>I will give thanks to Your name, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for it is good</em>.” (Ps. 54:6). “It is good to <em>give thanks</em> to the Lord, and to sing praises to Your <em>name</em>, O Most High.” (Ps. 92:1). “<em>I will be glad</em> and exult in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2).

<ul>
<li><p><u>Gideon’s call for his brothers to join in the battle against the enemy</u>. After Gideon’s 300 men routed the enemy, He called upon others in the nearby hill country of Ephraim to join in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy. “<em><sup>23</sup> The men of Israel were summoned from Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.</em> <sup>24</sup> <em>Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, ‘Come down against Midian and take the waters before them, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.’ So all the men of Ephraim were summoned and they took the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. <sup>25</sup> They captured the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, while they pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan</em>.” (Jdgs. 7:24-25). Only by working together could the Jews capture the enemy. Through this example, God provides lessons on working with others in spiritual warfare.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek help from your brothers and sisters</u>. God was careful to include in the same story Gideon’s request for help from his brothers and sisters in chasing after the enemy. He does not want you to draw from this account that you need to act alone. He calls believers “sheep.” (Jo. 10:27). Sheep have no natural defenses. When you act alone, you put yourself at risk for the enemy’s attacks (1 Pet. 5:8). To obtain the protection offered from God’s flock, you must stay connected to others in Church: “not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:25). “But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.” (Heb. 13:22). “But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called ‘Today,’ so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (Heb. 3:13). Are you seeking help from your brothers and sisters when you feel persecuted or under attack?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fight with your brothers and sisters in Christ in one accord</u>. Like those whom Gideon called to service, believers in Jesus are also commanded to “fight the good fight of faith . . . ” (1 Tim. 6:12). Believers are also called upon to fight in His army (2 Tim. 2:3). It is also not enough to merely fight with your brothers and sisters, you must also act with one accord as the Spirit leads the body (Eph. 4:3). You ensure that you are acting in one accord when you are motivated by love: “Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.” (Col. 3:14). Are you acting with love and one accord with your brothers and sisters in Christ? Or, are you acting for your glory?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be encouraged that Jesus has already won the war</u>. Just as God’s army captured the enemy’s leaders, He has also defeated your spiritual enemy. His days are numbered. If you feel the enemy is attacking you, take comfort that Jesus has already won the war.</p></li>
