<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 119 is a masterpiece of Hebrew poetry. It is called an alphabetic acrostic psalm. Here, the psalmist wrote 176 verses, which are divided into 22 stanzas. Each of the 22 stanzas corresponds with the consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, from “<em>Aleph</em>” (<span dir="rtl">א</span>) to “<em>Tav</em>” (<span dir="rtl">ת</span>ּ). Within each of the 22 stanzas, there are exactly eight verses. Each verse within each stanza also starts with the same Hebrew letter. Moreover, 171 of the 176 verses praise what can collectively be referred to as God’s “Scripture”. This includes His Law “<em>torah</em>” (25 times), Word “<em>dabar</em>” (24 times), judgments “<em>mispatim</em>” (23 times), testimony “<em>edut/edot”</em> (23 times), commands “<em>miswah/miswot</em>” (22 times), statutes “<em>huqqim</em>” (21 times), precepts “<em>piqqudim</em>” (21 times), and sayings, oracles, or promises “<em>imrah</em>” (19 times). Because the Law or the Ten Commandments are most frequently mentioned, some even call this a “torah psalm”.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> By using every letter of the Hebrew alphabet in 8-verse stanzas, “the poet was trying to ensure that his treatment of a particular topic was complete. At the same time, the reader gained the impression that the poem he was reading covered every angle.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These verses all foreshadow Jesus Christ. He is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). He is also the “Apha” and the “Omega” (Rev. 1:8). Because of the style employed, this the longest chapter in the Bible, with 1065 Hebrew words. But it is filled with valuable lessons. According to British Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892), “The one theme is the word of the Lord. The Psalmist sets his subject in many lights, and treats of it in divers ways, but he seldom omits to mention the word of the Lord in each verse under some one or other of the many names by which he knows it;  . . . This sacred ode is a little Bible, the Scriptures condensed, a mass of Bibline, Holy Writ rewritten in holy emotions and actions.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Some believe that David wrote this psalm. Others believe that a post-exile psalmist wrote it. In Psalm 119, the Bible reveals several lessons regarding the value of fully trusting God’s holy Scripture. Trust in His Scripture should lead to your: (1) voluntary obedience, (2) revival, (3) salvation, (4) faith, (5) love, (6) guidance, and (7) depending on Him.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in the first three stanzas, the psalmist reveals that trust in God’s Scripture should lead to your desire to diligently obey His Law out of devotion, not obligation. When you obey God for the right reasons, His Word will purify you and allow Him to bless you. <u>Second</u>, in the fourth and fifth stanzas, the psalmist reveals that trust and meditation on God’s Scripture can lead to your spiritual revival. <u>Third</u>, in the sixth through eighth stanzas, the psalmist reveals that trust in God’s Scripture leads to Jesus’ path for your salvation, hope, and joy. <u>Fourth</u>, in the ninth through twelfth stanzas, the psalmist reveals that trust and meditation on God’s Scripture can grow your faith in Him. It should also cause you to see Scripture as your greatest treasure. <u>Fifth</u>, in the thirteenth stanza, the psalmist reveals that trust and meditation on God’s Law can cause you to fall in love with it. <u>Sixth</u>, in the fourteenth through eighteenth stanzas, the psalmist reveals that God’s Scripture can be a light to guide your path to Him. <u>Finally</u>, in the nineteenth through twenty-second stanzas, the psalmist reveals that God’s Scripture can cause you to learn to depend upon Him for all your needs and to cry out to Him when you need deliverance.</p>

Ps. 119:1-24.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u><em><strong>Aleph (</strong></em><span dir="rtl">א</span><em><strong>):</strong></em> Obey God’s Scripture with diligence and devotion</u>. God promises to bless those who voluntarily and diligently obey His Law and choose to walk in His ways. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em><u>Blessed</u> are those whose way is blameless, who <u>walk in the Law</u> of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><u>Blessed</u> are those who <u>comply</u> with His testimonies, and <u>seek Him</u> with <u>all their heart</u>. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>They also do no injustice; they <u>walk in His ways</u>. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>You have ordained Your precepts, that we are to <u>keep them</u> <u>diligently</u>. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Oh that my ways may be established to keep Your statutes! <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then I will not be ashamed when I look at all Your commandments. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>I will give thanks to You with uprightness of heart, when I learn Your righteous judgments. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>I <u>will keep</u> Your statutes; do not utterly abandon me!</em>” (Ps. 119:1-8). Martin Luther interpreted Psalm 119:1-2 as a promise of blessing for those, ‘“Who live without blemish’ or stain. The idea is, ‘Blessed are they who are upright, sincere, perfect, in their course.’ The whole psalm is designed to illustrate this thought, by showing what the influence of a sincere and conscientious attachment to the principles of the law or word of God in the various circumstances of life must be.” (quoted by Albert Barnes on Ps. 119:1-2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The psalmist used poetry with the Hebrew letter <em>(</em><span dir="rtl">א</span><em>)</em> to show the blessings of obedience<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Obedience produces blessings unrelated to salvation</u>. God’s promises to bless the obedient are repeated in many other verses. “Praise the LORD! <em>Blessed</em> is a person who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.” (Ps. 112:1). “<em>Blessed</em> is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in His ways.” (Ps. 128:1). “Now then, sons, listen to me, for <em>blessed</em> are those who keep my ways.” (Prov. 8:32). In Deuteronomy 28, Moses enumerated ten blessings that come through obedience.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But a believer in Jesus Christ cannot earn his or her salvation through acts of obedience. Everyone is a sinner and has fallen short of God’s standards (Ecc. 7:20; Rom. 3:23). Moreover, if salvation through works were possible, Jesus died needlessly (Gal. 2:21). Nevertheless, Jesus did not revoke the promises of blessing through obedience. “But He said, ‘On the contrary, <em>blessed</em> are those who hear the word of God and follow it.”’ (Lk. 11:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey Jesus’ Ten Commandments out of love, not obligation</u>. The psalmist declared a blessing for those who obey God’s “<em>Law</em>” (Ps. 119:1)<em>.</em> Many assume that this means God’s Word generally and not His Law or the Ten Commandments. But the psalmist used separate words to distinguish God’s Law from His Word. Again, believers are no longer “under the Law” in the sense that they must comply with it to be saved (Gal. 5:18; Ro. 7:6; 8:3). By “fulfilling” the Law, Jesus freed believers from the impossible task of trying to obtain salvation through the Law (Matt. 5:17). But Jesus also says that, if you love Him, you will keep His Commandments: “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.”  (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6). Before God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Horeb, He revealed His name to be the great “I AM” (Ex. 3:13-15). Jesus later stated that He is the great “I AM.”  (Jo. 8:57-58). Thus, Jesus gave the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Horeb.  Whether you follow His Commandments out of love is also a test for whether you really know Him (1 John 2:3; 1 Cor. 7:19).  Do you follow His Commandments out of love and not obligation?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Loving God is the greatest Commandment</u>. The psalmist urged believers to “<em>seek Him with all their heart.</em>” (Ps. 119:2). When asked to identify the greatest of the Ten Commandments, Jesus also stated that it was to love God with all your heart: “And He said to him, ‘you shall love the Lord your God <em>with all your heart</em>, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”’ (Matt. 22:37; Mk. 12:30; Lk. 10:27). “And you shall love the LORD your God <em>with all your heart</em> and with all your soul and with all your strength.” (Dt. 6:5). “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him, and to serve the LORD your God <em>with all your heart</em> and with all your soul,” (Dt. 10:12). “And it shall come about, if you listen obediently to my commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him <em>with all your heart and all your soul</em>,” (Dt. 11:13). “This day the LORD your God commands you to perform these statutes and ordinances. Therefore you shall be careful to perform them <em>with all your heart and with all your soul</em>.” (Dt. 26:16). “[I]f you obey the LORD your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, if you turn to the LORD your God <em>with all your heart and soul</em>.” (Dt. 30:10). When you love God with all your heart and soul, you will desire to obey His Ten Commandments out of devotion, not obligation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obeying Scripture should include a desire to submit to Him out of love</u>. Many profess a belief in God. But few allow Scripture to define what is right or wrong. Submission to God should be an emotional response driven by love. Thus, you should submit to Him with all your heart (Ps. 119:2). “God is not truly sought by the cold researches of the brain: we must seek him with the heart. Love reveals itself to love: God manifests his heart to the heart of his people. It is in vain that we endeavour to comprehend him by reason; we must apprehend him by affection.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be diligent in your obedience</u>. Regarding the precepts of the Law, the psalmist stated that believers are “<em>to keep them diligently.</em>” (Ps. 119:4). After Moses gave the Ten Commandments, Moses also stated that believers were expected to be diligent in observing them. “You shall <em>diligently keep the commandments</em> of the LORD your God, and His provisions and His statutes which He has commanded you.” (Dt. 6:17). This means that you need to take active steps to guard your heart from drifting into sin.</p></li>
<li><p><u><em><strong>Beth (</strong></em><span dir="rtl">ב</span><em><strong>ּ):</strong></em> Obedience leading to purity should include memorization and meditation</u>. Because of our sinful nature, you are more likely to remain pure when you memorize and meditate on God’s Scripture with all your heart. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it according to Your word. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>With <u>all my heart</u> I have sought You; do not let me wander from Your commandments. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>I have treasured Your word <u>in my heart</u>, so that I may not sin against You. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Blessed are You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; <u>teach me</u> Your statutes. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>With my lips I have told of all the ordinances of Your mouth. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all riches. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><u>I will meditate</u> on Your precepts and regard Your ways. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I shall delight in Your statutes; <u>I will</u> <u>not forget</u> Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:9-16). “To have God’s word of promise laid up in the heart is the only security against being surprised into sin.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 119:11).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The psalmist used poetry with letter <em>Beth (</em><span dir="rtl">ב</span><em>ּ)</em> to urge believers to memorize God’s Word<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word wash you of your sins</u>. The psalmist stated that obedience to God’s Word is the only route to purity. “<em>How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:9). Jesus made clear that His Word will purify you of your sins when you repent. “<em>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you</em>.” (Jo. 15:3). “so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her <em>by the washing of water with the word</em>,” (Eph. 5:26). “When Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness and on the high mountain and at the temple pinnacle, in each case Jesus answered the temptation of Satan with, ‘It is written.’ He used the Word of God to answer every temptation that the enemy threw in His path. We need to have the Word of God in our hearts that we might be able to withstand every temptation that Satan throws in our path. ‘Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Thy Word.”’ (Chuck Smith on Ps. 119:9).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Thus, turn to God’s Word to avoid sin.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Memorize God’s Law to guard your heart from sin</u>. To be pure, the psalmist vowed, “<em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>I have treasured Your word in my heart, so that I may not sin against You.</em>” (Ps. 119:11). David also vowed to guard his heart to serve God. “A Psalm of David. I said, ‘<em>I will keep watch over my ways</em> so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep watch over my mouth as with a muzzle while the wicked are in my presence.”’ (Ps. 39:1). He knew that this required memorization of God’s Law. “<em>The Law of his God is in his heart</em>; his steps do not slip.” (Ps. 37:31). In Solomon’s prayer of dedication, he also warned that David’s descendants needed to be careful to guard their ways (1 Kgs. 8:25; 2 Chr. 6:16). Are you memorizing God’s Scripture and praying for the Spirit to guard your heart for His use?</p></li>

<p>Memorize and meditate on God’s Law to protect yourself from sin<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Humble yourself and pray to seek God’s guidance</u>. The psalmist asked God, “<em>teach me Your statutes.</em>” (Ps. 119:12). This required humility, prayer, and submission. “This demonstrates the humility of the psalmist. Though filled with God’s word and a desire for purity, he sensed his constant need for instruction by God. He didn’t simply need to <em>read</em> God’s <strong>statutes</strong>; he pleaded with God to <strong>teach</strong> him. This saying is written in the front of some Bibles: ‘This book will keep you from sin. Sin will keep you from this book.’ The psalmist understood this principle, and longed for God to be his teacher, and to keep him in God’s great book.” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:12) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Meditate on God’s Law to guard your heart from sin</u>. To be pure, the psalmist vowed, “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>I will meditate on Your precepts and regard Your ways</em>.” (Ps. 119:15). Others also vowed to meditate on God’s Law: “But <em>his delight is in the Law</em> of the LORD, and <em>on His Law he meditates day and night</em>.” (Ps. 1:2). “I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; I will certainly remember Your wonders of old. <em>I will meditate on all Your work</em>, and on Your deeds with thanksgiving.” (Ps. 77:11-12). “Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; <em>tell of all His wonders</em>.” (Ps. 105:2). “I remember the days of old; <em>I meditate on all Your accomplishments; I reflect on the work of Your hands</em>.” (Ps. 143:5). “On the glorious splendor of Your majesty and <em>on Your wonderful works, I will meditate</em>.” (Ps. 145:5). “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall <em>meditate on it day and night</em>, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will achieve success.” (Josh. 1:8). If you meditate on God’s Law, you are more likely to delight in it and obey it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you meditate on God’s Law, you are also more likely to be blessed by it</u>. The psalmist stated that he would both remember God’s Word and delight in His Law. “<em>I shall delight in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:16). Those who delight in God’s Law are more likely to be blessed. “Praise the LORD! Blessed is a person who fears the LORD, who greatly <em>delights in His commandments</em>.” (Ps. 112:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u><em><strong>Gimel (</strong></em><span dir="rtl">ג</span><em><strong>ּ):</strong></em> Obedience should also include prayer and listening to the Spirit</u>. To obey God in the right manner, you should read and meditate on His Scripture. You should then pray for the Holy Spirit to help you apply it. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>Deal generously with Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><u>Open my eyes</u>, that I may behold wonderful things from Your Law. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>I am a stranger on the earth; <u>do not hide</u> Your commandments from me. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>My soul is crushed with <u>longing</u> for Your ordinances at all times. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>You rebuke the arrogant, the cursed, who wander from Your commandments. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Take disgrace and contempt away from me, for I comply with Your testimonies. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Even though rulers sit and speak against me, Your servant <u>meditates</u> on Your statutes. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Your testimonies also are <u>my delight</u>; they are my advisers</em>.” (Ps. 119:17-24). “If God deals in strict justice with us, we all perish. We ought to spend our lives in his service; we shall find true life in keeping his word. Those that would see the wondrous things of God’s law and gospel, must beg him to give them understanding, by the light of his Spirit. Believers feel themselves strangers on earth; they fear missing their way, and losing comfort by erring from God’s commandments. Every sanctified soul hungers after the word of God, as food which there is no living without.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:17-24).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Through study and prayer, ask God to open your eyes to the wonders of Scripture<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Meditating and obeying God’s Scripture can help to open your eyes to spiritual things</u>. The psalmist cried out “<em>Open my eyes</em>” and “<em>do not hide Your commandments from me.</em>” (Ps. 119:18-19). God will do this when you meditate on His Scripture and pray for the Holy Spirit to reveal its meaning to you. “On that day those who are deaf will hear words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of those who are blind will see.” (Is. 29:18). “those who are blind receive sight and those who limp walk, those with leprosy are cleansed and those who are deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.” (Matt. 11:5). Are you praying over God’s Scripture?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Meditating and obeying God’s Scripture can help you to see worldly ways as foreign</u>. The psalmist stated, “<em>I am a stranger on the earth;</em>” (Ps. 119:19). When you meditate on God’s Scripture, worldly desires should also feel foreign to you. “All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen and welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that <em>they were strangers and exiles on the earth</em>.” (Heb. 11:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Meditating and obeying God’s Scripture can help to foster a desire for God</u>. The psalmist stated, “<em>My soul is crushed with longing for Your ordinances at all times.</em>” (Ps. 119:20). When you meditate on and obey God’s Scripture, you eventually come to see your intense need for Him, like cold water in the hot desert. “A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for You, God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?” (Ps. 42:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Disobedience to God’s Scripture frequently leads to His discipline</u>. For those who reject God’s Scripture, He views them as both arrogant and cursed, “<em><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>You rebuke the arrogant, the cursed, who wander from Your commandments.</em>” (Ps. 119:21). ‘“Cursed is anyone who does not fulfill the words of this Law by doing them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.”’ (Dt. 27:26). “and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the words of this covenant.”’’ (Jer. 11:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent of your sins when God’s Law exposes them</u>. The psalmist tried to obey. But he could not keep God’s Law because of his sinful nature. Thus, he pleaded for God to remove his sins. “<em>Take disgrace and contempt away from me, for I comply with Your testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:22). When David sinned, he also pleaded for God’s mercy and forgiveness because he knew the penalty for his actions under God’s Law. “Save me from all my wrongdoings; do not make me an object of reproach for the foolish.” (Ps. 39:8). “A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, God, according to Your faithfulness; according to the greatness of Your compassion, wipe out my wrongdoings … Hide Your face from my sins and wipe out all my guilty deeds.” (Ps. 51:1, 9). When you repent of your sins, Jesus is faithful to forgive you, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When others attack you, find peace in God’s Scripture</u>. Even though powerful people spoke against the psalmist, he found “<em>delight</em>” by “<em>meditating”</em> on God’s “<em>statutes</em>” and “<em>testimonies</em>.” (Ps. 119:23-24). When you meditate on God’s Scripture with all your heart, Jesus offers you His peace. “Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u><em><strong>Daleth (</strong></em><span dir="rtl">ד</span><em><strong>ּ):</strong></em> Scripture offers a path to revival when you meditate on it and apply it</u>. When you sin, God’s Law first convicts you. After repenting, meditating, and obeying God’s Word, He can then revive and renew you to serve Him. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>My soul clings to the dust; <u>revive me</u> according to Your word. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>I have told of my ways, and <u>You have answered me</u>; teach me Your statutes. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><u>Make me understand</u> the way of Your precepts, and I will <u>meditate</u> on Your wonders. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>My soul weeps because of grief; <u>strengthen me</u> according to Your word. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Remove the false way from me, and graciously grant me Your Law. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>I have chosen the faithful way; I have placed Your judgments before me. <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><u>I cling</u> to Your testimonies; <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, do not put me to shame! <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>I shall run the way of Your commandments, for You will enlarge my heart</em>.” (Ps. 119:25-32). “The Psalmist is in deep distress. He lies prostrate, crushed and unable to rise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-5.htm">Psalm 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>); but he can pray that God will revive him, and give him fresh strength and joy in life according to His promise.

<p>God’s Scripture offers you the path to spiritual revival<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Turn to God’s Word when you need spiritual revival</u>. In his time of despair, the psalmist pleaded, “<em>My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:25). Other psalmists also turned to God’s Word when they or God’s people needed spiritual revival. “You who have shown me many troubles and distresses will <em>revive me</em> again, and will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.” (Ps. 71:20). “Then we will not turn back from You; <em>revive us</em>, and we will call upon Your name.” (Ps. 80:18). “Will You not <em>revive us</em> again, so that Your people may rejoice in You?” (Ps. 85:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Spiritual revival requires a humble heart and a desire for God to guide and teach you</u>. To stay on the right path, the psalmist pleaded, “<em><strong><sup>.</sup></strong> …teach me Your statutes. Make me understand the way of Your precepts, and I will meditate on Your wonders.</em>” (Ps. 119:26b-27). Other psalmists also pleaded for God to teach them. “Make me know Your ways, LORD; <em>teach me Your paths</em>.” (Ps. 25:4). “<em>Teach me Your way</em>, LORD, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.” (Ps. 27:11). “<em>Teach me Your way</em>, LORD; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.” (Ps. 86:11). Thus, spiritual revival cannot happen without God. You must submit and let Him teach you. To fully apply His Word to your life, you should then “<em>meditate</em>” on it (Ps. 119:27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Word will also sustain you in your times of need when you depend upon Him</u>. The psalmist also pleaded, “<em><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>My soul weeps because of grief; strengthen me according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:28). Moses also reminded the Jews that God’s Word sustained them in the desert. “And He humbled you and let you go hungry, and fed you with the manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, in order to make you understand that man shall not live on bread alone, but <em>man shall live on everything that comes out of the mouth of the LORD</em>.” (Dt. 8:3). Jesus also stated that all need His Word to sustain them. “But He answered and said, “It is written: ‘<em>Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every Word that comes out of the mouth of God</em>.’” (Matt. 4:4; Lk. 4:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Revival requires that you allow God to purge worldly ways of thinking and allow His Law to become the standard for right and wrong in your life</u>. To stay on the right path, the psalmist pleaded, “<em><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Remove the false way from me, and graciously grant me Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:29). Moses warned against the dangers of moral relativism, where people decide right and wrong on their own. “You shall not do at all what we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes;” (Dt. 12:8). The book of Judges shows the chaos and sorrow that follows when mankind replaces the standards of God’s morality in His Law with their own definitions of right and wrong. “In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.” (Jdgs. 17:6; 21:25). Believers should also pray for God to remove their worldly ways of thinking.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Revival requires a commitment to obey God’s ways for it to be sustained</u>. The psalmist committed to following God’s “<em>faithful way</em>” by placing His “<em>judgments</em>” before him, “<em>clinging</em>” to His “<em>testimonies</em>”, and running in “<em>the way of Your commandments</em>.” (Ps. 119:30-32). David also committed to keeping God’s ways before him to stay on the right path. “For all His judgments were before me, and I did not put away His statutes from me.” (Ps. 18:22). Without commitment, your revival will likely fade over time.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Cling to God’s Scripture to maintain your revival</u>. Like the psalmist, it is important that you “<em>cling</em>” to God’s Word to maintain any revival (Ps. 119:31). “In the beginning of the section, he is clinging to the dust (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.25&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:25</a>); by the end he is clinging to God’s word. In the beginning he is laid low; now he is joyfully running with all his strength in the race God’s word sets before him.” (David Guzik on Psalm 119:31).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u><em><strong>He (</strong></em><span dir="rtl">ה</span><em><strong>):</strong></em> Revival includes being Spirit-led, openness, and delighting in God’s Scripture</u>. To keep yourself from backsliding after you renew yourself, you must pray for the Holy Spirit to open your eyes to your worldly ways and to find delight in God’s Scripture. “<strong><sup>33 </sup></strong><em><u>Teach me</u>, the way of Your statutes, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and I shall comply with it to the end. <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong><u>Give me understanding</u>, so that I may comply with Your Law and keep it with all my heart. <strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, <u>for I delight in it</u>. <strong><sup>36 </sup></strong><u>Incline my heart</u> to Your testimonies, and not to dishonest gain. <strong><sup>37 </sup></strong><u>Turn my eyes away</u> from looking at what is worthless, and revive me in Your ways. <strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>Establish Your word to Your servant as that which produces reverence for You. <strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>Take away my disgrace which I dread, for Your judgments are good. <strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>Behold, <u>I long for</u> Your precepts; revive me through Your righteousness</em>.” (Ps. 119:33-40). The Holy Spirit is critical to any revival. “Teach me thy statutes, not the mere words, but the way of applying them to myself. God, by his Spirit, gives a right understanding. But the Spirit of revelation in the word will not suffice, unless we have the Spirit of wisdom in the heart. God puts his Spirit within us, causing us to walk in his statutes.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:33-40).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Delight yourself in God’s Scripture, and He will give you your heart’s desires<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let the Holy Spirit teach you through prayer, study, and meditation on God’s Scripture</u>. The psalmist knew that he could not properly interpret and obey God’s Law on his own. Thus, he pleaded “<em>Teach me, the way of Your statutes,</em>” and “<em>give me understanding</em>.” (Ps. 119:34, 35). “Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes. This is the main prayer of the psalm - a prayer for spiritual enlightenment. It occurs eight times (vers. 12, 26, 33, 64, 68, 108, 124, and 135).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 119:34).<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> “The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.” (Is. 11:2). Jesus made clear that it is the Holy Spirit who teaches you through study and prayer how to apply God’s Scripture to your life. “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, <em>He will teach you all things</em>, and remind you of all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Delight yourself in God’s Scripture, and God will fulfill your desires</u>. The psalmist pleaded for God to “<em>make me walk in the path of Your commandments</em>” and “<em>incline my heart to Your testimonies</em>” because “<em>I delight in it.</em>” (Ps. 119:35-36). If you delight in following God’s Scripture, He will fulfill your heart’s desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). “You have given him his heart’s desire, and You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah” (Ps. 21:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus, the Word who became flesh, will revive you and make you righteous</u>. The psalmist also asked for God to “<em>revive</em>” him in God’s “<em>ways</em>” by “<em>turning</em>” his “<em>eyes away from looking at what is worthless.</em>” He “<em>longed</em>” to remove his reproach and develop “<em>reverence</em>” and “<em>revival</em>” <em>“through Your righteousness</em>.” (Ps. 119:37-40). Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). When you repent and submit to Him, He will revive you by making you righteous. “But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,” (Ro. 4:5).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u><strong>Vav (</strong><span dir="rtl">ו</span><strong>):</strong> Meditate on God’s Scripture to find the path to salvation and freedom</u>. The greatest blessings that come from meditating on and obeying God’s Scripture is your eternal salvation and freedom. “<strong><sup>41 </sup></strong><em>May Your favor also come to me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Your <u>salvation</u> according to Your word; <strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>so that I will have an answer for one who taunts me, for I trust in Your word. <strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I wait for Your judgments. <strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>So I will keep Your Law continually, forever and ever. <strong><sup>45 </sup></strong>And <u>I will walk at liberty</u>, for I <u>seek</u> Your precepts. <strong><sup>46 </sup></strong><u>I will also speak</u> of Your testimonies before kings and shall not be ashamed. <strong><sup>47 </sup></strong>I will <u>delight</u> in Your commandments, which I love. <strong><sup>48 </sup></strong>And I shall lift up my hands to Your commandments, which <u>I love</u>; and <u>I will meditate</u> on Your statutes</em>.” (Ps. 119:41-48). “God’s mercies and salvation, as revealed in His Word, provide hope of forgiveness for the past and security in a righteous course for the future.” (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Ps. 119:41-48).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>

<p>God’s Scripture provides the path to salvation and freedom through Jesus<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith in the promises in Jesus’ Word leads to your eternal salvation</u>. The psalmist celebrated “<em>Your salvation according to Your word;</em>” (Ps. 119:41). Many Jews today interpret this as “deliverance”. But Jesus gave new meaning to the promises of salvation found throughout the psalms. “For <em>You will not abandon my soul to Sheol</em>; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “<em>To rescue their soul from death</em> and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:19-20). “But <em>God will redeem my soul</em> from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For <em>You have saved my soul from death</em>, indeed my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living.” (Ps. 56:13). “God is to us a <em>God of salvation</em>; and to GOD the Lord belong ways of escape from death.” (Ps. 68:20). “Help us, <em>God of our salvation</em>, for the glory of Your name; and save us and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.” (Ps. 79:9). “<em>You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol</em>.” (Ps. 86:13). “<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will … show him My salvation</em>.’” (Ps. 91:16). “ . . . . <em>proclaim the good news of His salvation.</em>” (Ps. 96:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Salvation is possible through Jesus’ atoning death on the cross</u>. Salvation was a mystery in Old Testament times (E.g., Ps. 6:5; Is. 38:18). But you can trust in Jesus’ Word for your eternal salvation: “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;” (Ro. 10:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus’ mercy and grace inspire your obedience</u>. In response to God’s offer of salvation, the psalmist declared, “<em><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>So I will keep Your Law continually, forever and ever.</em>” (Ps. 119:44). Although some may find the subject of obedience to be redundant, each time it appears within Psalm 119 it assumes a different context. If an afterlife did not exist, the psalmist could not offer to keep God’s Law “<em>forever and ever.</em>” (Ps. 119:44). Thus, this was a response of gratitude for what God had done. In other psalms, the psalmists also praised God for His salvation: “But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; <em>my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation</em>.” (Ps. 13:5). Jesus also deserves your praise. You can show your gratitude by making your life a living sacrifice to Him (Ro. 12:1). You can also show your gratitude through your voluntary obedience to His Law.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ mercy and grace also includes freedom from bondage</u>. The psalmist further declared that he would “<em>walk at liberty, for I seek Your precepts.</em>” (Ps. 119:45). When Jesus becomes your Lord and you obey Him out of love, He also offers you freedom from bondage to sin, “and you will know the truth, and <em>the truth will set you free</em>.” (Jo. 8:32). “and after being freed from sin, <em>you became slaves to righteousness</em>.” (Ro. 6:18). “For the law of the Spirit of life in <em>Christ Jesus has set you free</em> from the law of sin and of death.” (Ro. 8:2). “<em>It was for freedom that Christ set us free</em>; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Gal. 5:1). “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, <em>there is freedom</em>.” (2 Cor. 3:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus’ mercy and grace inspire you to share your testimony with others</u>. In response to God’s offer of salvation, the psalmist stated that “<em>I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings and shall not be ashamed.</em>” (Ps. 119:46). “Come and hear, all who fear God, and <em>I will tell of what He has done for my soul</em>.” (Ps. 66:16). “<em>My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness and of Your salvation</em> all day long; for I do not know the art of writing.” (Ps. 71:15). “Sing to the LORD, bless His name; <em>proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day</em>.” (Ps. 96:2). You too can share the good news with others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Respond to Jesus’ mercy and grace by showing your love for Him</u>. In response to God’s promise of salvation, the psalmist stated that he would “<em>delight in Your commandments, which I love. And I shall lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love; and I will meditate on Your statutes.”</em> (Ps. 119:47-48). The psalmist repeatedly stated that he would either delight in or love God’s Scripture (Ps. 119:16, 97, 113, 119, 127, 140, 159). Here, he made this declaration as a reflection of His appreciation for his salvation.</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Zayin (</strong><span dir="rtl">ז</span><strong>):</strong> Remember God’s Scripture to find hope, renewal, and joy</u>. Three times, the psalmist encouraged believers to “remember” God’s Scripture. Even during a trial, His promises offer you hope, renewal, and joy. “<strong><sup>49 </sup></strong><em><u>Remember</u> the word to Your servant, in which You have made me <u>hope</u>. <strong><sup>50 </sup></strong>This is my comfort in my misery, that Your word has <u>revived me</u>. <strong><sup>51 </sup></strong>The arrogant utterly deride me, yet I do not turn aside from Your Law. <strong><sup>52 </sup></strong>I have <u>remembered</u> Your judgments from of old, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and comfort myself. <strong><sup>53 </sup></strong>Burning indignation has seized me because of the wicked, who abandon Your Law. <strong><sup>54 </sup></strong>Your statutes are <u>my songs</u> in the house of my pilgrimage. <strong><sup>55 </sup></strong><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I <u>remember</u> Your name in the night, and keep Your Law. <strong><sup>56 </sup></strong>This has become mine, that I comply with Your precepts</em>.” (Ps. 119:49-56). “This is his comfort in his dejected condition, that God’s promissory declaration has quickened him and proved its reviving power in his case.” (Keil and Derlitzsch Bible Commentary on the Old Testament, Ps. 119:49-56).<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Place your hope in Jesus’ promises of salvation</u>. The psalmist gave thanks that God’s “<em>word</em>” had given him <em>“hope.</em>” (Ps. 119:49). “Again the psalmist understood that his trust and <strong>hope</strong> in God’s word should not be credited to his own spiritual greatness or genius. It came because God worked in him to <strong>hope</strong> in His word.” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:49).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? <em>My hope is in You</em>.” (Ps. 39:7). “For <em>You are my hope;</em> Lord GOD, You are my confidence from my youth.” (Ps. 71:5). “For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and <em>a hope</em>.”’ (Jer. 29:11). “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to <em>a living hope</em> through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,” (1 Pet. 1:3). “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a <em>hope</em> both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). “For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and <em>the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope</em>.” (Ro. 15:4).</p></li>

<p>Turn to God’s Word to find hope during any trial<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let the hope of your salvation revive you and comfort you during a trial</u>. The psalmist was under attack. “<em>The arrogant utterly deride me.</em>” (Ps. 119:51). But the hope of God’s promises revived him and gave him comfort. “<strong><sup>50 </sup></strong><em>This is my comfort</em> in my misery, that <em>Your word has revived me.</em>” (Ps. 119:50). For emphasis, the psalmist repeated this. “I am exceedingly afflicted; <em>revive me, LORD, according to Your word</em>.” (Ps. 119:107). Job also found comfort in the promises of God’s Word, even before the Old Testament existed, “But it is still my comfort, and I rejoice in unsparing pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.” (Job 6:10). You too can find comfort in God’s Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The hope of God’s promises can also give your perseverance</u>. Because of the hope he found in God’s Word, the psalmist had the power to persevere in the face of his trials. “<em>…yet I do not turn aside from Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:51). “Many are my persecutors and my enemies, <em>yet I do not turn aside from Your testimonies</em>.” (Ps. 119:157). “Rulers persecute me without cause, <em>but my heart stands in awe of Your words</em>.” (Ps. 119:161). With the hope of God’s Word, you can also find joy during your trials (Jam. 1:2-6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Memorize God’s Word to allow the Holy Spirit to help you remember it during a trial</u>. The psalmist found comfort by “remembering” the promises of God’s Word, “<em><strong><sup>52 </sup></strong>I have remembered Your judgments from of old, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and comfort myself.</em>” (Ps. 119:52). In this one section, the psalmist repeated the Word “remember” three times for emphasis (Ps. 119:49, 52, 55). When you memorize God’s Word, the Holy Spirit can help you to remember it and either find comfort or guidance during your times of need. “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and <em>remind you of all that I said to you</em>.” (Jo. 14:26).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you memorize God’s Law, the sins of the world will also burden you</u>. The psalmist stated that he felt “<em>burning indignation</em>” at “<em>the wicked, who abandon Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:53, 158). Moses, Ezra, and Nehemiah all burned with anger when the Jews rejected God’s Law (Ex. 32:19; Ezra 9:3; Neh. 13:25). When you memorize and meditate on God’s Law, you will also become His salt and light in the world (Matt. 5:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The hope of God’s Word also offers you joy during your trials</u>. Despite suffering persecution, the psalmist stated that God’s Word would allow him to sing for joy. “<em><strong><sup>54 </sup></strong>Your statutes are my songs . . .</em>” (Ps. 119:54). “<em>rejoicing in hope</em>, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,” (Ro. 12:12). “God’s statutes form the theme of his songs; they calm his mind and refresh his spirit in this transitory life of trial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm">1 Chronicles 29:15</a>), as songs beguile the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>), or cheer the traveller on his journey.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 119:54).<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Heth/ Chet (</strong><span dir="rtl">ח</span><strong>):</strong> Let God’s promises of salvation inspire you to obey, be content, be grateful, and to desire to learn all you can from Him</u>. When you are grateful for God’s Scripture, you are more likely to be content and seek out all that you can learn from Him. “<strong><sup>57 </sup></strong><em><u>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is my portion</u>; I have promised to keep Your words. <strong><sup>58 </sup></strong>I sought Your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to Your word. <strong><sup>59 </sup></strong>I considered my ways and turned my feet to Your testimonies. <strong><sup>60 </sup></strong><u>I hurried and did not delay</u> to keep Your commandments. <strong><sup>61 </sup></strong>The snares of the wicked have surrounded me, but <u>I have not forgotten</u> Your Law. <strong><sup>62 </sup></strong>At midnight I will rise to <u>give thanks</u> to You because of Your righteous judgments. <strong><sup>63 </sup></strong>I am a companion to all those who fear You, and to those who keep Your precepts. <strong><sup>64 </sup></strong>The earth is full of Your goodness, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; <u>teach me</u> Your statutes</em>.” (Ps. 119:57-64). “True believers take the Lord for the portion of their inheritance, and nothing less will satisfy them. The psalmist prayed with his whole heart, knowing how to value the blessing he prayed for: he desired the mercy promised, and depended on the promise for it. He turned from by-paths, and returned to God’s testimonies. He delayed not. It behoves sinners to hasten to escape; and the believer will be equally in haste to glorify God.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:57-64).<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>There is no substitute to the satisfaction of studying and living out God’s Word</u>. Because God was all the psalmist needed, he vowed to follow God’s Word in all aspects of his life. “<strong><sup>57 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is my portion; I have promised to keep Your words.</em>” (Ps. 119:57). Other Bible authors realized that their relationship with God, made possible through the Word and prayer, was all that they needed. “<em>The LORD is the portion of my inheritance</em> and my cup; You support my lot.” (Ps. 16:5). “My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and <em>my portion forever</em>.” (Ps. 73:26). “I cried out to You, LORD; I said, ‘You are my refuge, <em>My portion</em> in the land of the living.”’ (Ps. 142:5). ‘“<em>The LORD is my portion</em>,’ says my soul, ‘Therefore I wait for Him.”’ (Lam. 3:24). “The <em>Portion of Jacob</em> is not like these; for He is the Maker of everything, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; the LORD of armies is His name.” (Jer. 10:6).</p></li>

<li><p><u>In the face of evil, let God’s grace also prompt you to obey Him with all your heart</u>. In response to God’s “<em>grace</em>” “<em>according to Your word</em>” and in response to the “<em>snares of the wicked</em>”, the psalmist committed to seeking God “<em>favor”</em> “<em>with all my heart,</em>” turning to His “<em>testimonies</em>”, “<em>hurrying</em>” without delay “<em>to keep Your commandments</em>”, and remembering “<em>Your Law</em>.” (Ps. 119:58-61). When you submit to God and take refuge in His Word, He offers you refuge. “Keep me as the apple of the eye; <em>hide me in the shadow of Your wings</em>.” (Ps. 17:8). “A Mikhtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, <em>for my soul takes refuge in You</em>; and <em>in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge</em> until destruction passes by.” (Ps. 57:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s mercy and grace also prompt you to examine your ways</u>. Possibly because he had been caught in the “<em>snares of the wicked</em>” (Ps. 119:61), the psalmist was forced to <em>considered my ways</em>.” (Ps. 119:59). When you are freed from bondage to sin, you should always “consider your ways” so that you do not return to your old ways of thinking. “<em>Let’s examine and search out our ways</em>, and let’s return to the LORD.” (Lam. 3:40). “<em>Test yourselves</em> to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Cor. 13:5). You should also invite God to test your heart to expose worldly ways of thinking. “<em>Search me, God</em>, and know my heart; <em>put me to the test</em> and know my anxious thoughts;” (Ps. 139:23). Are you examining yourself and inviting His testing?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Respond to Jesus’ mercy and grace with sincere gratitude</u>. The psalmist stated that he would rise and give sincere thanks for his salvation and freedom. “<em>At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You</em>.” (Ps. 119:62). He also gave thanks because “<em>The earth is full of Your goodness,</em>” (Ps. 119:64). “At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee . . . The idea is, that his mind was so full of the subject that he would take this unusual time to give vent to his feelings. The mind may be so full of love to the law - the word - of God, that nothing will satisfy it but such unusual acts of devotion.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 119:62).<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>  This sincere gratitude included a desire to learn more from God (Ps. 119:64).</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-trust-in-gods-scripture-to-grow-your-faith-and-let-it-become-your-greatest-treasure.-ps.-11965-96."><strong>4. <u>Faith: Trust in God’s Scripture to Grow Your Faith, and Let it Become Your</u> <u>Greatest Treasure</u>. Ps. 119:65-96.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u><strong>Teth (</strong><span dir="rtl">ט</span><strong>):</strong> Trust in God’s Scripture should cause you to have faith in it and treasure it</u>. When you believe in God’s Scripture and desire to learn all you can from it, it will eventually become your greatest treasure. “<strong><sup>65 </sup></strong><em>You have treated Your servant well, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your word. <strong><sup>66 </sup></strong>Teach me good discernment and knowledge, for <u>I believe</u> in Your commandments. <strong><sup>67 </sup></strong>Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Your word. <strong><sup>68 </sup></strong>You are good and You do good; teach me Your statutes. <strong><sup>69 </sup></strong>The arrogant have forged a lie against me; with all my heart I will comply with Your precepts. <strong><sup>70 </sup></strong>Their heart is insensitive, like fat, but I delight in Your Law. <strong><sup>71 </sup></strong>It is good for me that I was afflicted, so that I may learn Your statutes. <strong><sup>72 </sup></strong>The Law of Your mouth is <u>better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces</u></em>.” (Ps. 119:65-72). Faith allowed him to see God’s hand during his trials. “Acknowledging that the LORD has treated him well, the psalmist prays for knowledge and understanding of the word that <em>he believes</em> in and obeys even though arrogant people lie about him, concluding that the affliction he endured forced him to learn more of God’s ways (119:65-72).” (Allen Ross on Ps. 119:65-72).<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith in God’s Word allows you to see God’s grace in your life and be grateful for it</u>. The psalmist was under ongoing attacks (Ps. 119:69). But, “<em>according to Your word</em>”, he had faith that God had “<em>treated Your servant well.</em>” (Ps. 119:65). When his soul cleaved to dust, God’s Word revived him (Ps. 119:25). Thus, the psalmist had the faith and trust to declare that God had, through His grace, treated him well. “However God has dealt with us, he has dealt with us better than we deserve; and all in love, and for our good.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:65-72).<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> “This section begins with a note of <em>gratitude</em>. The psalmist finds himself thankful for God’s good dealing toward him, and that blessings have come <strong>according to</strong> His <strong>word</strong> . . . Think of all the ways God has dealt well with us. He chose us, He called us, He drew us to Himself. He rescued us, He declared us righteous, He forgave us, He put His Spirit within us, He adopted us into His family. He loves us, He makes us kings and priests and co-workers with Him, and He rewards all our work for Him.” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:65) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your trust and love for Jesus also motivate your obedience</u>. The psalmist did not just obey because he was obligated to do so. Instead, he declared, “<em>I believe in Your commandments</em>.” (Ps. 119:66). Because he believed, he urged God to “<em>Teach me good discernment and knowledge</em>.” (Ps. 119:66). Your salvation is not based on works. It is instead based upon your faith. “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and <em>believe in your heart</em> that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;” (Ro. 10:9). Your faith and love should then be the inspiration for your obedience. “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.”  (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith and trust in God’s promise that His discipline is a sign of His love</u>. The psalmist was the victim of slander. “<em>The arrogant have forged a lie against me</em>…” (Ps. 119:69). But the psalmist still recognized that God had disciplined him. “<em>Before I was afflicted I went astray,</em>” (Ps. 119:67). Thus, he praised God for using His discipline to prompt him to learn God’s Law better. “<em>It is good for me that I was afflicted, so that I may learn Your statutes</em>.” (Ps. 119:71). Other psalmists also saw God’s discipline as a blessing when it prompted believers to turn to God’s Law and trust in and obey it. “Blessed is the man whom You discipline, LORD, and whom You teach from Your Law,” (Ps. 94:12). “So you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5; Heb. 12:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust that God has laid out in Scripture what is best for you</u>. The psalmist pleaded with God to “<em>teach me Your statutes</em>” because he realized that God is “<em>good</em>” and does “<em>good</em>”. (Ps. 119:68). “For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting and His faithfulness is to all generations.” (Ps. 105:5). Jesus also urged believers to turn to the Word, learn it, and obey it to realize the blessings He has for you. “And He said to him, ‘Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”’ (Matt. 19:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God and not your own understanding</u>. In the face of a trial, believers frequently face doubt. But, like the psalmist, you must have faith in and trust God’s Word. The enemy will try to force you to instead rely upon your own understanding: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5; 28:26; Ps. 62:8). “Trust in the LORD forever, for in GOD the LORD, we have an everlasting Rock.” (Is. 26:4). When you are facing a doubt in yourself, have faith in God’s Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Disobedience stems from a lack of faith and a hardened heart</u>. In reference to his slanderers (Ps. 119:69), the psalmist lamented, “<em>Their heart is insensitive, like fat,…</em>” (Ps. 119:70). “They have closed their <em>unfeeling hearts,</em> with their mouths they speak proudly.” (Ps. 17:10). Their disobedience had led them to develop hardened hearts and to become spiritually blind. “Make the hearts of this people insensitive, their ears dull, and their eyes blind, so that they will not see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and return and be healed.” (Is. 6:10; Matt. 13:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God and you will see Scripture as your greatest treasure</u>. Because he believed in Scripture, the psalmist found “<em>delight in Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:69). He further knew that it was “<em>good for me</em>” through his affliction to “<em>learn Your statutes.</em>” (Ps. 119:71). Because of the encouragement and wisdom found in God’s Law, he saw it as being greater than any worldly treasure. “<em>The Law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces</em>.” (Ps. 119:72). For emphasis, he later repeated this claim. “Therefore I love Your commandments above gold, yes, above pure gold.” (Ps. 119:127). “They [the judgments of the LORD] are more desirable than gold, yes, than much pure gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.” (Ps. 19:10). With faith, you will learn that Jesus’ Word is your greatest treasure. “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44).</p></li>

<p>The wisdom in God’s Law is worth more than any worldly treasure.<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<li><p><u><strong>Yodh (</strong><span dir="rtl">י</span><strong>):</strong> Trust and meditate on Scripture to find patience, comfort, and your calling</u>. When you have faith in God’s Scripture and understand that He created you to serve Him, you are more likely to desire to learn from it, be patient for God’s timing, and find comfort in it. “<strong><sup>73 </sup></strong><em>Your hands made me and fashioned me; give <u>me understanding</u>, so that <u>I may learn</u> Your commandments. <strong><sup>74 </sup></strong>May those who fear You see me and be glad, because <u>I wait</u> for Your word. <strong><sup>75 </sup></strong><u>I know</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that Your judgments are righteous, and that You have afflicted me in faithfulness. <strong><sup>76 </sup></strong>May <u>Your favor comfort me</u>, according to Your word to Your servant. <strong><sup>77 </sup></strong>May <u>Your compassion come</u> to me so that I may live, for Your Law is <u>my delight</u>. <strong><sup>78 </sup></strong>May the arrogant be put to shame, because they lead me astray with a lie; but I shall <u>meditate</u> on Your precepts. <strong><sup>79 </sup></strong>May those who fear You turn to me, and those who know Your testimonies. <strong><sup>80 </sup></strong>May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, so that I will not be ashamed</em>.” (Ps. 119:73-80). “God made us to serve him, and enjoy him; but by sin we have made ourselves unfit to serve him, and to enjoy him. We ought, therefore, continually to beseech him, by his Holy Spirit, to give us understanding.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:73-80).<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God’s Word to reveal His plans for you</u>. Because the psalmist had the faith to believe, “<strong><sup>73 </sup></strong><em>Your hands made me and fashioned</em> me,” he pleaded “<em>give me understanding, so that I may learn Your commandments</em>.” (Ps. 119:73). God created each person out of love. “For You created my innermost parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb.” (Ps. 139:13). “This is what the LORD says, He who is your Redeemer, and the <em>one who formed you from the womb</em>:..,”’ (Is. 44:24). When you have faith, it is also easier to look to Scripture and see that God created you for a purpose to serve Him. “<em>The LORD will accomplish what concerns me</em>; Your faithfulness, LORD, is everlasting; do not abandon the works of Your hands.” (Ps. 138:8). With faith and obedience, His plans for you will also be fulfilled. “<em>The yod stanza represents the small Hebrew letter Jesus referred to as a “jot” in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+5.18&amp;t=NKJV">Matthew 5:18</a>: Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.</em>” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:73-80).<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your faith and trust in God’s Word by being patient for His timing</u>. The psalmist declared, “<em>I wait for Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:74). When you believe God’s Word and meditate on His promises, you are more likely to develop the faith to be patient and wait for His timing. “Wait for the LORD; be strong and let your heart take courage; yes, wait for the LORD.” (Ps. 27:14). “Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are eliminated, you will see it.” (Ps. 37:34). “I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and I wait for His word.” (Ps. 130:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your faith by trusting God’s Scripture to know that God’s plan is the right plan</u>. The psalmist believed that God had “<em>afflicted</em>” him. But he still had the faith to proclaim “<em>I know, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that Your judgments are righteous</em>…” (Ps. 119:75). For emphasis, he later repeated this claim. “You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness ...” (Ps. 119:138). Even with his intense suffering, Job also had faith to trust God to know what was best for him (Job 1:21). During your trials, you can also trust God’s Scripture to guide you and restore you. “The Law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.” (Ps. 19:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to God’s Scripture to find comfort</u>. Because God’s “<em>Law</em>” was the psalmist’s “<em>delight</em>,” he prayed for God “<em>favor</em>” to “<em>comfort</em>” him “<em>according to Your word</em>”. In the face of a trial, he also asked for God’s “<em>compassion</em>” to allow him to “<em>live</em>.” (Ps. 119:76-77). During a trial, you can also turn to Scripture to find comfort (2 Cor. 1:3-4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to Scripture to find comfort in God’s promises to be just and fair with you</u>. In the face of those who “<em>lead</em> [him] <em>astray with a lie</em>,” the psalmist vowed to “<em>meditate on</em> [God’s] <em>precepts.</em>” (Ps. 119:78.) He asked God to avenge him by putting the “<em>arrogant</em>” “<em>to shame</em>.” (Ps. 119:78.) When others harm you, you can turn to Scripture to trust God to set right the wrongs against you in His timing (Lev. 19:18; Dt. 32:35; Ro<em>.</em> 12:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith in God’s promises to purify you after you sin</u>. After being led astray (Ps. 119:78), the psalmist prayed for God’s Word to purify him. “<em>May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, so that I will not be ashamed</em>.” (Ps. 119:80). With faith in Jesus’ atoning sacrifice, His Word will also purify you and restore you (Jo. 15:3; Eph. 5:26).</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Kaph (</strong><span dir="rtl">כ</span><strong>ּ):</strong> Trust in God’s Scripture allows Him to strengthen you and revive you</u>. When you have faith in God’s Scripture and study it, He can strengthen you and revive you during your trials. “<strong><sup>81 </sup></strong><em>My soul languishes for Your <u>salvation</u>; <u>I wait</u> for Your word. <strong><sup>82 </sup></strong>My eyes fail with <u>longing</u> for Your word, while I say, ‘When will You comfort me?’ <strong><sup>83 </sup></strong>Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget Your statutes. <strong><sup>84 </sup></strong>How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me? <strong><sup>85 </sup></strong>The arrogant have dug pits for me, people who are not in accord with Your Law. <strong><sup>86 </sup></strong>All Your commandments are faithful; they have persecuted me with a lie; <u>help me</u>! <strong><sup>87 </sup></strong>They almost destroyed me on earth, but as for me, I did not abandon Your precepts. <strong><sup>88 </sup></strong><u>Revive me</u> according to Your faithfulness, so that I may keep the testimony of Your mouth</em>.” (Ps. 119:81-88). “The new division of the psalm, which begins here, is indicated by the Hebrew letter Kaph (<span dir="rtl">כ</span> k), equivalent to ‘k’ or ‘c’ (hard). The word here rendered ‘fainteth’ is the same that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a> is translated ‘faileth’: ‘My flesh and my heart faileth.’ The idea is, that his strength gave way; he had such an intense desire for salvation that he became weak and powerless. Any strong emotion may thus prostrate us; and the love of God - the desire of his favor - the longing for heaven - may be so intense as to produce this result. I hope in thy word - I trust in thy promises, and am sustained. My powers, which would otherwise wholly fail, are upheld by thy word, and on that I rely. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-74.htm">Psalm 119:74</a>.” (Albert Barnes Notes on the Bible, Ps. 119:81-88).<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God’s Scripture to strengthen you when you feel weakness or despair</u>. Because of his intense trials, the psalmist was filled with sorrow. “<em>My soul languishes. . . My eyes fail  . . . ‘When will You comfort me?’ . . . I have become like a wineskin in the smoke,</em>” (Ps. 119:81-83). But instead of feeling hopeless, he was filled with <em>“longing” </em>for God’s <em>“salvation</em>” and His “<em>word</em>.” (Ps. 119:81-82). With faith, God’s Word can strengthen you. “My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” (Ps. 73:26). “My soul longed and even yearned for the courtyards of the LORD; My heart and my flesh sing for joy to the living God.” (Ps. 84:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God’s Scripture to find peace when others attack you</u>. Instead of taking vengeance into his own hands, the psalmist turned to God to right the wrongs against him. You can also be authentic with your feelings when you pray to God. “<em><strong><sup>84 </sup></strong>How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment on those who persecute me?</em>” (Ps. 119:84). Jesus will one day come to bring judgment and right every wrong, “and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who live on the earth?”’ (Rev. 6:10). But Jesus has delayed judgment to give everyone the chance to repent (2 Pet. 3:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust in God’s Scripture when you need help</u>. The psalmist stated that the “<em>The arrogant”,</em> who rejected God’s “<em>Law,</em>” had “<em>dug pits</em>” for him<em>.</em> (Ps. 119:85). Because he had had the faith to know that God’s “<em>commandments are faithful</em>,” he cried out “<em>help me!</em>” in the face of those who “<em>persecuted</em>” him (Ps. 119:86). The psalmists showed that they could trust God by crying out for help. “Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me; nor let those who hate me for no reason wink maliciously.” (Ps. 35:19). “Help me, LORD my God; save me according to Your mercy.” (Ps. 109:26).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust God’s Scripture to revive you to allow you to serve Him</u>. The psalmist cried out that his enemies had “<em>almost destroyed</em>” him (Ps. 119:87). But because he had “<em>not abandon</em> [God’s] <em>precepts</em>,” he pleaded with God, “<em>Revive me according to Your faithfulness ..</em>.” (Ps. 119:87-88). When you have faith in God’s Scripture, He can also revive you. “…<em>Your word has revived me.</em>” (Ps. 119:50). “… <em>revive me, LORD, according to Your word</em>.” (Ps. 119:107). But the psalmist sought to be revived not for his glory but instead to serve God. “If he is to continue glorifying God by the observance of His law, God must preserve his life, and free it from the hindrances which impede its devotion to His service.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 119:88).<a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Lamedh (</strong><span dir="rtl">ל</span><strong>):</strong> Trust and remember God’s Scripture to develop faith in His eternal promises and to find delight in Him</u>. When you have faith in God’s Scripture, you are more likely to be Kingdom-minded and find delight in Him. “<strong><sup>89 </sup></strong><em><u>Forever</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Your word stands in <u>heaven</u>. <strong><sup>90 </sup></strong>Your faithfulness continues throughout <u>generations</u>; You established the earth, and it stands. <strong><sup>91 </sup></strong>They stand this day by Your ordinances, for all things are Your servants. <strong><sup>92 </sup></strong>If Your Law had not been <u>my delight</u>, then I would have perished in my misery. <strong><sup>93 </sup></strong>I will <u>never forget</u> Your precepts, for by them You have <u>revived me</u>. <strong><sup>94 </sup></strong>I am Yours, <u>save me</u>; for I have sought Your precepts. <strong><sup>95 </sup></strong>The wicked wait for me to destroy me; I <u>will</u> <u>diligently</u> consider Your testimonies. <strong><sup>96 </sup></strong>I have seen a limit to all perfection; Your commandment is exceedingly broad</em>.” (Ps. 119:89-96). “This commences a new division of the psalm, indicated by the Hebrew letter Lamed (<span dir="rtl">ל</span> l), or "l." . . . The meaning here is, that the word - the law - the promise - of God was made firm, established, stable, in heaven; and would be so forever and ever. What God had ordained as law would always remain law; what he had affirmed would always remain true; what he had promised would be sure forever.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 119:89-96).<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust in God’s eternal Word</u>. The psalmist stated, “<strong><sup>89 </sup></strong><em>Forever, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Your word stands in heaven.</em>” (Ps. 119:89). God’s Word will last forever. “After tossing about on a sea of trouble the Psalmist here leaps to shore and stands upon a rock. Jehovah’s word is not fickle nor uncertain; it is settled, determined, fixed, sure, immovable. Man’s teachings change so often that there is never time for them to be settled; but the Lord’s word is from of old the same, and will remain unchanged eternally.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:89).<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.” (Is. 40:8). “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.” (Matt. 24:35; Mk. 13:31; Lk. 21:33). ‘“But the Word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word which was preached to you.” (1 Pet. 1:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in God’s faithfulness as promised in His Word</u>. The psalmist celebrated God’s faithfulness. “<em>Your faithfulness continues throughout generations</em>;…” (Ps. 119:90). Other psalmists proclaimed that God is faithful to keep His Word. “For the word of the LORD is right, and all His work is done in faithfulness.” (Ps. 33:4). “Your mercy, LORD, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.” (Ps. 36:5). “I will sing of the graciousness of the LORD forever; to all generations I will make Your faithfulness known with my mouth.” (Ps. 89:1). “God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.” (1 Thess. 5:24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s creation obeys His Word to ensure that His Word is fulfilled</u>. All creation will ensure that His promises are fulfilled. “They stand this day by Your ordinances, for all things are Your servants.” (Ps. 119:91). “Heaven and earth continue to observe the ordinances given them by God at the first.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 119:91).<a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust God and you will find comfort in His faithfulness</u>. Because the psalmist trusted in God’s Law, he felt peace during his trials. “<em>If Your Law had not been my delight, then I would have perished in my misery.</em>” (Ps. 119:92). His remembrance of God’s precepts also revived him (Ps. 119:93). “This is my comfort in my misery, that Your word has revived me.” (Ps. 119:50). He strengthens those who trust in Him (Is. 49:21-31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are attacked, keep your focus on God’s Word</u>. The psalmist cried out “<em>save me</em>” when others sought to destroy him (Ps. 119:94-95). Because he trusted in God’s Word for deliverance, he could keep his focus on God’s “<em>precepts</em>” and “<em>testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:94-95). “I cried to You; save me and I shall keep Your testimonies.” (Ps. 119:146). If you are seeking to do God’s will, you can leave the rest to Him.</p></li>

It is my <u>meditation</u> all the day. <strong><sup>98 </sup></strong>Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever mine. <strong><sup>99 </sup></strong>I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my <u>meditation</u>. <strong><sup>100 </sup></strong>I understand more than those who are old, because I have complied with Your precepts. <strong><sup>101 </sup></strong>I have restrained my feet from every evil way, so that I may keep Your word. <strong><sup>102 </sup></strong>I have not turned aside from Your judgments, for You Yourself have taught me. <strong><sup>103 </sup></strong><u>How sweet are Your words</u> to my taste! Yes, <u>sweeter than honey</u> to my mouth! <strong><sup>104 </sup></strong>From Your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way</em>.” (Ps. 119:97-104). “We not only reverence but love the law, we obey it out of love, and even when it chides us for disobedience we love it none the less. The law is God's law, and therefore it is our love. We love it for its holiness, and pine to be holy; we love it for its wisdom, and study to be wise; we love it for its perfection, and long to be perfect. Those who know the power of the gospel perceive an infinite loveliness in the law as they see it fulfilled and embodied in Christ Jesus.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:97-104).<a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> </p></li>
<li><p><u>If you love God’s Law and obey it out of devotion, God will bless you</u>. After starting off by proclaiming a blessing for those “<em>who walk in the Law of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>,” (Ps. 119:1), the psalmist returns to his premise by declaring, “<em>How I love Your Law!</em>” The Law is further the subject of his “<em>meditation all the day.</em>” (Ps. 119:97). In modern commentaries, many will extoll the need to love God’s “Word” generally and not His “Law” or the Ten Commandments in specific. But the very first psalm starts with a similar declaration. “<em>But his delight is in the Law of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and on His Law he meditates day and night</em>.”  (Ps. 1:2). Jesus’ greatest condemnations were therefore directed at religious leaders who turned the Law into a set of legalistic rituals  (e.g., Matt. 23:24).  We must be careful not to do the same in studying the Law.  Jesus came to fulfill the Law  (Matt. 5:17).  By faith in His atoning death, we are no longer judged under the Law as a condition of our salvation (Ro. 7:6; 8:3; Gal. 5:18).  But this does not make the Law irrelevant.</p></li>

<p>God’s Law is filled with wisdom that can bless your life when you follow it<a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seven reasons God’s Law remains relevant today</u>.  For several reasons, the study of God’s Law remains important.  <u>First</u>, through the study of the Law, your sins become known to you (Ro. 3:20; 7:7).  Once you then repent of them, your Covenant relationship can be renewed.  If the Law did not apply, there would be no sins for God to reveal to you.  And if you believe that you are without sin, the truth is not within you (1 Jo. 1:8).  <u>Second</u>, Jesus says that if you love Him, you will keep His “Commandments” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6; Matt. 19:17).  He again is the great “I AM” who gave Moses the Ten Commandments  (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14).  But he came to correct people’s motives in following the Ten Commandments.  He wants your obedience to be motivated by love and not obligation.  He therefore summarized the Ten Commandments as something that comes naturally once a person loves the Lord and his or her neighbor  (Matt. 22:35-38; Lk. 10:27; Dt. 6:5).  Moses taught us to live obediently as it is written.  Jesus taught us to love obediently as it is written.  Whether we keep the Ten Commandments out of love (and not obligation) is also the test regarding whether we really “know” Jesus:  “By this we know that we have come to <em>know</em> Him, if we keep His commandments.”  (1 Jo. 2:3).  Some will come to Jesus boasting of their works or compliance with the Law.  Yet, if their works or their compliance with the Law was not motivated by a love for Him, He may respond “I never <em>knew</em> you.”  (Matt. 7:23).  <u>Third</u>, if you obey the Law for the right reasons, you become slaves to righteousness.  If you do not obey the Law, you become a slave to sin (Ro. 6:12, 16; Jo. 8:34).  <u>Fourth</u>, believers are commanded to be holy (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44).  When you are holy through moral conduct and a loving heart, you become a light to others  (Dt. 4:5-6; Matt. 5:14).  Conversely, you dishonor God and repel others when you break the Law (Ro. 2:23-24).  <u>Fifth</u>, God’s Law provides a standard to aspire to in your conduct, not a means for salvation.  All Scripture, including the Law, provides the standard for “teaching, for reproof, for correction, <em>for training in righteousness</em>;”  (2 Tim. 3:16).  Without a standard to aspire to, people will do whatever feels right in their own eyes (Jdgs. 21:25; 17:6). “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.”  (Prov. 14:12; 16:25; 12:15).  <u>Sixth</u>, the study of the Law also brings wisdom and understanding to you. “<em><strong><sup>98 </sup></strong>Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for they are ever mine. <strong><sup>99 </sup></strong>I have more insight than all my teachers, for Your testimonies are my meditation.</em>” (Ps. 119:98-99; Dt. 4:5-6;).  Only “fools” reject the wisdom of God’s Law (Prov. 1:7).  <u>Finally</u>, God promises certain “blessings” (unrelated to salvation) for those who follow the Law with the right motives (Dt. 28: Ps. 119:1).  </p></li>
<li><p><u>True wisdom requires that your study of the Law produces the fruit of obedience</u>. The psalmist was not wiser than his elders just because he had memorized the Law. He was wiser because he also obeyed God’s Law as it is written. “<em><strong><sup>100 </sup></strong>I understand more than those who are old, because I have complied with Your precepts. <strong><sup>101 </sup></strong>I have restrained my feet from every evil way, so that I may keep Your word. <strong><sup>102 </sup></strong>I have not turned aside from Your judgments, for You Yourself have taught me.</em>” (Ps. 119:100-102). “So keep and do them, for <em>that is your wisdom</em> and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”’ (Dt. 4:6). “The Law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, <em>making wise the simple</em>.” (Ps. 19:7). “Be very determined, then, to keep and do everything that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, so that you will not turn aside from it to the right or to the left,” (Josh. 23:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Meditate upon the God’s Law to obey Him</u>.  Like the psalmist (Ps. 119:97), Joshua also urged the Jews to mediate on God’s Law day and night:  “<em>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but</em> <em>you shall meditate on it day and night</em>, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will achieve success.”  (Josh. 1:8).  Moses gave the same commandment:  “You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul. .  .”  (Dt. 11:18).  Moses also warned that any king needed to study God’s Law all the days of his life in order to learn to fear God:  “And it shall be with him, and <em>he shall read it all the days of his life</em>, so that he will learn to fear the LORD his God, by carefully following all the words of this Law and these statutes,”  (Dt. 17:19).  Other Bible authors memorized God’s Law and His Word to keep himself on the right path: “. . . Your Law is within my heart.”  (Ps. 40:8; 1:2; Jer. 15:16).  As our example, the psalmist included regular praise for the wisdom and blessing that comes from a life devoted to studying God’s Law (Ps. 119:24, 143, 174).  Solomon also memorized the Law:  “Bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.”  (Prov. 6:21-22; 7:3).  Jesus also memorized the Law and quoted it from memory throughout His entire life.  The Law will keep your way pure (Ps. 37:31; 119:9).  It will teach and admonish you  (Col. 3:16).  When you follow it, you will bear fruit in God like a tree planted by water  (Ps. 1:1-3).  Are you meditating on His Law?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let the wisdom of God’s Law become a sweet delight to you</u>. After meditating on God’s Law, the psalmist declared, “<em>How sweet are Your words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</em>” (Ps. 119:103). The Law was sweet because of the wisdom the psalmist gained through it. “<em>From Your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way</em>.” (Ps. 119:104). “My son, eat honey, for it is good; yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste; know that wisdom is the same for your soul; if you find it, then there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.” (Prov. 24:13-14).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u><strong>Nun (</strong><span dir="rtl">נ</span><strong>):</strong> Trust God’s Word to light your path, revive you, and instruct you</u>. When you trust in God’s Word, the Holy Spirit can guide you, renew you, and He can teach you. “<strong><sup>105 </sup></strong><em>Your word is a <u>lamp</u> to my feet and a light to my path. <strong><sup>106 </sup></strong>I have sworn and I will confirm it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments. <strong><sup>107 </sup></strong>I am exceedingly afflicted; <u>revive me</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your word. <strong><sup>108 </sup></strong>Be pleased to accept the voluntary offerings of my mouth, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and <u>teach me</u> Your judgments. <strong><sup>109 </sup></strong>My life is continually in my hand, yet I do not forget Your Law. <strong><sup>110 </sup></strong>The wicked have set a trap for me, yet I have not wandered from Your precepts. <strong><sup>111 </sup></strong>I have inherited Your testimonies forever, for they are the joy of my heart. <strong><sup>112 </sup></strong>I have <u>inclined my heart</u> to perform Your statutes forever, even to the end</em>.” (Ps. 119:105-112). “The word of God directs us in our work and way, and a dark place indeed the world would be without it. The commandment is a lamp kept burning with the oil of the Spirit, as a light to direct us in the choice of our way, and the steps we take in that way.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:105-112).<a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p></li>

<p>In a dark world, let God’s Word guide you through study and prayer<a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word guide your path through study and prayer</u>. After praising the wisdom of God’s Law, the psalmist praised God’s overall Word as a guiding light for him. “<strong><sup>105 </sup></strong><em>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</em>” (Ps. 119:105). “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and rebukes for discipline are the way of life” (Prov. 6:23). “And so we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:19). God will apply His Word to your life when you study it and pray for His wisdom (Jam. 1:5-6). “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, <em>He will guide you into all the truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When God shows you His path, stay on it</u>. The psalmist proclaimed that he would remain firmly on God’s path. “<em>I have sworn and I will confirm it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments.</em>” (Ps. 119:106). This theme of staying on God’s guiding path is later repeated. “Establish my footsteps in Your word, and do not let any wrongdoing have power over me.” (Ps. 119:133). Jesus’ path is narrow. Without concerted effort, discipline, and prayer, you will likely drift off of His specific path for you. “For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:14). ‘“How are Christians to walk?’ · Worthy (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Ephesians+4.1&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Ephesians 4:1</u></a>). · Uprightly (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+57.2&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Isaiah 57:2</u></a>) · In the light (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1John+1.7&amp;t=NKJV"><u>1 John 1:7</u></a>). · Humbly (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Micah+6.8&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Micah 6:8</u></a>). None of these are possible without the word of God lighting our way.” (David Guzik on Ps. 119).<a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word guide you to revival when you are weary</u>. In the face of his affliction, the psalmist prayed for God to use it to protect him and lead him to revival. “<em>I am exceedingly afflicted; revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:107). As a confirmation that God’s Word can lead to revival, this was the second time he made this request. “My soul clings to the dust; <em>revive me according to Your word</em>.” (Ps. 119:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word guide you to give freely and to serve God out of devotion</u>. As the psalmist learned from God’s Word, he was filled with gratitude. Thus, he prayed that God would accept his voluntary offerings. “<em>Be pleased to accept the voluntary offerings of my mouth, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and teach me Your judgments.</em>” (Ps. 119:108). A voluntary offering was made as a sign of a person’s love for God (Lev. 3). You can also offer a sacrifice of praise to show your gratitude. “Through Him then, let’s continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name.” (Heb. 13:15). You can also give generously of your time, talent, and treasure to others in need and the Church.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through obedience to God’s path, God offers protection</u>. The psalmist declared that he would not “<em>forget Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:109). Because he did “<em>not wandered from</em> [God’s] <em>precepts</em>,” he did not need to worry that “<em>The wicked have set a trap for me,</em>…” (Ps. 119:110). “For it is He who rescues you from the net of the trapper...” (Ps. 91:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through obedience to God’s path, He offers joy</u>. God’s testimonies became the psalmist’s joy. “<em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>I have inherited Your testimonies forever, for they are the joy of my heart.</em>” (Ps. 119:111). Thus, he vowed to memorize and continually following them. “<em>I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever, even to the end</em>.” (Ps. 119:112). You can also rejoice over the way of life made known to you through the Word. “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.” (Ps. 16:11). But you must also stay on His path.</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Samekh (</strong><span dir="rtl">ס</span><strong>):</strong> God’s Scripture lays out the path to grow your love, patience, and confidence in Him</u>. When you follow God’s Scripture, you also help to develop a love for God’s Law and patience and confidence for God to guide you in His timing. “<strong><sup>113 </sup></strong><em>I hate those who are double-minded, but <u>I love Your Law</u>. <strong><sup>114 </sup></strong>You are my hiding place and my shield; I <u>wait</u> for Your word. <strong><sup>115 </sup></strong>Leave me, you evildoers, so that I may comply with the commandments of my God. <strong><sup>116 </sup></strong>Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live; and do not let me be ashamed of my hope. <strong><sup>117 </sup></strong>Sustain me so that I may be safe, that I may have regard for Your statutes continually. <strong><sup>118 </sup></strong>You have rejected all those who stray from Your statutes, for their deceitfulness is useless. <strong><sup>119 </sup></strong>You have removed all the wicked of the earth like impurities; therefore I love Your testimonies. <strong><sup>120 </sup></strong>My flesh trembles from the fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments</em>.” (Ps. 119:113-120). “The <em>samek</em> (119:113-120) and <em>ayin</em> (119:121-128) sections begin with ‘hate’ and ‘love’ (119:113) and end with ‘love’ and ‘hate’ (119:127-128). In both the psalmist asserts his love for the Bible (119:113 torah, 119:127 commandments).” (James Hamilton, Ps. 119:113-120).<a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to avoid being double-minded</u>. Because the psalmist loved to meditate on God’s Law, he became convicted of the sin of being double-minded between the things of God and the world. “<em>I hate those who are double-minded, but I love Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:113). Elijah told the Jews that they could not hold divided allegiances between God and Baal (1 Kgs. 18:21). James also stated that doubting God leads to the sin of being double-minded (Jam. 1:6-8). All who have strayed from Jesus’ path by embracing worldly ways must repent of their double-mindedness. (Jam. 4:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to His refuge</u>. In the face of evil, the psalmist knew than he could find refuge in God’s Word and wait for His deliverance. “<em>You are my hiding place and my shield; I wait for Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:114). When you are attacked, God’s Word also provides the path to His refuge and protection. “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (Ps. 18:30). “Let me dwell in Your tent forever; let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah” (Ps. 61:4). “He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings you may take refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and wall.” (Ps. 91:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to identify and avoid evil</u>. Because the Word of God had illuminated the narrow path of righteousness, the psalmist was able to identify the wicked’ s false paths of disobedience. “<em>Leave me, you evildoers, so that I may comply with the commandments of my God.</em>” (Ps. 119:115). To be able to discern between the right path that Jesus offers and the false paths of the wicked, you must test every spirit. “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.” (1 Jo. 4:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to find hope</u>. In the face of those who attacked him, God’s Word provided a path that the psalmist could place his hope in. “<em>Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live; and do not let me be ashamed of my hope.</em>” (Ps. 119:116). When you trust in the path that Jesus offers you, He will give you a hope that will never disappoint. “and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” (Ro. 5:5).</p></li>

<p>The hope of God’s Word encourage you during times of darkness<a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to sustain and protect you</u>. When he stayed on God’s path, the psalmist knew that God’s Word would sustain and protect. “<em>Sustain me so that I may be safe, that I may have regard for Your statutes continually.</em>” (Ps. 119:117). He makes these offers to you as well. “You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your right hand upholds me; and Your gentleness makes me great.” (Ps. 18:35). “Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture also lays out the path to purification</u>. The clarity of God’s path allowed the psalmist to see the futility of the paths of disobedience. “<em>You have rejected all those who stray from Your statutes, for their deceitfulness is useless.</em>” (Ps. 119:118). The psalmist knew that God would purify the world of the wicked and purify the wickedness in every believer’s heart. “<em>You have removed all the wicked of the earth like impurities; therefore I love Your testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:119). “Therefore this is what the LORD of armies says: ‘Behold, I will refine them and put them to the test; for what else can I do, because of the daughter of My people?”’ (Jer. 9:7). “And He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to avoiding evil</u>. The psalmist’s fear of the Lord helped him to stay on God’s narrow path when sin enticed him to look for other paths. “<em>My flesh trembles from the fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments</em>.” (Ps. 119:120). “Serve the LORD with reverence and rejoice with trembling.” (Ps. 2:11). “Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words.” (Ps. 119:161). The fear of the Lord is “hating” what His Word defines as evil (Prov. 8:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Ayin (</strong><span dir="rtl">ע</span><strong>):</strong> God’s Scripture also lays out the path to a holy life and God’s wisdom</u>. When you follow God’s Scripture and understand its wisdom, the Holy Spirit can better lead you on a path for living a holy and righteous life for Jesus. “<strong><sup>121 </sup></strong><em>I have done justice and righteousness; do not leave me to my oppressors. <strong><sup>122 </sup></strong>Be a guarantor for Your servant for good; do not let the arrogant oppress me. <strong><sup>123 </sup></strong>My eyes fail with longing for Your <u>salvation</u>, and for Your righteous word. <strong><sup>124 </sup></strong>Deal with Your servant according to Your graciousness, and teach me Your statutes. <strong><sup>125 </sup></strong>I am Your servant; give me understanding, so that I may know Your testimonies. <strong><sup>126 </sup></strong>It is time for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to act, for they have broken Your Law. <strong><sup>127 </sup></strong>Therefore <u>I love</u> Your commandments above gold, yes, above pure gold. <strong><sup>128 </sup></strong>Therefore I carefully follow all Your precepts concerning everything, I hate every false way</em>.” (Ps. 119:121-128). “On the grounds of his integrity, desire for God's word, and covenant relation to Him, the servant of God may plead for His protecting care against the wicked, gracious guidance to the knowledge of truth, and His effective vindication of the righteous and their cause, which is also His own.” (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Ps. 119:121-128).<a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Follow the path in God’s Scripture with faith-led obedience</u>. When a person acts with faith-led obedience, God offers protection according to His will. “The LORD will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated by you; they will go out against you one way and will flee at your presence seven ways.” (Dt. 28:7). For example, Job received God’s blessings prior to his trials because he also was a source of justice for the oppressed. “I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a headband.” (Job 29:14). Likewise, David received God’s blessings because he reigned as King of Israel with justice and righteousness (2 Sam. 8:15). The psalmist admitted to being a sinner, “I went astray,” (Ps. 119:67b). But he had tried to follow God’s standards of justice and righteousness. Thus, he asked for God’s grace in protecting him. “<em>I have done justice and righteousness; do not leave me to my oppressors.</em>” (Ps. 119:121). Thus, the psalmist pleaded for God’s grace in protecting him. “<em>Be a guarantor for Your servant for good; do not let the arrogant oppress me.</em>” (Ps. 119:122). “Show me a sign of good, that those who hate me may see <em>it</em> and be ashamed, because You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.” (Ps. 86:17). God’s blessings always come in His timing and according to His will. But He does reward righteousness.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to find His strength</u>. The psalmist had grown weary from his trials. But the hope of God’s promised salvation sustained him. “<em>My eyes fail with longing for Your salvation, and for Your righteous word.</em>” (Ps. 119:123). As our example, other psalmists also show that you can cry out to God in your pain while still finding hope and strength in His Word. “I am weary with my sighing; every night I make my bed swim, I flood my couch with my tears.” (Ps. 6:6). “I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.” (Ps. 69:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to His covenant</u>. The psalmist appealed to God’s covenant “<em>Ḥesed</em>” (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>). In the NASB, this translates as, “Deal with Your servant according to Your <em>graciousness,...</em>” (Ps. 119:124a). In the KJV and NKJV, this translates as: “Deal with Your servant according to Your <em>mercy</em>, …” (Ps. 119:124a). In the NIV, this translates as: “Deal with your servant according to your <em>love</em>...” (Ps. 119:124a). God’s covenant offers you all of these things - - grace, mercy, and love.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to His wisdom and truth</u>. The psalmist pleaded, “<em>and teach me Your statutes.</em> <em>I am Your servant; give me understanding, so that I may know Your testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:124b-125). In Psalm 119, the request for God to teach His statutes appears eight times (Ps. 119: 11, 26, 33, 64, 68, 108, 124, 135). For those who seek it, God offers wisdom (Jam. 1:5-6). Through study and prayer, the Holy Spirit will then strengthen you. “… <em>He will guide you into all the truth</em>; . . .” (Jo. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path for protection for the oppressed</u>. The psalmist cried out for God to act against the Jews’ oppressors. “<em>It is time for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to act, for they have broken Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:126). The wicked rejected God’s Law to instead do what felt right in their own eyes (Jdg. 21:25). But God’s truth is more valuable than money. Thus, the oppressed could find hope in God’s Law where he promises to judge evil and protect the oppressed. ‘“Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, now I will arise,’ says the LORD; ‘I will put him in the safety for which he longs.’ The words of the LORD are pure words; like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, filtered seven times. (Ps. 12:5-6). “You will arise and have compassion on Zion; for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come.” (Ps. 102:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to see God’s Commandments as your greatest treasure</u>. Because the psalmist realized that God’s Commandments were more valuable than gold, he vowed to obey them. “<em>Therefore I love Your commandments above gold, yes, above pure gold.</em> <em>Therefore I carefully follow all Your precepts concerning everything, I hate every false way</em>.” (Ps. 119:127-128). This was the second time he professed a love of God’s Commandments (Ps. 119:48). This was also the second time that he declared God’s Law as being worth more than money (Ps. 119:72). Thus, he would not make the mistake of picking and choosing which of the Commandments he felt like obeying. “I do not pick and choose among thy commandments which I will neglect and which I will obey, but esteem them all as perfect, and obey them all. … All ways are ‘false’ except the way of God's commandments.” (Pulpit Commentary on Psalm 119:128).<a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> You cannot claim to love the Law, but then allow worldly ways to take priority over it (Matt.6:24).</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Pe (</strong><span dir="rtl">פ</span><strong>ּ):</strong> God’s Scripture also lays out the path to develop an awe and longing for Him</u>. God’s Scripture shows your sinful state and the wonders of His mercy and grace. This in turn should fill you with a sense of awe for God and desire to grow even closer to Him. “<strong><sup>129 </sup></strong><em>Your testimonies are <u>wonderful</u>; therefore my soul complies with them. <strong><sup>130 </sup></strong>The unfolding of Your words gives <u>light</u>; it gives <u>understanding</u> to the simple. <strong><sup>131 </sup></strong>I opened my mouth wide and panted, for <u>I longed</u> for Your commandments. <strong><sup>132 </sup></strong>Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is right for those who love Your name. <strong><sup>133 </sup></strong>Establish my footsteps in Your word, and do not let any wrongdoing have power over me. <strong><sup>134 </sup></strong>Redeem me from oppression by man, so that I may keep Your precepts. <strong><sup>135 </sup></strong>Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes. <strong><sup>136 </sup></strong>My eyes shed streams of water, because they do not keep Your Law</em>.” (Ps. 119:129-136). “The wonders of redeeming love will fix the heart in adoration of them. The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be. They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days, understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought in vain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflicts with sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of the sacred word.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:129-136).<a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to appreciate the wonders of His mercy, grace, and love</u>. The psalmist had been disciplined for his sins (Ps. 119:67). Thus, he marveled in awe at God’s love and faithfulness in His Word. “<em>Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul complies with them.</em>” (Ps. 119:129). Other psalmists found themselves awe struck when they considered how undeserving they were of God’s mercy, grace, and love. “Many, LORD my God, are the wonders which You have done, and Your thoughts toward us; there is no one to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, they would be too numerous to count.” (Ps. 40:5). “Remember His wonders which He has done, His marvels and the judgments spoken by His mouth,” (Ps. 105:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To follow the path in God’s Scripture, have a child-like faith</u>. God’s Word does not require education to understand it. “<em>The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.</em>” (Ps. 119:130). Those without a child-like faith are in fact more likely to reject the simple message of Scripture. Jesus “said, ‘Truly I say to you, unless you change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”’ (Matt. 18:3). God’s commands made the psalmist wiser than his enemies (Ps. 119:98). He also gained understanding from God’s precepts (Ps. 119:104). God’s Word was also a light unto his path (Ps. 119:105). “[Martin] Luther renders it, ‘When thy word is revealed, so it delivers us, and makes the simple wise.’ . . . The word as used here seems to denote the opening or unfolding of the word of God; the revelation of that word to the mind. A door is open so that we enter into a house; a gate, so that we enter into a city; and thus the meaning of the word of God is ‘opened’ to us, so that we may, as it were, enter in and see its beauty.” (quoted by Albert Barnes Notes of the Bible, Ps. 119:130).<a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The more you follow the path in God’s Scripture, the more you will thirst for Him</u>. Because he appreciated their value, the psalmist longed for God’s commandments. “<em>I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed for Your commandments.</em>” (Ps. 119:131). “My soul is crushed with longing for Your ordinances at all times.” (Ps. 119:20). As their faith grew, other psalmists again came to see their need for Scripture like a thirsty person in a hot desert longing for water. “A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for You, God.” (Ps. 42:1). Just as a person must drink water, you should also constantly desire God’s commandments. “This cannot mean anything else than that he longed to know them, longed to keep them, longed to teach them, longed to bring all around him into obedience to them. Many religious people long after the promises, and they do well; but they must not forget to have an equal longing for the commandments.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:131).<a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to find Jesus’ mercy and forgiveness</u>. For those who love Jesus’ name (and the holy character it represents), He sees you through His mercy and grace. “<em>Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is right for those who love Your name.</em>” (Ps. 119:132). “Look thou upon me,.... Not as in himself; a sinful creature will not bear looking upon by the Lord, especially with the strict eye of justice; but as in Christ, and clothed with his righteousness; and so not merely in a providential way, though that is a favour, but in a way of special grace and mercy…and be merciful unto me; in forgiving his sins, and admitting him to communion with him: he pleads mercy, and not merit and this shows it was not any look but a look of grace and mercy he prays for; as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name; that is, himself: such as love the Lord have favours shown them; he shows mercy to thousands of them that love him; he loves them that love him; he manifests his love to them, and admits them to great nearness to himself.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 119:132).<a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> The psalmist was in awe of and loved God’s holy character. “To love the name of God means to… · Love the <em>person</em> of God. · Love the <em>character</em> of God. · Love the <em>revelation</em> of God. · Love the <em>glory</em> of God.” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:132) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>With faith, Jesus will give you the strength to stay on His path</u>. The psalmist prayed for the strength to stay on God’s path. “<em>Establish my footsteps in Your word, and do not let any wrongdoing have power over me.</em>” (Ps. 119:133). “I have sworn and I will confirm it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments.” (Ps. 119:106). Jesus’ path is narrow. Without faith, discipline, and prayer, you will likely drift off of His path for you. (Matt. 7:14). You must give Jesus full control over every aspect of your life. Without that, you will drift from Him. When your faith fails, pray for Him to strengthen you (Phil. 4:13).</p></li>

<p>When God reveals your path through the Word and prayer, submit to His direction<a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Your greatest goal should be to stay on and obey the path in God’s Scripture</u>. The psalmist saw his ability to serve and obey God’s precepts as a sufficient reason for his redemption. “<em>Redeem me from oppression by man, so that I may keep Your precepts</em>.” (Ps. 119:134). Zachariah also prayed for deliverance for the Jews so that they could serve God without fear. “To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of <em>our</em> enemies, would serve Him without fear,” (Lk. 1:74). Jesus came to fulfill these requests. He will give you the strength to serve Him without fearing others. “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to desiring His presence and guidance</u>. The psalmist pleaded for God’s glory to shine upon him and to teach him God’s statutes. “<em>Make Your face shine upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes.</em>” (Ps. 119:135). This repeated part of Aaron’s prayer to the Jews. “<em>The LORD cause His face to shine on you</em>, and be gracious to you;” (Nu. 6:25). David and other psalmists made similar pleas. “Many are saying, “Who will show us <em>anything</em> good?” <em>Lift up the light of Your face upon us</em>, LORD!” (Ps. 4:6). “<em>Make Your face shine upon Your servant</em>; save me in Your faithfulness.” (Ps. 31:16). “A Psalm. A Song. God be gracious to us and bless us, and <em>cause His face to shine upon us</em>— Selah” (Ps. 67:1). The psalmist made this request in connection with his eighth and final plea for God to teach him His statutes. (Ps. 119: 11, 26, 33, 64, 68, 108, 124, 135). “He desires the restoration of prosperity not merely for its own sake, but as an opportunity for gaining further knowledge.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 119:135).<a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Through the Holy Spirit, these prayers are answered. His glory is within you, and He can teach you (Jo. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to have compassion for and pray for the lost</u>. The psalmist concluded this section with tears of sadness. Others reject God’s Law and substitute it with whatever feels right in their own eyes. “<em>My eyes shed streams of water, because they do not keep Your Law</em>.” (Ps. 119:136). As our example, Jesus grieved over Jerusalem’s sins (Matt. 23:37-39) and the sins of the religious leaders (Mk. 3:5). You were meant to be Jesus’ salt and light in the world (Matt. 5:13). Like salt, you should sting in the wound of sin. Like light, your example should offer the light of Jesus’ path to the lost. With prayer, you should also pray as an intercessor to restore their lost sight.</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Tsadhe (</strong><span dir="rtl">צ</span><strong>):</strong> God’s Scripture lays out the path to know what is just and right</u>. When you trust in God’s Scripture, you never need to question the path that God has set before you. Even when worldly wisdom runs counter to it, you will delight in the righteousness found in His Word. “<strong><sup>137 </sup></strong><em>You are <u>righteous</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Your judgments are <u>right</u>. <strong><sup>138 </sup></strong>You have commanded Your testimonies <u>in righteousness</u> and great faithfulness. <strong><sup>139 </sup></strong>My zeal has consumed me, because my enemies have forgotten Your words. <strong><sup>140 </sup></strong>Your word is very pure, therefore Your servant loves it. <strong><sup>141 </sup></strong>I am small and despised, yet I do not forget Your precepts. <strong><sup>142 </sup></strong>Your <u>righteousness</u> is an everlasting righteousness, and Your Law is truth. <strong><sup>143 </sup></strong>Trouble and anguish have come upon me, yet Your commandments are my delight. <strong><sup>144 </sup></strong>Your testimonies are <u>righteous</u> forever; give me understanding that I may live</em>.” (Ps. 119:137-144). “This passage deals with the perfect righteousness of Jehovah and his word, and expresses the struggles of a holy soul in reference to that righteousness. The initial letter with which every verse commences sounds like the Hebrew word for righteousness: our keynote is righteousness.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:137-144).<a href="#fn59" id="fnref59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-119/media/image19.jpg" style="width:5.96195in;height:3.30494in" alt="His Holy Hill: Psalm 119:137-144" /></p>
<p>God’s Scripture represents His eternal righteousness and truth<a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to learn of His righteous</u>. Because God is righteous, so are His judgements and testimonies. “<em>You are righteous, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Your judgments are right.</em> <em>You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness and great faithfulness.</em>” (Ps. 119:137-138). Because God is righteous, you can trust every part of His Scripture. “<em>The Law of the LORD is perfect</em>, restoring the soul; <em>the testimony of the LORD is sure</em>, making wise the simple.” (Ps. 19:7). “<em>The LORD is righteous</em>; He has cut up the ropes of the wicked.” (Ps. 129:4). “<em>The LORD is righteous</em> in all His ways, and kind in all His works.” (Ps. 145:17). “<em>Righteous are You, LORD</em>, when I plead my case with You; …” (Jer. 12:1a). “LORD God of Israel, <em>You are righteous</em>, ...” (Ezra 9:15). “Or what great nation is there that has <em>statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Law</em> which I am setting before you today?” (Dt. 4:8). “The Rock! His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, <em>righteous and just is He</em>.” (Dt. 32:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Memorize God’s Scripture so that you can follow its path during your times of need</u>. The psalmist was consumed with angst that his enemies had forgotten God’s Word. “<em>My zeal has consumed me, because my enemies have forgotten Your words.</em>” (Ps. 119:139). In contrast, because God’s Word is righteous, he loved it. “<em>Your word is very pure, therefore Your servant loves it.</em>” (Ps. 119:140). “The words of the LORD are pure words; ...” (Ps. 12:6). “As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is refined; ...” (Ps. 18:30). Even though he felt insignificant, the psalmist would memorize God’s precepts so that he would not forget them. “<em>I am small and despised, yet I do not forget Your precepts.</em>” (Ps. 119:141). Like the psalmist, “The Bible gives us almost unending reasons to love the word of God and the God who gave it to us. · It is the word of the LORD (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+15.1&amp;t=NKJV">Genesis 15:1</a>). · It is the word of God (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+8.11&amp;t=NKJV">Luke 8:11</a>). · It is the word of the kingdom (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+13.19&amp;t=NKJV">Matthew 13:19</a>). · It is the word of salvation (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Acts+13.26&amp;t=NKJV">Acts 13:26</a>). · It is the word of grace (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Acts+14.3&amp;t=NKJV">Acts 14:3</a>). · It is the word of the gospel (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Acts+15.7&amp;t=NKJV">Acts 15:7</a>). · It is the word of faith (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Romans+10.8&amp;t=NKJV">Romans 10:8</a>). · It is the word of the cross (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+1.18&amp;t=NKJV">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>). · It is the word of reconciliation (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Corinthians+5.19&amp;t=NKJV">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). · It is the word of truth (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Corinthians+6.7&amp;t=NKJV">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>). · It is the word of life (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Philippians+2.16&amp;t=NKJV">Philippians 2:16</a>). · It is the word of Christ (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Colossians+3.16&amp;t=NKJV">Colossians 3:16</a>). · It is the word of His power (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Hebrews+1.3&amp;t=NKJV">Hebrews 1:3</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 119).<a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to everlasting truth</u>. The devil tries to sow doubt in God’s truth. But God’s Scripture, including His Law, is true and reliable for now and through all eternity. “<em>Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your Law is truth.</em>” (Ps. 119:142). “They are upheld forever and ever; they are performed in truth and uprightness.” (Ps. 119:8). “The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments is everlasting.” (Ps. 119:160). “The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.” (Ps. 19:9). “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.” (Is. 40:8). “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” (Jo. 17:17). “For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished!” (Matt. 5:18). “But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.” (Lk. 16:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the path to finding delight in Him during your trials</u>. The psalmist found himself surrounded by trouble and anguish caused by his enemies. But God’s Commandments, statutes, testimonies, and His Law brought him delight. “<em>Trouble and anguish have come upon me, yet Your commandments are my delight.</em>” (Ps. 119:143). “I shall delight in Your statutes; ...” (Ps. 119:16). “Your testimonies also are my delight; ...” (Ps. 119:24). “… But I delight in Your Law.” (Ps. 119:70).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Scripture lays out the only path to eternal life</u>. Sorrow surrounded the psalmist. But he had faith to know that God’s Scripture would reveal the path allowing him to live. “<em>Your testimonies are righteous forever; give me understanding that I may live</em>.” (Ps. 119:144). “There are delights in the word of God, which the saints often most sweetly enjoy when in trouble and anguish. This is life eternal, to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, Joh 17:3. May we live the life of faith and grace here, and be removed to the life of glory hereafter.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:137-144).<a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u><strong>Qoph (</strong><span dir="rtl">ק</span><strong>):</strong> Trust and meditate on God’s Scripture to learn to depend upon Him</u>. When you trust in God’s Scripture and meditate on it, you learn to turn to God when you need help instead of turning to worldly solutions. “<strong><sup>145 </sup></strong><em><u>I cried out</u> with all my heart; answer me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! I will comply with Your statutes. <strong><sup>146 </sup></strong>I cried to You; <u>save me</u> and I shall keep Your testimonies. <strong><sup>147 </sup></strong>I rise before dawn and cry for help; <u>I wait</u> for Your words. <strong><sup>148 </sup></strong>My eyes anticipate the night watches, so that I may <u>meditate</u> on Your word. <strong><sup>149 </sup></strong>Hear my voice according to Your faithfulness; revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your judgments. <strong><sup>150 </sup></strong>Those who follow after wickedness approach; they are far from Your Law. <strong><sup>151 </sup></strong>You are near, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and all Your commandments are truth. <strong><sup>152 </sup></strong>From long ago I have known from Your testimonies that You have founded them forever</em>.” (Ps. 119:145-152). “Unceasing prayer to be kept faithful in the midst of faithlessness is the rule of the Psalmist’s life.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 119:145-152).<a href="#fn63" id="fnref63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out for deliverance so that you can continue to serve God and obey His Scripture</u>. The psalmist showed that his prayers were genuine and authentic when he twice cried out to God. He then showed faith when he sought deliverance not for his sake, but for God’s glory to be fulfilled. “<em>I cried out with all my heart; answer me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! I will comply with Your statutes. I cried to You; save me and I shall keep Your testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:145-146). “With all my heart I have sought You; do not let me wander from Your commandments.” (Ps. 119:10). If he were to seek deliverance only to ignore God, his prayers would likely be hindered (1 Pet. 3:7). “He could not expect the Lord to hear him if he did not hear the Lord, neither would it be true that he prayed with his whole heart unless it was manifest that he laboured with all his might to be obedient to the divine will. His object in seeking deliverance was that he might be free to fulfil his religion and carry out every ordinance of the Lord.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:145).<a href="#fn64" id="fnref64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>Pray consistently and meditate on the hope of deliverance, but be patient for God’s timing</u>. The psalmist cried out both before dawn and again in the evening to be delivered. But he had the patience to wait for God’s perfect timing. “<em><strong><sup>147 </sup></strong>I rise before dawn and cry for help; I wait for Your words. My eyes anticipate the night watches, so that I may meditate on Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:147-148). As our example, the psalmists regularly prayed first thing in the morning. “<em>In the morning</em>, LORD, You will hear my voice; <em>in the morning</em> I will present my prayer to You and be on the watch.” (Ps. 5:3). “… Yes, I will joyfully sing of Your faithfulness <em>in the morning</em>, ...” (Ps. 59:16). “But I, LORD, have cried out to You for help, and <em>in the morning</em> my prayer comes before You.” (Ps. 88:13). Jesus also prayed in the morning (Mk. 1:35). Also as our example, the psalmists also regularly prayed in the evening and even at noon. “When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches,” (Ps. 63:6). “Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and moan, and He will hear my voice.” (Ps. 55:17). Jesus sometimes prayed all night (Lk. 6:12). Thus, believers must “pray without ceasing,” (1 Thess. 5:17). But God’s true love also requires patience (1 Cor. 13:4-5; Ro. 12:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for God’s deliverance through His Word to revive you to allow you to serve Him</u>. The psalmist did not want to merely be delivered. He also desired for God to revive him. “<em>Hear my voice according to Your faithfulness; revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your judgments</em>.” (Ps. 119:149). As a confirmation that God’s Word can lead to revival, this was the third time that he made this request. “… <em>revive me according to Your word</em>.” (Ps. 119:25). “… <em>revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:107).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you approach God in need of deliverance, do so in humility and in obedience</u>. God is near to and hears the prayers of those who are humble, obedient, and faithful. <em>“Those who follow after wickedness approach; they are far from Your Law. You are near, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and all Your commandments are truth.</em>” (Ps. 119:150-151). “The LORD is far from the wicked, but <em>He hears the prayer of the righteous</em>.” (Prov. 15:29). “LORD, <em>You have heard the desire of the humble</em>; You will strengthen their heart, You will make Your ear attentive.” (Ps. 10:17). “The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are toward their cry for help … The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” (Ps. 34:15, 18). “The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth.” (Ps. 145:18). “We know that God does not listen to sinners; but <em>if someone is God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him</em>.” (Jo. 9:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you cry out, place your trust in promises of God’s eternal Scripture</u>. The psalmist prayed with confidence for his deliverance because he knew that God’s promises are eternal. <em>“From long ago I have known from Your testimonies that You have founded them forever</em>.” (Ps. 119:152). “Forever, LORD, Your word stands in heaven.” (Ps. 119:89). “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.” (Matt. 24:34). “This was his testimony to answered prayer. This whole passage shows us: · How he prayed (<em>with my whole heart</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.145&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:145</u></a>). · What he prayed for (<em>save me, and I will keep Your testimonies</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.146&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:146</u></a>). · When he prayed (<em>before the dawning of the morning</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.147&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:147</u></a>). · How long he prayed (<em>through the night watches</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.148&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:148</u></a>). · The grounds of his request (<em>according to Your lovingkindness …according to Your justice</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.149&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:149</u></a>). · How God answered his prayer (<em>You are near, O LORD</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.150&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:150</u></a>) · His testimony to answered prayer (<em>Your testimonies…You have founded them forever</em>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.152&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Psalm 119:152</u></a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:145-152).<a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Resh (</strong><span dir="rtl">ר</span><strong>):</strong> Trust God’s Scripture to find His deliverance and revival when you are in need</u>. When you trust in God’s Scripture, you can cry out for Him to free you from any worldly oppression or addictions, and revive you. “<strong><sup>153 </sup></strong><em>Look at my affliction and <u>rescue me</u>, for I have not forgotten Your Law. <strong><sup>154 </sup></strong>Plead my cause and <u>redeem me;</u> <u>revive me</u> according to Your word. <strong><sup>155 </sup></strong>Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek Your statutes. <strong><sup>156</sup></strong> Great are Your mercies, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; <u>revive me</u> according to Your judgments. <strong><sup>157 </sup></strong>Many are my persecutors and my enemies, yet I do not turn aside from Your testimonies. <strong><sup>158 </sup></strong>I see the treacherous and loathe them, because they do not keep Your word. <strong><sup>159 </sup></strong>Consider how I <u>love</u> Your precepts; revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your faithfulness. <strong><sup>160 </sup></strong>The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 119:153-160). “The closer we cleave to the word of God, both as our rule and as our stay, the more assurance we have of deliverance. Christ is the Advocate of his people, their Redeemer. Those who were quickened by his Spirit and grace, when they were dead in trespasses and sins, often need to have the work of grace revived in them, according to the word of promise.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:153-160).<a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God for deliverance and revival when you are afflicted</u>. The psalmist faced “<em>afflicition.</em>” (Ps. 119: 153). “The ‘affliction’ intended is that which the psalmist suffers at the hands of his enemies, who ‘reproach’ him (ver. 22), ‘deride’ him (ver. 51), and otherwise ‘persecute’ him (ver. 161).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 119:153).<a href="#fn68" id="fnref68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> Thus, he pleaded for three things. He asked for God to: (1) “<em>rescue me,</em>” (2) “<em>redeem me</em>,” and (3) “<em>revive me</em>” all “<em>according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:153-154). This was also his fourth plea for revival. “… <em>revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:107). “… <em>revive me according to Your word</em>.” (Ps. 119:25). “<em>… revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your judgments</em>.” (Ps. 119:149). He declared “<em>for I have not forgotten Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:153). He had also made this claim previously (Ps. 119:16). This was not a request for a quid pro quo. It was instead a sign of his faith because he believed in God’s Word. “This is my comfort in my misery, that Your word has revived me.” (Ps. 119:50).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unrepentant sin can hinder your prayers when you cry out for deliverance</u>. In addition to obeying out of devotion, the psalmist knew that God was less likely to deliver him if he lived in rebellion. <em>“Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek Your statutes.</em>” (Ps. 119:155). Throughout the Old Testament, God warned that open sin could cause Him not to respond to petitions for relief from the consequences of sin:  “Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but they will not find me.”  (Prov. 1:28; Job 35:12; Micah 3:4).  “They cried for help, but there was none to save, even to the LORD, but He did not answer them.”  (Ps. 18:41; 66:18; Is. 1:15; 59:2-3(b)).  “Therefore thus says the LORD, ‘Behold I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry to Me, yet I will not listen to them.”’  (Jer. 11:11). Jesus repeated these warnings in the New Testament  (Jo. 9:31).  His blood can forgive any sin  (1 Jo. 1:9).  But Peter warns that unrepentant sin can still “hinder” a believer’s prayers  (1 Pet. 3:7). Thus, before you seek help, repent of your sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith in Jesus’ mercy and forgiveness when you cry out for help</u>. Even though he knew he was a sinner, the psalmist had faith that God would be merciful and revive him. “<em>Great are Your mercies, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; revive me according to Your judgments.</em>” (Ps. 119:156). “Though the wicked are far from <strong>salvation</strong> and far from God’s word, the <strong>tender mercies</strong> of God are close to all who will seek them. In a paradoxical way, though the salvation of God is <strong>far</strong> from them, God is not far because of His <strong>tender mercies</strong>. We can measure the greatness of this mercy: · By the infinite debt that it blots out (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+1.18&amp;t=NKJV">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+43.22-25&amp;t=NKJV">43:22-25</a>). · By the eternal ruin from which it saves (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+86.13&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 86:13</a>). · By the heavenly crown to which it raises (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Revelation+1.5-6&amp;t=NKJV">Revelation 1:5-6</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:156).<a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> The psalmist sought revival “<em>according to Your judgments.</em>” (Ps. 119:156, 154). The psalmist knew that revival could only happen according to Scripture and for God’s glory.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When your enemies attack you, take refuge in God’s Scripture and cry out for His help</u>. The psalmist had enemies who sought to cause him harm. But he found refuge in God’s “<em>testimonies</em>:” “<em>Many are my persecutors and my enemies, yet I do not turn aside from Your testimonies.</em>” (Ps. 119:157). When David and other psalmists found themselves surrounded by enemies, they also took refuge in God. “A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning Cush, a Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in You I have taken refuge; save me from all those who pursue me, and rescue me,” (Ps. 7:1). “My times are in Your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.” (Ps. 31:15). “Save me, LORD, from my enemies; I take refuge in You.” (Ps. 143:9). Taking refuge in God means that you cannot rely upon your abilities.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you seek deliverance for yourself, pray also for God to convict the sinner</u>. The psalmist was more burdened by his persecutor’s contempt for God’s Word than he was for his own wellbeing. “<em>I see the treacherous and loathe them, because they do not keep Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:158). This was the second time he expressed “rage” at those who had rejected God’s Word generally or His Law in specific. “Burning indignation has seized me because of the wicked, who abandon Your Law.” (Ps. 119:53). “Do I not hate those who hate You, LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?” (Ps. 139:21). Believers are called upon to love their enemies and pray for their persecutors. “But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” (Matt. 5:44). “bless those who curse you, pray for those who are abusive to you.” (Lk. 6:28). You can pray for God to open the eyes of sinners and convict them of their sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you seek revival, trust God’s eternal promises</u>. Because the psalmist trusted in God’s eternal promises and followed them, he prayed for revival. “<em>Consider how I love Your precepts; revive me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to Your faithfulness.</em>” (Ps. 119:159). The psalmist previously declared his love and delight in God’s Commandments (Ps. 119:47). Based upon the promises found in Scripture, he had also cried out many times for his revival (Ps. 119:15, 25, 50, 107, 149, 150, 154, 156). He trusted in Scripture as the absolute truth. “<em>The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 119:160). “… Your Law is truth.” (Ps. 119:142). “… all Your commandments are truth.” (Ps. 119:151). “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” (Jo. 17:17). God’s Word will also last forever (Is. 40:8; Matt. 5:18; Lk. 16:17). “The Scriptures are as true in Genesis as in Revelation, and the five books of Moses are as inspired as the four Gospels…. There is not one single mistake either in the word of God or in the providential dealings of God. Neither in the book of revelation nor of providence will there be any need to put a single note of errata. The Lord has nothing to regret or to retract, nothing to amend or to reverse.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 119:160).<a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u><strong>Shin(</strong><span dir="rtl">ש</span><strong>ׁ):</strong> – Trust God’s Scripture to find His protection and joy when others attack you</u>. When you trust in Scripture and take refuge in God, He becomes your shield. “<strong><sup>161 </sup></strong><em>Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words. <strong><sup>162 </sup></strong>I rejoice at Your word, like one who finds great plunder. <strong><sup>163 </sup></strong>I hate and loathe falsehood, but I <u>love</u> Your Law. <strong><sup>164 </sup></strong>Seven times a day <u>I praise You</u> because of Your righteous judgments. <strong><sup>165 </sup></strong>Those who love Your Law have great peace, and nothing causes them to stumble. <strong><sup>166 </sup></strong>I hope for Your <u>salvation</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and do Your commandments. <strong><sup>167 </sup></strong>My soul keeps Your testimonies, and I love them exceedingly. <strong><sup>168 </sup></strong>I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies, for all my ways are before You</em>.” (Ps. 119:161-168). “Those whose hearts stand in awe of God's word, will rather endure the wrath of man, than break the law of God. By the word of God we are unspeakable gainers.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 119:161-168).<a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are in need of deliverance, focus on the wonders of God’s Word</u>. Despite facing persecution from his own civil authorities, the psalmist stood in awe at the wonders of God’s mercy, grace, and love promised in His Word. “<em>Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words.</em>” (Ps. 119:161). The psalmist previously stated that he would meditate on God’s statutes in the face of government persecution. “Even though rulers sit and speak against me, Your servant meditates on Your statutes.” (Ps. 119:23). “…They have persecuted me with a lie; help me!” (Ps. 119:86). It was only because he meditated on God’s undeserved mercy, grace, love, and faithfulness that he could now feel “awe” for God in the face of ongoing persecution.</p></li>

<p>God’s Word offers you peace, hope, and comfort when others turn against you<a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you are in need of deliverance, rejoice in the comfort of God’s Scripture</u>. In the face of his persecution, the psalmist found the lies of the world to be loathsome. But he found the comfort of God’s Law to be a great treasure that gave him comfort. “<em><strong><sup>162 </sup></strong>I rejoice at Your word, like one who finds great plunder. <strong><sup>163 </sup></strong>I hate and loathe falsehood, but I love Your Law.</em>” (Ps. 119:162-163). The psalmist had now declared God’s “Word”, His “testimonies”, His “Law” and His “commandments” to be his treasure. “I have rejoiced in the way of Your <em>testimonies</em>, as much as in all riches.” (Ps. 119:14). “The <em>Law</em> of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces.” (Ps. 119:72). “Therefore I love Your <em>commandments</em> above gold, yes, above pure gold.” (Ps. 119:127). The message is that true deliverance requires that you trust, meditate, and obey all of Scripture, not just parts of it. Because all of Scripture can bless, guide, provide, and protect, you should consider all of it your greatest treasure. “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are in need of deliverance, take your eyes off yourself and praise God</u>. Instead of focusing on his own sorrow for the slander and persecution that he faced (Ps. 119:69, 161), the psalmist repeatedly praised God. “<em>Seven times a day I praise You because of Your righteous judgments.</em>” (Ps. 119:164). When David faced ongoing persecution, he also offered ongoing praise for God. “A Psalm of David, … I will bless the LORD at all times; <em>His praise shall continually be in my mouth</em>.” (Ps. 34:1). When you face a trial and you feel depressed, overwhelmed, or sad, take your eyes off yourself by praising God and giving thanks for His blessings in your life. “in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are in need of deliverance, find peace in God’s Word and His Law</u>. The psalmist sought to encourage others who might read his psalm. For those who obey God’s Law out of devotion, they will not stumble into sin. “<em>Those who love Your Law have great peace, and nothing causes them to stumble.</em>” (Ps. 119:165). When you seek to live according to God’s standards of right and wrong, you never need to fear the consequences that come from embracing what God defines as evil. Jesus then offers you His peace in the face of any trial. “Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are in need of deliverance, place your hope in God’s salvation and obey Him</u>. In the face of persecution, the psalmist placed his hope in God’s promised salvation. Out of gratitude, he would respond by obeying all of God’s Scripture. “<em><strong><sup>166 </sup></strong>I hope for Your salvation, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and do Your commandments. <strong><sup>167 </sup></strong>My soul keeps Your testimonies, and I love them exceedingly. <strong><sup>168 </sup></strong>I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies, for all my ways are before You</em>.” (Ps. 119:166-168). The psalmist had repeatedly placed his hope in God’s salvation as promised in His Word. “My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for Your word.” (Ps. 119:81). “Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live; and do not let me be ashamed of my hope.” (Ps. 119:116). David also put his hope in God. “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.” (Ps. 39:7). You also have the hope of salvation as promised in Jesus’ Word. “and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.” (Ro. 5:5). “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). Like the psalmist, you should respond to Jesus’ hope by offering your obedience (Ro. 12:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Tav (</strong><span dir="rtl">ת</span><strong>ּ):</strong> During a trial, trust God’s Scripture by depending upon Him and praising Him</u>. When you trust in God’s Scripture, you can rest assured that He hears your cries for help. Thus, you can turn to Him in times of need and praise Him for all that He does. “<strong><sup>169 </sup></strong><em>Let <u>my cry come before</u> You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; give me understanding according to Your word. <strong><sup>170 </sup></strong>Let my pleading come before You; <u>save me</u> according to Your word. <strong><sup>171 </sup></strong>Let my lips pour out praise, for You teach me Your statutes. <strong><sup>172 </sup></strong>Let my tongue sing about Your word, for all Your commandments are righteousness. <strong><sup>173 </sup></strong>Let Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts. <strong><sup>174 </sup></strong>I long for Your <u>salvation</u>, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Your Law is my delight. <strong><sup>175 </sup></strong>Let my soul live that it may praise You, and let Your ordinances help me. <strong><sup>176 </sup></strong>I have wandered about like a lost sheep; search for Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments</em>.” (Ps. 119:169-176). “This commences a new division of the psalm, indicated by the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the letter Tau (<span dir="rtl">ט</span> ṭ), corresponding to our ‘t,’ or ‘th.’ The petition here is, that his prayer might be heard; that it might come into the very presence of God; that there might be no obstructions to its reaching where God was. Let nothing from my unworthiness, from my past sins, from my ignorance, prevent its coming before thee. Something often apparently hinders our prayers so that they do not reach the ear of God. The psalmist prays here that there may be no such hindrance in the prayer which he now offers.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 119:169-176).<a href="#fn74" id="fnref74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Crying out to God in times of need is sign of your faith in Him</u>. The psalmist concluded with five petitions to God based his faith and trust in the promises of His Scripture. He sought (1) understanding “<em><u>Let</u> my cry come before You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; give me understanding according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:169; 119:144); (2) deliverance, “<em><u>Let</u> my pleading come before You; save me according to Your word.</em>” (Ps. 119:170; 119:154; 59:1); (3) instruction, “<em><u>Let</u> my lips pour out praise, for You teach me Your statutes.</em>” (Ps. 119:171); (4) righteousness, “<em><u>Let</u> my tongue sing about Your word, for all Your commandments are righteousness.</em>” (Ps. 119:172); and (5) help, “<em><u>Let</u> Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts</em>.” (Ps. 119:173; Ps. 18:6; 102:1; 140:6). In each request, he depended upon God alone to help him. “The ending section of this great psalm emphasizes the psalmist’s great need for God and his dependence upon Him. His love for and dedication to the word of God has not made him more spiritually <em>independent</em>, but more spiritually <em>dependent</em> upon God. What did the psalmist need? · Understanding (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.169&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:169</a>). · Deliverance (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.170&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:170</a>). · Ability to worship God rightly (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.171-172&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:171-172</a>). · Power to live an upright life (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.173-174&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:173-174</a>). · Strength to persevere (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+119.175&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 119:175</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 119:169-176) (italics in original).<a href="#fn75" id="fnref75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>During your trials, place your hope in God’s salvation</u>. The psalmist did not know the outcome of his trials. But there were two conclusions that he reached. Regardless of the outcome, he would continue to obey God’s Law and keep his hope in God’s salvation. “<em>I long for Your salvation, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Your Law is my delight.</em>” (Ps. 119:174). “My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for Your word.” (Ps. 119:81). “I hope for Your salvation, LORD, and do Your commandments.” (Ps. 119:166). Jesus came to fulfill this hope. “For my eyes have seen Your salvation,” (Lk. 2:30). “for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” (1 Pet. 1:23). During your trials, let Jesus also be your hope.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek deliverance to bring glory to God</u>. The psalmist sought deliverance not for his own glory. Instead, he asked for deliverance so that he could live to praise God. “<em>Let my soul live that it may praise You, and let Your ordinances help me.</em>” (Ps. 119:175). David and other psalmists also sought deliverance so that they could give God the glory. “Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation; <em>then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness</em>.” (Ps. 51:14). “So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture will give thanks to You forever; to all generations we will tell of Your praise.” (Ps. 79:13). “ I will sing of the graciousness of the LORD forever; to all generations I will make Your faithfulness known with my mouth.” (Ps. 89:1). When God delivers you, sing His praises to others. By giving God the glory, you can give others hope.</p></li>
<li><p><u>To remain free from oppression, seek out and depend upon the Good Shepherd</u>. The psalmist concluded with a plea for God to protect, care, and guide him as the Good Shepherd would do for any lost sheep. He also knew that he would only hear the call of the Good Shepherd by studying God’s Scripture. “<em>I have wandered about like a lost sheep; search for Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments</em>.” (Ps. 119:176). God loving His people, the way a shepherd loves a flock of sheep, is captured in Isaiah:  “Like a shepherd He will tend His flock, in His arm <em>He will gather the lambs and carry them in the fold of His robe; He will gently lead the nursing ewes</em>.”  (Is. 40:11).  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus, the Good Shepherd, seeks to reclaim His lost sheep</u>.  The psalmist called himself a “<em>lost sheep</em>.” (Ps. 119:176). Without a shepherd, sheep will wander off.  Sin also makes us behave like aimless sheep.  Our Good Shepherd has come to reclaim His lost sheep:  “<em>All of us, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way</em>; but the LORD has caused the wrongdoing of us all to fall on Him.”  (Is. 53:6).  “<em>As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep</em> and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day.”  (Ezek. 34:12).  “But He answered and said, ‘<em>I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel</em>.’”  (Matt. 15:24).  Like sheep, we must also respond to our Shepherd’s call: “For <em>you were continually straying like sheep</em>, but now <em>you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls</em>.” (1 Pet. 2:25).  “For He is our God, and <em>we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand.  Today, if you will hear His voice</em>,  (Ps. 95:5).  “He again sets a certain day, ‘Today,’ saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, ‘Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”’ (Heb. 4:7).  Are you reading Scripture and praying to hear His call?</p></li>

<p>Depend upon the Good Shepherd by submitting to His Scripture<a href="#fn76" id="fnref76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>For Jesus to be your Shepherd, you must also submit and obey Him</u>.  Many sheep will not willingly submit to their shepherds.  Likewise, not everyone who hears Jesus’ calling accepts Him as their Lord and Savior.  Many sadly prefer the darkness and sin that are found off the narrow path that He offers His flock:  “And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil.”  (Jo. 3:19).  If Jesus is to be your Shepherd, you must submit to Him:  “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd.”  (Jo. 10:16).  “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.”  (Matt. 7:21; Lk. 6:46). To fully enjoy the guidance, protection, and provision of the Good Shepherd, you must fully submit to all of His Scripture. “<em>All Scripture</em> is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness;” (2 Tim. 3:16).</p></li>
