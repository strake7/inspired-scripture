<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalms 146 through 150 culminate the Psalter. Each of these final psalms begin and end with the psalmist’s praise for Yahweh. While the Jews remained subjects of the Persian empire, the psalmist wrote in hope and anticipation of the arrival of the Messiah who would establish a just, perfect reign, and fulfill all of the promises in God’s Word. This foreshadowed Jesus. He came to fulfill every promise in the Bible, and He offers hope. From the psalmist’s praises, the Bible reveals many reasons for praising Jesus. He offers you eternal: (1) salvation, (2) faithfulness, (3) justice, (4) provision, (5) deliverance, (6) protection, and (7) His sovereignty.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for the salvation that He alone makes possible. He warned that salvation through man is not possible. This again foreshadowed Jesus. He alone makes your eternal salvation possible through His sacrifice at the cross. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh as the Creator who is faithful to keep His promises forever. You can also trust in Jesus the Creator because He is faithful to keep His promises for all eternity. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for His justice for the oppressed. You can also praise Jesus because He is always just and fair. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for providing to those who are hungry. You can also praise Jesus because He provides for your needs. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for delivering the oppressed and opening the eyes of those who are blind out of love. You can also praise Jesus for His loving deliverance from both physical and spiritual bondage. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for protecting those in need by thwarting the plans of the wicked. You can also praise Jesus for protecting you from evil. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist praised Yahweh for His eternal reign. You can also praise Jesus for His eternal reign as King of Kings.</p>
<h2 id="salvation-praise-jesus-for-the-salvation-that-he-alone-offers.-ps.-1461-4."><strong>1. <u>Salvation: Praise Jesus for the Salvation that He Alone Offers</u>. Ps. 146:1-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God’s plan for your salvation</u>. For emphasis, the psalmist praised Yahweh four times for the salvation that He alone provides for those who put their trust in Him: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul! <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>I will praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish</em>.” (Ps. 146:1-4). In the Greek Septuagint, this psalm begins, “Alleluia, a Psalm of Aggaeus [Haggai] and Zacharias. My soul, praise the Lord.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although the authorship is disputed, this psalm is believed to be a post-exile psalm. At the time, the Jews remained under Persia’s control. The warning not to trust in strong men (Ps. 146:3) “might indicate that there were people in Zion who advocated alliances with foreign powers for deliverance from danger. But mere humans cannot be looked to for security, whether they are powerful or not.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 146:3).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Salvation cannot come through mankind</u>. The psalmist praised Yahweh because He alone offers “<em>salvation</em>” (Ps. 146:3). David and other psalmists repeatedly praised Yahweh for the salvation that He alone offers. “<em>Salvation belongs to the LORD;</em> may Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah” (Ps. 3:8). “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be <em>the God of my salvation</em>, . . . He gives <em>great salvation</em> to His king, and shows faithfulness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” (Ps. 18:46, 50). “<em>Lord,</em> in Your strength the king will be glad, and <em>in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!</em>” (Ps. 21:1).  “The LORD … He is a refuge of <em>salvation to His anointed</em>.” (Ps. 28:8). “But the <em>salvation</em> of the righteous is from the LORD;...” (Ps. 37:39). “GOD the Lord, <em>the strength of my salvation</em>,...” (Ps. 140:7). Job also professed faith in his Redeemer: “Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.” (Job 19:25). Your redemption is only possible through faith in God: “I, only I, am the LORD, and <em>there is no savior besides Me</em>.” (Is. 43:11). Many Jews understood this to mean a physical salvation. Jesus came and expanded the meaning of this to also include the spiritual salvation of your soul for all eternity.</p></li>

<p>Jesus offers the only path leading to salvation<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus was crucified so that everyone might find eternal life</u>.  Jesus died on the cross and rose again to allow all who believe in Him to have eternal life:  “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”  (Jo. 3:16).  “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’”  (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). What Jesus offers is a “free” gift that only requires faith in Him:  “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is <em>eternal life</em> in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  (Ro. 6:23). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not place your trust in yourself, powerful leaders, political parties, or government</u>. At a time when Israel was a weak vassal state of Persia with enemies all around it, the psalmist urged God’s people, “<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.</em>” (Ps. 146:3) “At the time of the return from the Captivity, too much was expected from Zerubbabel and the other ‘princes.”’ (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 146:3).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The person who puts their trust in other persons instead of God is “cursed”. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the LORD.”’ (Jer. 17:5). Thus, David and other psalmists declared that they would place their trust in neither themselves or others. “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength.” (Ps. 33:16). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “Oh give us help against the enemy, for rescue by man is worthless.” (Ps. 60:11). “Give us help against the enemy, for deliverance by man is worthless.” (Ps. 108:12). “It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in people. It is better to take refuge in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than to trust in noblemen.” (Ps. 118:8-9). In most western democracies, it is common for people to place their hope in their political candidate or political party to save them from their problems. But believers are called upon to place their hope and trust in Jesus alone.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When your flesh is weak, pray and exhort your soul to return to God</u>. In the context of a prayer or worship praise, this one of six psalms where the psalmist exhorted his own soul to turn to Yahweh: “<em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my soul!</em>” (Ps. 146:1). “Why are you in despair, my soul?” (Ps. 42:5). “Why are you in despair, my soul?” (Ps. 43:5). “A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, my soul, ...” (Ps. 103:1). “Bless the LORD, my soul! …” (Ps. 104:1). “Return to your rest, my soul,…” (Ps. 116:7). Many rely upon their instincts during a trial. But “[t]he heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). Thus, when your flesh is filled with doubt or worldly thoughts, Welsh Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_Lloyd-Jones">Martyn Lloyd-Jones</a> urged believers to exhort their souls to turn back to God. “Have you realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself?”<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Make a life-long commitment to praising Jesus<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Show your gratitude with life-long praise</u>. The psalmist vowed to sing praises to Yahweh for as long as he lived. “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>I will praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.</em>” (Ps. 146:2). For emphasis, this repeated the promise of another psalmist. “I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.” (Ps. 104:33). Your praise should also be a life-long endeavor.</p></li>

<h2 id="faithfulness-praise-jesus-the-author-of-creation-because-you-can-trust-in-his-faithfulness-for-all-eternity.-ps.-1465-6."><strong>2. <u>Faithfulness: Praise Jesus, the Author of Creation, Because You Can Trust in His Faithfulness for All Eternity</u>. Ps. 146:5-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God to keep His promises to you</u>. Yahweh showed His omnipotent power when He created heaven and Earth. The psalmist therefore encouraged believers to trust in His ability to keep everyone of His promises for all eternity. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God, <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>who made heaven and earth, the sea and everything that is in them; who keeps faith forever</em>;” (Ps. 146:5-6). “It is a great support to faith that the Redeemer of the world is the same that was the Creator of it, and therefore has a good-will to it, a perfect knowledge of its case, and power to help it. He is a God of inviolable fidelity. We may venture to take God’s word, for he <em>keepeth truth for ever,</em> and therefore no word of his shall fall to the ground; it is true <em>from the beginning,</em> and therefore true <em>to the end.</em> Our Lord Jesus is the Amen, <em>the faithful witness,</em> as well as <em>the beginning,</em> the author and principle, <em>of the creation of God,</em> Rev. 3:14. The keeping of God’s truth for ever is committed to him, for <em>all the promises</em> are in him <em>yea and amen.</em>” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 146:6) (italics in original).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Yahweh blesses those who trust Him</u>. Those who trust in Yahweh are “<span dir="rtl">אַשְׁרֵ֗י</span>” (’aš·rê) (Ps. 146:5). In the NASB, NIV, and Berean Bibles, this is translated as “<em>Blessed</em>”. In the KJB and NKJV, this is translated as “<em>Happy</em>.” Throughout the Bible, Yahweh promises to bless those who trust in Him. “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD.” (Jer. 17:7). “How blessed is the man who has made the LORD his trust, and has not turned to the proud, nor to those who become involved in falsehood.” (Ps. 40:4). “LORD of armies, blessed is the person who trusts in You!” (Ps. 84:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>As part of the triune God, Jesus is the all-powerful Creator</u>. The psalmist praised the Creator (Ps. 146:6). The New Testament reveals that Jesus is the omnipotent Creator of all life. “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.” (Jo. 1:3). “for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Col. 1:16). “in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the world.” (Heb. 1:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust in the Creator to keep His promises</u>. The psalmist also proclaimed that believers could trust in Yahweh because He “<em>made heaven and earth, the sea and everything that is in them;</em>” (Ps. 146:6). The New Testament quotes from this verse to make clear that you can also trust in Jesus because He is all-powerful. “And when they heard this, they raised their voices to God with one mind and said, ‘<em>Lord, it is You</em> <em>who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything that is in them</em>,” (Acts 4:24). “and saying, ‘Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, of the same nature as you, preaching the gospel to you, to turn from these useless things to <em>a living God,</em> <em>who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything that is in them</em>.” (Acts 14:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is faithful to keep all His promises</u>.  The psalmist praised Yahweh because He “<em>keeps faith forever</em>;” (Ps. 146:6). Also as our example, Moses celebrated God’s faithfulness: “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;”  (Dt. 7:9).  “ . . . I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, . . . showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.”  (Ex. 20:5-6).  “and I will remember My covenant, . . .”  (Gen. 9:15; Neh. 1:5).  Do your prayers also praise God for His faithfulness?  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is also faithful</u>.  As part of the triune God, Jesus is also faithful to keep His promises to you:  “God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (1 Cor. 1:9).  “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). He is faithful, even when we are not:  “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.”  (2 Tim. 2:13).   This means that you can trust His many promises to you.  But you cannot have faith in His many promises if you don’t know them.  How many of Jesus’ promises can you name?</p></li>

<h2 id="justice-praise-jesus-because-he-is-also-just-and-fair.-ps.-1467a."><strong>3. <u>Justice: Praise Jesus Because He is Also Just and Fair</u>. Ps. 146:7a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God’s justice when you are attacked or oppressed</u>. For those suffering from oppression, the psalmist also urged them to place their trust in Yahweh’s perfect justice. “<strong><sup>7a </sup></strong><em>who executes justice for the oppressed;</em>…” (Ps. 146:7a). “All judgment being committed to Christ as Mediator, he executes it on the behalf of his oppressed ones, and breaks in pieces their oppressors; …” (John Gill’s Commentary on Ps. 146:7).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-146/media/image5.jpg" style="width:6.11748in;height:1.87036in" alt="Jesus: The Righteous Judge - Daily Word" /></p>
<p>Jesus is our just and righteous judge<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is just to deliver His people according to His perfect timing</u>. The psalmist praised Yahweh because He provides justice for the oppressed (Ps. 146:7). The psalms are filled with similar praises for Yahweh because He is just and fair: “<em>For the LORD is righteous</em>, He loves righteousness; the upright will see His face.” (Ps. 11:7) ‘“<em>Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise</em>,’ says the LORD; ‘I will put him in the safety for which he longs.”’ (Ps. 12:5). “Love the LORD, all His godly ones! <em>The LORD watches over the faithful</em> but fully repays the one who acts arrogantly.” (Ps. 31:23). “<em>For the LORD loves justice and does not abandon His godly ones</em>; they are protected forever, but the descendants of the wicked will be eliminated.” (Ps. 37:28). “God makes a home for the lonely; <em>He leads out the prisoners into prosperity</em>, only the rebellious live in parched lands.” (Ps. 68:6). “<em>For the LORD hears the needy, and does not despise those of His who are prisoners</em>.” (Ps. 69:33). “The strength of the King loves justice; You have established order; <em>You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob</em>.” (Ps. 99:4). God’s justice and His deliverance will always come according to His perfect timing. Thus, He wants you to be patient and trust Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8).  “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30).  “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “<sup>1</sup> Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <sup>2 </sup>The Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding</em> . . . <em>with righteousness He will judge</em> the poor, and decide with fairness for the humble of the earth; . . . <sup>5 </sup>Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.” (Is. 11:1-5). “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with <em>justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore</em>.”  (Is. 9:7; 16:5).  “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  His righteous reign is another reason to praise Him.</p></li>

<h2 id="provision-praise-jesus-because-he-also-provides-for-your-needs.-1467a."><strong>4. <u>Provision: Praise Jesus Because He Also Provides for Your Needs</u>. 146:7a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God to provide for your needs, not wants</u>. For those who hunger or have other physical needs, the psalmist urged them to place their trust in Yahweh to provide. “<strong><sup>7b</sup></strong> … <em>who gives food to the hungry</em>.” (Ps. 146:7a). Yahweh “supplies the needs of the poor that are ready to perish for want; ...” (Joseph Benson on Ps. 146:7).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-146/media/image6.jpg" style="width:6.057in;height:2.50447in" alt="Premium Photo | Jesus giving bread for lots of people" /></p>
<p>Turn to Jesus to provide for your every need<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Where God guides, He provides</u>. If you are in need, you must first submit to the guidance of the Good Shepherd: “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I will not be in need.” (Ps. 23:1). During the exodus, God provided for every need of His people (Dt. 2:7). He also showed His love for them and instructed them while they were in the wilderness (Dt. 32:10). Thus, David praised God for guiding His people through the wilderness: “God, when You went forth before Your people, when You marched through the desert, Selah” (Ps. 68:7). “And the LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, so that they might travel by day and by night.” (Ex. 13:21). “But He led His own people out like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;” (Ps. 78:52). You should then give thanks for Jesus’ guidance and provision in your life.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus promises to provide for your needs, not wants</u>. Jesus provides for all creation: “Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!”  (Lk. 12:24; Matt. 6:26; Job 38:41).  “Who gives food to all flesh, for His faithfulness is everlasting.” (Ps. 136:25). “It is He who gives an animal its food, and feeds young ravens that cry.” (Ps. 147:9). Jesus will also provide for your needs when you seek after His Kingdom. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “But seek His kingdom, and these things will be provided to you.” (Lk. 12:31). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19). Jesus’ provision in your life is a sign of His love for you and another reason for you to praise Him: “yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” (Acts 14:17). Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from Him (Jam. 1:17). If you have any need that is unmet, seek after Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Delight yourself in the things of God, and He will fulfill your desires</u>. If you desire what Yahweh desires, He will fulfill your desires. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). Is your heart set on what God’s desires?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in your loving God to deliver you from physical and spiritual bondage</u>. For those in physical or spiritual bondage, the psalmist urged believers to place their trust in Yahweh’s love for them to deliver them. “<strong><sup>7c</sup></strong> <em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> frees the prisoners. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> opens the eyes of those who are blind; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raises up those who are bowed down; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> loves the righteous</em>.” (Ps. 146:7c-8). “Here follow five lines, each beginning with the Divine name, and each consisting of three words, the rhythm prominent in the book of Job.” (Charles Ellicott’s on Ps. 146:7).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> “Observe how these Divine works were literally manifested in Christ’s miracles.” (Alexander Kirkpatrick on Ps. 146:7).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus offers you freedom from bondage<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you place your trust in Jesus, He offers physical deliverance</u>. The psalmist praised Yahweh for freeing His people from captivity. “<strong><sup>7c</sup></strong> <em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> frees the prisoners.</em>” (Ps. 146:7c). “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD anointed me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, <em>to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners</em>;” (Is. 61:1). David also proclaimed: “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>You have ascended on high, <em>You have led captive Your captives</em>; You have received gifts among people,” (Ps. 68:18). Jesus came to fulfill these promises to offer all freedom from physical bondage: “But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says, ‘When He ascended on high, <em>He led captive the captives</em>, and He gave gifts to people.”’ (Eph. 4:7-8). “Jesus is the Emancipator, spiritually, providentially, and nationally.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 146:7).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus also came to give sight to those who are spiritually blind<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you trust Jesus, He also offers spiritual deliverance</u>. The psalmist praised Yahweh for opening “<em>the eyes of those who are blind;</em>” (Ps. 146:8). The Messiah would open the eyes of the blind. “Then <em>the eyes of those who are blind will be opened</em>, and the ears of those who are deaf will be unstopped. Then those who limp will leap like a deer, and the tongue of those who cannot speak will shout for joy. For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.” (Is. 35:5-6). Jesus came to fulfill these promises. “And the scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written: ‘The Spirit if the LORD is upon Me, because He anointed Me to bring good news to the poor. <em>He has sent Me to proclaim release to captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed</em>, to proclaim the favorable year of the LORD.”’ (Lk. 4:17-19). “Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Go and report to John what you hear and see: <em>those who are blind receive sight</em> and those who limp walk, those with leprosy are cleansed and those who are deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.”’ (Matt. 11:4-5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for having conquered death and the devil</u>.  The psalmist further proclaimed that “<em>the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raises up those who are bowed down; …</em>.” (Ps. 146:8). Satan desires to bring everyone down with him.  But Jesus can restore you. “But You, LORD, are a shield around me, My glory, and <em>the One who lifts my head</em>.” (Ps. 3:3). You can also give thanks that Jesus not only defeated your enemy Satan but also death:  “The last enemy that will be abolished is death.”  (1 Cor. 15:26). Because of His death, you can enjoy eternal life with Him in heaven. “<em>You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the ground</em>.” (Ps. 104:30). “The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.” (Job 33:4). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). Thus, for many reasons, Jesus deserves your praise and gratitude.</p></li>

<h2 id="protection-praise-jesus-for-his-protecting-those-in-need.-ps.-1469."><strong>6. <u>Protection: Praise Jesus For His Protecting Those in Need</u>. Ps. 146:9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in God to protect you during your times of need</u>. For those who are under attack, the psalmist also urged them to turn to Yahweh for protection. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow, but He thwarts the way of the wicked</em>.” (Ps. 146:9). “The psalmist here continues a marvelous description of Yahweh as a God of power, care, justice, and compassion. The psalmist seems delighted to describe Yahweh in His great works of love and power … We instantly connect this list with the work of Jesus the Messiah. · Jesus opened <strong>the eyes of the blind</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+9.27-29&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 9:27-29</u></a>). · Jesus raised <strong>those who are bowed down</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+13.11-13&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Luke 13:11-13</u></a>). · Jesus loved <strong>the righteous</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+13.43&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 13:43</u></a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+25.46&amp;t=NKJV"><u>25:46</u></a>). · Jesus watched <strong>over the strangers</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+8.5-10&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 8:5-10</u></a>). · Jesus blessed <strong>the fatherless and widow</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+7.12-15&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Luke 7:12-15</u></a>). · Jesus turned <strong>the way of the wicked…upside down</strong> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+21.12&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 21:12</u></a>). · The logical conclusion is that Jesus is Yahweh, <strong>the LORD</strong>.” (David Guzik on Ps. 146:8) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God protects immigrants</u>. The psalmist declared, “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over strangers;</em>” (Ps. 146:9). As part of God’s protection of strangers or immigrants, He commands to show compassion toward immigrants and strangers: “You shall not wrong a stranger [foreigner] or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 22:21). Possibly because most believers have difficulty following this law, God repeated it multiple times throughout the Torah: “You shall not oppress a stranger [foreigner], since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 23:9). “When a stranger [foreigner] resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. The stranger [foreigner] who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, <em>and you shall love him as yourself,</em> for you were aliens in the land of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.” (Lev. 19:33-34). “So show your love for the alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.” (Dt. 10:19). “You shall not pervert the justice due an alien or an orphan, nor take a widow's garment in pledge. But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.” (Dt. 24:17-18). When you help a stranger (which includes immigrants) you may even be entertaining angels: “Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it.” (Heb. 13:2). Is your heart hardened toward strangers and immigrants?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The law protecting widows and the poor</u>. God also protects the most vulnerable members of society. These include, but are not limited to, widows and orphan<em>s:</em> “<sup><em>22</em> </sup>You shall not afflict any widow or orphan. <sup>23 </sup>If you afflict him at all, and if he does cry out to Me, I will surely hear his cry; <sup>24 </sup>and My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless<em>.”</em> (Ex. 22:22-24). “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.” (Dt. 10:18). “[L]earn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, [and] plead for the widow.” (Is. 1:17; Micah. 6:8). “He who oppresses the poor to make more for himself or who gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.” (Prov. 22:16). “The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor, the wicked does not understand such concern.” (Prov. 29:7; 14:31; 31:9; Dt. 27:19). God required that the Jews give generously to those in need even if they did not expect their money to be paid back (Dt. 15:7-8). Land owners were likewise required to allow the poor to glean the fields so that they would not go hungry (Ex. 23:10-13; Lev. 19:9-10; 23:22; Dt. 24:19-21). In heaven, Jesus will ask what you did for the poor and the needy (Matt. 25:40). Will you have anything to share with Jesus on this subject?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When Jesus is your refuge, He will also be your shield to protect you from evil</u>. You don’t need to be an immigrant, a widow, an orphan, or a poor person to receive God’s protection. David revealed that God protects all who take refuge in Him. ““As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the LORD is tested; <em>He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him</em>.” (2 Sam. 22:31). “Every word of God is tested; <em>He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him</em>.” (Prov. 30:5). My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:3). “The LORD will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). Believers should also put on the spiritual armor of God. “Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:11-12). When you wear God’s armor, no spiritual weapon of the enemy can harm you. “No weapon that is formed against you will prosper; . . .” (Is. 54:17). Jesus invites you to seek His protection (Matt. 6:13). If you submit to Him, He will also be your hedge of protection.</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-jesus-for-his-eternal-reign-as-king-of-kings.-ps.-14610."><strong>7. <u>Sovereignty: Praise Jesus For His Eternal Reign as King of Kings</u>. Ps. 146:10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust in God’s victory over evil</u>. No power can stop Yahweh’s perfect, sovereign reign. Thus, every generation should praise Him. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will reign forever, Your God, Zion, to all generations. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 146:10). “In Ps 145 David connects the fulfillment of God’s promises to the faithfulness of God’s character, and Pss 146-150 celebrate the total victory of the living God over all darkness, devilry, and death … The sin and death and suffering that pervade the world cause people to doubt God’s word. Psalm 145, however, has affirmed that God’s word will be true because God’s character guarantees it. God has promised nothing less than <em>redemption, justification, forgiveness, reconciliation, resurrection, and renewal</em>, all to be accomplished by the promised victory of the future king from David’s line.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 146) (emphasis added).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus came to fulfill God’s Covenant</u>. God promised that the Messiah would come from David’s line (1 Chr. 17:11-12; 22:10; 2 Sam. 7:13; Jer. 33:17).  ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.’ Selah.”  (Ps. 89:4). “He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.”  (Ps. 18:50).  “So I will establish his descendants forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” (Ps. 89:29). Jesus was born into David’s line, and He fulfilled the promise of an eternal kingdom. “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of armies will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:7). “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’ (Jer. 32:5). “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33).</p></li>

<p>Jesus traded His crown of thorns for a crown of glory as the King of Kings<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign as the King of Glory</u>.  Jesus also came to fulfill these promises as the eternal King of Kings:  “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”  (Lk. 1:32-33).  “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.” (Rev. 19:16). Jesus, the King of Glory, rules in righteousness in heaven: “So I will establish his descendants forever and <em>his throne as the days of heaven</em>.” (Ps. 89:29).  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will be praised for all eternity</u>. The psalmist urged every generation to praise Yahweh (Ps. 146:10). This was similar to David’s promise to praise Yahweh forever. “My mouth will speak the praise of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:21). In heaven, believers will be so overcome with loving devotion for all that Jesus has done that they will praise Him forever. “And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.”’ (Rev. 5:13).</p></li>
