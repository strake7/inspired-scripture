<h1 id="proverbs-9-lessons-from-the-rival-banquets-of-wisdom-and-folly">Proverbs 9: Lessons From the Rival Banquets of Wisdom and Folly</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 9 concludes Solomon’s prologue. To illustrate the importance of accepting Yahweh’s wisdom, Solomon describes two banquets. Yahweh hosts one banquet where He offers a great feast (a symbol of fellowship) for all who turn from sin and accept His wisdom. Yahweh warns that the spiritual harlot (the devil) offers an alternative banquet. But his banquet offers only sorrow and death. This parable foreshadows the Gospel. Jesus is Yahweh, the great “I AM” (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). Through Proverbs 9, Jesus reveals His (1) universal invitation, (2) His call to evangelize, (3) His call to repent, (4) His call to be Spirit-led, (5) His call to fear Him by hating evil, (6) His offers to bless you, and (7) His warnings about Satan.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Yahweh began by calling all to accept His invitation to come to His dwelling for a great banquet. Jesus has prepared a great banquet with a place in heaven for all with the faith to accept His invitation. <u>Second</u>, Yahweh reveals that He has called upon His servants to spread the invitation for His banquet. Jesus calls upon all believers to share the Good News of His invitation. <u>Third</u>, Yahweh reveals that the wise must respond to His call by repenting of their foolish ways. Jesus’ invitation is available to all who repent. <u>Fourth</u>, Yahweh warns believers not to squander their time sharing His invitation with the fools who are wise in their own eyes. To know where to serve Jesus, you must let the Holy Spirit guide you. <u>Fifth</u>, Yahweh then repeated that true wisdom begins with fearing Him. In Proverbs 8, Solomon defined the fear of Yahweh as hating evil. Wisdom comes from Jesus and is available to all who seek Him and hate what He defines as evil in His Word. <u>Sixth</u>, Yahweh promised blessings, including life, for all who accept His invitation. Jesus offers blessing for all with the faith to accept His call. <u>Finally</u>, Yahweh warns that the spiritual harlot has prepared a false banquet. Those who reject Jesus’ banquet and instead accept Satan’s false banquet will one day face sorrow and judgment.</p>

Prov. 9:1-2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers an eternal home and eternal fellowship for all who answer His call in faith</u>. Yahweh calls all to be wise and accept His invitation to His eternal home and fellowship. “<strong><sup>1</sup> </strong><em>Wisdom has built her house, she has carved out her seven pillars; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>she has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table</em>;” (Prov. 9:1-2). “It is not an unusual custom in the Old Testament to describe intimate communion with God, and the refreshment which the soul of man thereby receives, under the figure of a festival. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-11.htm">Exodus 24:11</a>, when the elders of Israel were admitted to the vision of the Almighty, they ‘did eat and drink.’ The same idea occurs frequently in the prophets also (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-13.htm">Isaiah 65:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7-8</a>); and is brought out in the New Testament with great fulness in the parables of the great supper (Luke 14) and the marriage of the king's son (Matthew 22). Christ, the supreme Wisdom, has ‘builded His house’ by taking man's flesh at His Incarnation, and thus rearing for Himself a ‘temple of the Holy Ghost’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>); and also by building for Himself a ‘spiritual house’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm">1Peter 2:5</a>), ‘the house of God, which is the church of the living God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1Timothy 3:15</a>) … In the previous chapter Christ’s work as Creator was described; now He is set forth as Regenerator of mankind. . . .” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 9:1-2).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>

<p>The wise will accept Jesus’ invitation to eternal life and eternal fellowship<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has a place in heaven ready for all with faith in Him</u>. Yahweh revealed that “<em>Wisdom has built her house.</em>” (Prov. 9:1a). As a symbol of completeness, Yahweh’s house is “<em>carved out her seven pillars</em>.” (Prov. 9:1b). This foreshadowed the completed perfect place in heaven that Jesus has prepared for all believers. “In My Father’s house are many rooms; if that were not so, I would have told you, because I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will take you to Myself, so that where I am, there you also will be.” (Jo. 14:2-3). “And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, ‘Behold, the tabernacle of God is among the people, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,”’ (Rev. 21:2-3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has prepared a banquet in heaven for His Church</u>. Yahweh also states that wisdom “<em>has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table</em>;” (Prov. 9:2). This foreshadows the great wedding banquet between Jesus and His bride, the Church. “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who held a wedding feast for his son. And he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come. Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, ‘Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened cattle are all butchered and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast!”’ (Matt. 22:2-4; Lk. 14:16-24). “Let’s rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His bride has prepared herself. It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Then he said to me, ‘Write: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.’’ And he said to me, ‘These are the true words of God.’” (Rev. 19:7-9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has also prepared a house inside every believer for the Holy Spirit</u>. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He also provides a house within you for the Holy Spirit to dwell and guide you. “So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.” (Eph. 2:19-22). The act of dining together is a sign of fellowship, something Jesus seeks out with every person (Rev. 3:20). Through the Spirit, He offers His fellowship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>If you reject Jesus’ offers of communion, you cannot dwell with Him</u>. The banquet also foreshadows the communion that Jesus offers through His body and His blood. Those who refuse His offer, can have no part of His eternal inheritance. “So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.” (Jo. 6:53-54; Matt. 26:26-28).</p></li>

<h2 id="evangelism-jesus-calls-upon-believers-to-share-his-invitation.-prov.-93."><strong>2. <u>Evangelism: Jesus Calls Upon Believers to Share His Invitation</u>. Prov. 9:3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has commissioned every believer to share the Good News of His invitation</u>. Yahweh calls for every believer to share His offer of an eternal home with His eternal fellowship. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>she has sent out her attendants, she calls out from the tops of the heights of the city:”</em> (Prov. 9:3). “By them are represented the apostles and preachers and ministers, who go forth to win souls for Christ.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 9:3).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-9/media/image5.jpg" style="width:5.97904in;height:2.19034in" alt="Evangelize" /></p>
<p>Jesus calls upon all believers to evangelize as part of the Great Commission<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus commands His servants to invite nonbelievers to His banquet</u>. In Jesus’ parable of the wedding feast, He calls upon every believer to share His invitation. “So go to the main roads, and invite whomever you find there to the wedding feast.” (Matt. 22:9). “and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, because everything is ready now.”’ (Lk. 14:17). This is also Jesus’ Great Commission. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. <strong><sup>19</sup></strong> Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”’ (Matt. 28:18-20). When you obey Jesus and plant the seeds of faith, the Spirit will speak to nonbelievers to encourage them to accept Jesus’ banquet invitation. “The Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who hears say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires, take the water of life without cost.” (Rev. 22:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>David made it a life-long habit to share his testimony and praise with others</u>. As our example, David proclaimed that he would share his praise and testimony to all God’s peoples: “I have proclaimed good news of righteousness in the great congregation; behold, I will not restrain my lips, LORD, You know.” (Ps. 40:9). “Come and hear, all who fear God, and I will tell of what He has done for my soul.” (Ps. 66:16). “I still declare Your wondrous deeds.” (Ps. 71:16). “I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise You.” (Ps. 22:18). “My foot stands on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.” (Ps. 26:12). “I will give You thanks in the great congregation; I will praise You among a mighty people.” (Ps. 35:18). “I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will advise you with My eye upon you.” (Ps. 32:8). David’s testimony was a light of hope for others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also wants you to share your testimony to evangelize others</u>. Jesus also wants you to share your testimony to let others know what He has done for you: “And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.” (Mk. 5:20). When you accept Jesus, His light shines within you as a beacon for others: “<sup>14 </sup>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; <sup>15 </sup>nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. <sup>16 </sup>Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16). Are you sharing Jesus’ light inside you with your testimony of hope?</p></li>

<h2 id="repentance-jesus-invitation-is-available-to-all-who-repent.-prov.-94-6."><strong>3. <u>Repentance: Jesus’ Invitation is Available to All Who Repent</u>. Prov. 9:4-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ invitation to eternal salvation and fellowship requires your repentance of all sin</u>. Yahweh calls upon every person to repent, turn away from sin, and seek His fellowship. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>‘<em>Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!’ To him who lacks understanding she says, <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>‘Come, eat of my food and drink of the wine I have mixed. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Abandon your foolishness and live, and proceed in the way of understanding</em>.’” (Prov. 9:4-6). “The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Savior came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see …  It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 9:1-12).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Old Testament prophets all called upon sinners to repent and return to God</u>. Yahweh’s call is universal and not limited to the educated (Pro. 9:4-5). All are called upon to “<em>Abandon your foolishness and live, and proceed in the way of understanding</em>.’” (Prov. 9:6). God’s call to repentance is repeated throughout the Old Testament. “Let the wicked abandon his way, and the unrighteous person his thoughts; and let him return to the LORD, and He will have compassion on him, and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.” (Is. 55:7). ‘“But if the wicked person turns from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall certainly live; he shall not die. All his offenses which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live. Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘rather than that he would turn from his ways and live?”’ (Ezek. 18:21-23).</p></li>

<p>Jesus’ invitation begins with a call to repentance<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus, wisdom incarnate, calls upon all sinners to repent</u>. The New Testament reveals that our God-given wisdom comes through Jesus. “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, <em>who became to us wisdom from God</em>, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). He calls upon all sinners to show the wisdom to repent of their sins. “I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.” (Lk. 5:32). “And hearing this, Jesus said to them, ‘It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”’ (Mk. 2:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>There is joy in heaven for every sinner who accepts Jesus’ invitation</u>. Jesus does not want any to perish. “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9). Thus, He came to save the lost. “For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Lk. 19:10; Matt. 18:11). “For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.” (Jo. 3:17). “If anyone hears My teachings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.” (Jo. 12:47). There is also a celebration in heaven for every sinner who repents. “In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” (Lk. 15:10).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="being-spirit-led-let-the-spirit-guide-you-in-serving-jesus.-prov.-97-9."><strong>4. <u>Being Spirit-Led: Let the Spirit Guide You in Serving Jesus</u>. Prov. 9:7-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus calls on every believer to seek His wisdom and let Him guide where to serve Him</u>. Yahweh calls upon every believer to turn to Him to know where and how to serve Him. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight</em>.” (Prov. 9:7-9). “It will not work to reprove a man that has his head turned toward the unrighteous things of the world; he will not only hate you for what you are trying to do but will also scorn you. That does not hold true for a man that is wise; if you rebuke him he will love you, because you will save him from the error of his way.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 9:8).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not squander Jesus’ blessings on those who reject Him</u>. Every person deserves the right to receive Jesus’ invitation to eternal life. But there are many who refuse to accept Jesus’ invitation out of pride and foolishness. Thus, Jesus calls upon believers to not squander His blessings on the foolish. “But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say, ‘Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’” (Lk. 10:10-11). “And whoever does not receive you nor listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.” (Matt. 10:14; Mk. 6:11). “Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.” (Matt. 7:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus spoke in parables to reach those with hardened hearts</u>. Just as Solomon used a parable to foreshadow the message of the Gospel, Jesus spoke in parables because there are many with hardened hearts. “Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.” (Matt. 13:13). When people reject the Good News, pray for Jesus to soften their hearts.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let the Holy Spirit guide you on how and where to serve Jesus</u>. Although there are many who will reject Jesus’ invitation, there are also many who are ready to receive it. “And He was saying to them, ‘The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.’” (Lk. 10:2; Matt. 9:37-38). The need to know where to direct your time, talent, and treasure is also urgent. “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together.” (Jo. 4:35-36). To know where to direct your resources in the face of an urgent need, you must pray, read the Word, and be responsive when the Holy Spirit directs you with Jesus’ wisdom. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Invest Jesus’ wisdom in those with receptive hearts, and they will grow in their faith</u>. Yahweh revealed that the wise, who are willing to accept instruction and rebuke, will grow in their God-given wisdom when a believer invests in these persons. “<em>Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight</em>.” (Prov. 9:9). This repeated Solomon’s initial Proverb. “A wise person will hear and increase in learning, and a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel,” (Prov. 1:5). Jesus also revealed that He will bless the wise with greater gifts and responsibilities when they accept His wisdom. “For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.” (Matt. 13:12; 25:29; Mk. 4:25; Lk. 8:18; 19:26).</p></li>

<h2 id="fearing-jesus-wisdom-comes-from-jesus-and-is-available-to-all-who-seek-him-and-hate-what-he-defines-as-evil-in-his-word.-prov.-910."><strong>5. <u>Fearing Jesus: Wisdom Comes from Jesus and is Available to All Who Seek Him and Hate What He Defines as Evil in His Word</u>. Prov. 9:10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>To be wise and understand Jesus’ call, you must cling to what is good and reject evil</u>. To walk in Yahweh’s fellowship, believers must also reject evil and cling to what is good. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding</em>.” (Prov. 9:10). The wise person is distinguished from the foolish person by whether they fear Yahweh. “Though Proverbs is a book that focuses on practical life, it is founded on this important principle: wisdom begins with a right relationship with God … This is a real <strong>fear</strong>, but in the sense of awe and reverence. It honors God as He really is – holy, just, and creator of all. It is not a cowering or servile fear, but it is a kind of fear nonetheless.” (David Guzik on Prov. 9:10).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by hating what He defines as evil</u>. The prologue to Proverbs begins and ends with Yahweh’s revelation that “<sup>7 </sup><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction</em>.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:10). The fear of Yahweh is defined as “hating” what He calls evil (Prov. 8:13). Some of the many examples include avoiding evil (Prov. 2:14-18), avoiding evil companions (Prov. 1:10-19; 4:17; 23:6-8; 27:19), avoid drunkenness (Prov. 20:1; 31:5), controlling one’s tongue (Prov. 10:19-20; 11:9; 11:13; 13:3; 15:1,4; 17:9), avoiding unfair business practices (Prov. 11:1; 16:11; 20:10), honoring your marriage (Prov. 11:29; 14:1; 19:13; 21:19), having self-control (Prov. 16:32; 25:8), and having integrity (Prov. 2:7). Isaiah declared that the promised Messiah would fulfill these definitions. “The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom</em> and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, <em>the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD</em>.” (Is. 11:2).</p></li>

<p>Fear Jesus by hating what He calls evil and clinging to what He calls good<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fear of Jesus can guard your heart from the temptations of your flesh</u>. Without the fear of the Lord, a person’s sinful desires can overpower their God-given wisdom and knowledge. Thus, a person who fears God also guards his or her heart (Prov. 4:23). Solomon’s failure to guard his heart later led to his idolatry and other serious sins. His failures also likely prompted him to write the book of Ecclesiastes.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by staying on His narrow path</u>. Part of the fear of the Lord includes knowing that there are adverse consequences if you fail to stay on Jesus’ narrow path. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>True wisdom comes from Jesus</u>. Part of responding to wisdom’s call is also having the discernment to reject false worldly wisdom. “<em>For the LORD gives wisdom</em>; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “Wisdom and might are with Him; advice and understanding belong to Him.” (Job. 12:13). “Daniel said, ‘May the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him.”’ (Dan. 2:20). Jesus <em>“became to us wisdom from God</em>, …,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Thus, part of fearing Jesus includes praying for the discernment to reject the devil’s counterfeit wisdom.</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-blessings-blessings-await-all-who-accept-his-wisdom.-prov.-911-12."><strong>6. <u>Jesus’ Blessings: Blessings Await all Who Accept His Wisdom</u>. Prov. 9:11-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those with the wisdom to accept Jesus’ call receive blessings, including eternal life</u>. Yahweh promises many blessings for those with the wisdom to accept His invitation. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>For by me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you scoff, you alone will suffer from it</em>.” (Prov. 9:11-12). “For by me thy days shall be multiplied,.... These are the words of Wisdom, and contain a reason and argument why her call and advice in the preceding verses should be listened unto, since she gives long life to her followers. She is a tree of life unto them, the author and giver of spiritual and eternal life; by means of her bread and her wine spiritual life is maintained, promoted, and preserved; and length of days, for ever and ever, is the gift of her right hand;” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 9:11).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When your faith leads to obedience, Jesus will “prolong” your life</u>.  Yahweh promised Solomon that He would “prolong” his days if Solomon kept His Ten Commandments and statutes. “And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, <em>then I will prolong your days</em>.” (1 Kgs. 3:13). Those who follow Yahweh’s wisdom are also promised, “<em>For by me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you.</em>” (Prov. 9:11). Similar promises exist for those who follow the Ten Commandments out of love (and not obligation). “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> My son, do not forget my teaching, but have your heart comply with my commandments; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you … Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor<em>.</em>” (Prov. 3: 1-2, 16). “You shall walk entirely in the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and that it may be well for you, and that <em>you may prolong your days</em> in the land which you will possess.” (Dt. 5:33). “. . .  keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and <em>that your days may be prolonged</em>.”  (Dt. 6:2).  “<em>so that you may prolong your days on the land</em> . . .”  (Dt. 11:9).  Similar promises also appear in the Psalms. “I will satisfy him with <em>a long life</em>, and show him My salvation.” (Ps. 91:16). “He asked for life from You, You gave it to him, <em>length of days</em> forever and ever.” (Ps. 21:4). The Fourth Commandment also includes a promise to prolong the lives of those who honor their parents. “Those who honor their earthly father and mother and their eternal Father will be blessed with a prolonged life:  “Honor your father and your mother, <em>that your days may be prolonged</em> in the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God gives you.”  (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16; Eph. 6:2-3).  These promises do not mean that you will live until you are old.  You could die at any moment.  But Jesus promises to “prolong” your life when your faith leads to obedience.  You may have an extra minute, a week, a year, a decade, or some other increment of time added to your lifetime.  Only when you get to heaven will you learn of the amount of time that Jesus has added to your life out of loving grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ promise of a prolonged life also includes eternal life</u>. Your salvation is not tied to your obedience. But when you have the faith to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you will also receive eternal life, the ultimate fulfillment of a prolonged life. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” (Jo. 3:36). “The world is passing away and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God continues to live forever.” (1 Jo. 2:17). “And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.” (1 Jo. 5:11). Thus, there are many reasons to follow Jesus. The wise will believe in Him and praise Him.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>You will reap from your decision to sow the wisdom of the Spirit or deeds of the flesh</u>. Yahweh’s exhortation to choose wisdom ends with a statement that each person will reap with the benefit or consequences of their decision. “<em><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you scoff, you alone will suffer from it</em>.” (Prov. 9:12). “[T]his verse aligns with the fundamental theme in Proverbs where we encounter contrasting paths. One leads to life and fulfillment, while the other leads to destruction. It serves as a reminder that we have a decision to make whenever we encounter wisdom or folly.” (Pastor David on Prov. 9:12).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> “For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:8). “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.” (Jo. 6:63).</p></li>

Prov. 9:13-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Jesus and accept the devil’s call face judgment</u>. Yahweh warns all persons to reject the spiritual harlot’s false banquet that offers only suffering and eternal death. “<strong><sup>13</sup></strong> <em>A woman of foolishness is boisterous, she has a lack of understanding and knows nothing. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat by the high places of the city, <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their paths: <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>‘Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,’ and to him who lacks understanding she says, <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>‘Stolen water is sweet; and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.’ <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol</em>.” (Prov. 9:13-18). “<em>The woman Folly</em> elevates the adulteress from the heretofore historical register to the symbolic register in the persona of Folly. The addition of ‘woman’ connects personified Folly to the adulteress with whom she shares many traits. Both are <em>turbulent</em> (or ‘unruly’, see 7:11), lustful lovers panting after the uncommitted youth’s body (7:13; 9:17), and so both proposition him (7:7, 18; 9:15-16). Both are married (7:19; 9:17) and, above all, deadly (2:18-19; 5:23; 7:27; 9:18).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 9:13-15).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The woman of foolishness likely foreshadows the spiritual harlot, who leads many astray</u>. Because the beginning of Proverbs 9 clearly foreshadows Jesus’ Gospel, it is reasonable to conclude that the woman of foolishness foreshadows the great spiritual harlot in the book of Revelations. “Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, ‘Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of sexual immorality, and those who live on the earth became drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality’…. The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls, holding in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her sexual immorality, and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery: ‘Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.’ And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly.” (Rev. 17:1-2, 4-6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be wary of Satan’s snares</u>. Satan offers false enticements, with stolen water representing an adulterous pleasure. ‘“<em>Stolen water is sweet; and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</em>”’ (Prov. 9:17). This is Satan’s false banquet. Sin can be pleasurable for a season (Heb. 11:25). But the person who follows the woman of folly adopts the path leading to Sheol. “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol</em>.” (Prov. 9:18). Proverbs 2, 5 and 7 contain similar warnings. “For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks lead to the dead;” (Prov. 2:18). “Her feet go down to death, her steps take hold of Sheol.” (Prov. 5:5). “Her house is the way to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.” (Prov. 7:27). The King James Version and the New King James Version substitute the word “hell” for the word for “Sheol.” (<span dir="rtl">שְׁא֣וֹל</span>). Solomon also warned in Ecclesiastes. “And I discovered as more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her.” (Ecc. 7:26).</p></li>

<p>Stay on Jesus’ narrow path and be wary of Satan’s path leading to destruction<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>For those who reject Jesus and refuse to repent, the wages of sin are death</u>. Those who reject Jesus and refuse to repent of sin face judgment. “Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death … For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:21, 23). “For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were brought to light by the Law, were at work in the parts of our body to bear fruit for death.” (Ro. 7:5). “Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, indecent behavior, … envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Gal. 5:19, 21). “For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:8). “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor those habitually drunk, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Cor. 6:9-10). “But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:14-15). “But for the cowardly, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and sexually immoral persons, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.” (Rev. 21:8). Thus, each person must reject Satan’s path of folly and adopt Jesus’ path of wisdom leading to eternal life.</p></li>
