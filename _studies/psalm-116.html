<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 116 continues the “Hallel” (<span dir="rtl">הַלֵּל</span>) praises that the Jews offered in connection with the Passover Seder (Jerome Creach on Ps. 116).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As its climax, “Psalm 116 celebrates Yahweh as the God who raises from the dead.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 116).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Along with Psalm 115, Jesus most likely sang this psalm “on the night of His betrayal and arrest (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+26.30&amp;t=NKJV">Matthew 26:30</a> and <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+14.26&amp;t=NKJV">Mark 14:26</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 116).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Jesus sang this psalm before He willingly submitted Himself to be our sacrifice on the cross. What can believers do to express their gratitude? The Apostle Paul answered this question by urging believers to present themselves “as a living and holy sacrifice” for Jesus (Ro. 12:1). Psalm 116 offers important lessons for how believers can fulfill this calling to Jesus. For your entire life, this includes offering Jesus your full: (1) love, (2) faith, (3) gratitude, (4) praise, (5) faithfulness, (6) sacrifice, and (7) evangelism.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist declared his love for God and his commitment to call upon God for as long as he lived. For as long as you live, Jesus also wants you to love Him with all your heart and call upon Him. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist declared that He would turn to God to save his life from death and the terrors of Sheol. As long as you live, Jesus also wants you to have faith in Him as your Savior. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist credited God with grace, compassion, and saving him. As long as you live, Jesus also wants you to be grateful for His grace, compassion, and salvation. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist praised God for rescuing his soul and allowing him to live. As long as you live, Jesus also deserves your praise and worship for your salvation. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist promised to pay his vows to God. As long as you live, Jesus also desires that you faithfully serve and obey Him. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist declared that he was a slave for God, and he would offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. As long as you live, Jesus also desires that you gratefully sacrifice for Him. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist proclaimed that he would pay his vows publicly for all to see. As long as you live, Jesus also desires that you publicly share your faith and testimony to evangelize others.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>A life-long walk with Jesus begins with a sincere love for Him</u>. Out of a profound love and gratitude for God’s answered prayers, the psalmist vowed to call on God for as long as he lived: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>I love the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, because He hears My voice and my pleas. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Because He has inclined His ear to me, therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live</em>.” (Ps. 116:1-2). “<em>I love the LORD.</em> A blessed declaration: every believer ought to be able to declare without the slightest hesitation, ‘I love the Lord.’ It was required under the law, but was never produced in the heart of man except by the grace of God, and upon gospel principles. It is a great thing to say ‘I love the Lord’; for the sweetest of all graces and the surest of all evidences of salvation is love.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 116:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Serve and obey Jesus out of love or your service and obedience will not likely last<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God expects believers to follow Him out of love, not obligation.</u> When Moses gave God’s Law, he advised that their obedience needed to be rooted in a love for God or it would not last. “And you shall <em>love the LORD</em> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” (Dt. 6:5). “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and <em>love Him</em>, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,” (Dt. 10:12). “You shall therefore <em>love the LORD</em> your God, and always keep His directive, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.” (Dt. 11:1). The Jews drifted from following God’s Law because they obeyed out of obligation, not love. The same improper motivation will also cause believers today to drift away in their walk.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Loving God is the greatest commandment</u>. When asked to identify the greatest of the Ten Commandments, Jesus revealed that it is to love God: ‘“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?’ And He said to him, ‘You shall <em>love the LORD</em> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’” (Matt. 22:36-37; Mk. 12:28-31; Lk. 10:26-27). If you love Jesus, you will desire to obey Him out of devotion, not obligation. Conversely, your disobedience is also a sign that your love for Him has grown cold. “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” (Jo. 14:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Declare your love for God as a witness to others</u>. The psalmist followed God’s Law by declaring his love for God (Ps. 116:1). As our example, David also followed God’s Law by declaring his love for God: “A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song on the day that the LORD rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said, ‘<em>I love You</em>, LORD, my strength.’” (Ps. 18:1). What did his love for God mean to David? It meant that his soul thirsted to be with God. “A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. God, You are my God; I shall be watching for You; <em>my soul thirsts for You</em>, my flesh yearns for You, in a dry and exhausted land where there is no water.” (Ps. 63:1). If you love God, you will feel a need for His presence the same way you need water to live.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faith-as-long-as-you-live-have-faith-in-jesus-as-your-savior.-ps.-1163-4."><strong>2. <u>Faith: As Long as You Live, Have Faith in Jesus as Your Savior</u>. Ps. 116:3-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Have faith that Jesus’ atoning death made your salvation possible</u>. The psalmist expressed his faith and gratitude that God saved him from death and the terrors of Sheol: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The snares of death encompassed me and the terrors of Sheol came upon me; I found distress and sorrow. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Then I called upon the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>: ‘Please, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, save my life!</em>’” (Ps. 116:3-4). “When a poor sinner is awakened to a sense of his state, and fears that he must soon sink under the just wrath of God, then he finds trouble and sorrow. But let all such call upon the Lord to deliver their souls, and they will find him gracious and true to his promise. Neither ignorance nor guilt will hinder their salvation, when they put their trust in the Lord. Let us all speak of God as we have found him; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? It is of his mercies that we are not consumed. Let those who labour and are heavy laden come to him, that they may find rest to their souls; and if at all drawn from their rest, let them haste to return, remembering how bountifully the Lord has dealt with them.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 116:1-9).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Without a means for atonement, all would face the terror of eternal life without God</u>. The psalmist expressed the fear and terror of a death where he might be separated from God (Ps. 116:3-4). David once expressed a similar fear of an eternal death and separation from God. “The ropes of death encompassed me, and the torrents of destruction terrified me. The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.” (Ps. 18:4-5). “My heart is in anguish within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.” (Ps. 55:4). Without a means for atonement, all would face the terrors of an eternal life separated from God. “Indeed, there is not a righteous person on earth who always does good and does not ever sin.” (Ecc. 7:20; Ro. 3:23). “For the wages of sin is death, . . .” (Ro. 6:23a). Thus, those who reject Jesus’ offer of atonement for their sins face a life of eternal darkness where God’s light is missing: “And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Only faith can save you from an eternal death where you would be separated from God</u>. Although David knew that he was a sinner, he had faith that God would provide a way for his soul to be with God in heaven. “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “LORD, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit.” (Ps. 30:3). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 86:13). “He sent His word and healed them, and saved them from their destruction.” (Ps. 107:20). Job was a hero of the faith because He believed that he had an Advocate and a Redeemer in heaven who would save his soul. “Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.” (Job 16:19). “Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.” (Job 19:25). Jonah also professed faith that God had saved his soul from an eternal death. “and he said, ‘I called out of my distress to the LORD, and He answered me. I called for help from the depth of Sheol; You heard my voice.’ . . . I descended to the base of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, but You have brought up my life from the pit, LORD my God.” (Jonah 2:2, 6).</p></li>

<p>Share with others how Jesus delivered you from death and bondage to sin<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Have faith in Jesus Christ, and you will live with Him forever</u>. Jesus is the promised Advocate and Redeemer who makes eternal life possible. All that is required is faith in Him as Lord and Savior. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.” (Jo. 6:40). “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; the one who believes in Me will live, even if he dies,”’ (Jo. 11:25). Thus, Jesus is worthy of a lifetime of faith and commitment to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Without faith your works are meaningless</u>. Without faith, nothing that you do for Jesus has any real value: “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6). Thus, your service should be the fruit of your faith.</p></li>

<h2 id="gratitude-as-long-as-you-live-be-grateful-for-jesus-grace.-ps.-1165-7."><strong>3. <u>Gratitude: As Long as You Live, Be Grateful for Jesus’ Grace</u>. Ps. 116:5-7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ abundant grace and mercy have given you many reasons to give thanks to Him</u>. The psalmist expressed his gratitude that God had shown him compassion, saved him, and granted him peace: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Gracious is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and righteous; yes, our God is compassionate. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watches over the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has dealt generously with you</em>.” (Ps. 116:5-7). This pointed to Jesus. “Gracious is the Lord, .... So the psalmist found him, calling upon him; so he is in Christ, the author and giver of all grace, to help in time of need.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 116:5).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> “<strong>Gracious is the LORD, and righteous</strong>: In light of his deliverance through answered prayer, the psalmist praised the <strong>gracious</strong>, <strong>righteous</strong>, and <strong>merciful</strong> character of God. Before His obedient surrender to the ordeal of His suffering and crucifixion, Jesus sang these words with His disciples (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+26.30&amp;t=NKJV">Matthew 26:30</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+14.26&amp;t=NKJV">Mark 14:26</a>). He testified to the truth that God was <strong>gracious</strong>, <strong>righteous</strong>, and <strong>merciful</strong> before, during, and after His ordeal.” (David Guzik on Ps. 116:5).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s compassion and love for you</u>. The psalmist gave thanks for God’s grace, compassion, and salvation. (Ps. 116:5-6). God’s holy attributes allowed his soul to experience eternal peace (Ps. 116:7). God is also loving, compassionate, merciful, long-suffering, and filled with grace to save you. “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). “But You, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abundant in mercy and truth.” (Ps. 86:15). “The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in mercy.” (Ps. 103:8). Thus, He is worthy of a lifetime of gratitude from you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ death allowed God’s grace to pour out upon you</u>. God’s grace is available to you through faith in Jesus as your Lord and Savior. “But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.” (Acts 15:11). “being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,” (Ro. 3:24). “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.” (2 Cor. 8:9). “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.” (2 Cor. 13:14). “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people,” (Titus 2:11). Again, He is worthy of your gratitude.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ atoning death also offers peace for your soul</u>. The psalmist professed confidence that God would allow his soul to find peace. “<em><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has dealt generously with you</em>.” (Ps. 116:7). Jesus quoted from this verse when He offered eternal peace for all who believe in Him. “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and <em>you will find rest for your souls</em>.” (Matt. 11:29). You can respond by being a “living sacrifice” of gratitude (Ro. 12:1).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="praise-as-long-as-you-live-offer-jesus-praise-and-worship.-ps.-1168-10."><strong>4. <u>Praise: As Long as You Live, Offer Jesus Praise and Worship</u>. Ps. 116:8-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for rescuing your soul from eternal death and offering you eternal life</u>. The psalmist offered heart-felt praise for God for saving his soul from death and allowing him to one day walk before God in the land of the living: “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>I shall walk before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the land of the living. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>I believed when I said, ‘I am greatly afflicted.’ <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>I said in my alarm, ‘All people are liars.</em>’” (Ps. 116:8-10). The Apostle Paul later quoted from Psalm 116:10. “<em>I have believed — </em>God’s promise of deliverance; <em>therefore have I spoken — </em>What I have now said; or, I have firmly believed, and trusted in God’s almighty power, and ever watchful providence, and therefore have addressed my prayer unto him with confidence in my greatest dangers and distresses. In this, or a similar sense, this clause is quoted by St. Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>, with application to himself and his fellow-ministers, who, though they were exposed everywhere to sufferings for Christ’s sake, and were even in danger of being put to death wherever they came; yet were neither ashamed nor afraid to own him, because they confided in the promise he had made them of a blessed resurrection.” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Ps. 116:10).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The psalmists praised God for their salvation</u>. As our example, David and other psalmists repeatedly praised God for rescuing their souls from an eternal afterlife away from His presence: “You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever.” (Ps. 16:11). “I certainly believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.” (Ps. 27:13). “For You have saved my soul from death, indeed my feet from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the living.” (Ps. 56:13). “God is to us a God of salvation; and to GOD the Lord belong ways of escape from death.” (Ps. 68:20). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 86:13). “I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the LORD.” (Ps. 118:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have the faith to praise Jesus, even when others mock you</u>. The Apostle Paul relied upon Psalm 110:10 to praise God in the face of those who might have killed him for his beliefs. “But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written: ‘I believed, therefore I spoke,’ we also believe, therefore we also speak,” (2 Cor. 4:13). If you are mocked or persecuted because of your faith, Jesus will reward you in heaven. “Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.” (Matt. 5:11-12). “If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory, and of God, rests upon you.” (1 Pet. 4:14). Thus, Jesus deserves a lifetime of praise from you. This is true even if you are mocked, attacked, or persecuted for your faith in Him.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faithfulness-as-long-as-you-live-faithfully-serve-and-obey.-ps.-11612-14."><strong>5. <u>Faithfulness: As Long as You Live, Faithfully Serve and Obey</u>. Ps. 116:12-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, faithfully fulfill your vows to Jesus</u>. Overcome with the knowledge that he had nothing to offer to repay God, the psalmist promised to faithfully fulfill his vows before God: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>What shall I repay to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for all His benefits to me? <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>I will pay my vows to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; may it be in the presence of all His people!</em>” (Ps. 116:12-14). The psalmists’ statements again pointed to Jesus. “Originally ‘cup of salvation’ probably referred to a libation offering (see Exodus 29:40). But later tradition associated the cup with the portion of Passover in which four cups of wine are offered. Psalm 116 (along with Psalm 115 and 117-118) is read in connection with the fourth cup. For Christians the cup came to refer to the salvation found in Jesus Christ who reinterpreted this element by identifying the cup with his sacrificial death and the new covenant that came from it (Matthew 26:27-28; Mark 14:23-24; Luke 22:20).” (Jerome Creach on Ps. 116).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>We have nothing to repay Jesus for His sacrifice</u>. The psalmist professed amazement that God would save him when he had nothing to offer to repay God: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>What shall I repay to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for all His benefits to me?</em>” (Ps. 116:12). “No one can by any means redeem another or give God a ransom for him—” (Ps. 49:7). “For this is what the LORD says: ‘You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.”’ (Is. 52:3). Jesus also made clear that there is nothing that we can pay through our own works to redeem our souls: “For what could a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Mk. 8:37). “For what thanks can we give to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,” (1 Thess. 3:9). “knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,” (1 Pet. 1:18). If you could be saved through your works, Jesus died for no purpose (Gal. 2:21). Thus, He is worthy of a lifetime of devotion.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, seek to be in communion with Jesus to properly serve and obey Him</u>. The psalmist stated that he would respond to God his Redeemer by drinking “<em>the cup of salvation.</em>” (Ps. 116:13). “The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.” (Ps. 16:5). This pointed to the blood of Jesus that you can drink to stay in communion with Him. “And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, ‘This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant in My blood.”’ (Lk. 22:20; Matt. 26:28; Mk. 14:24). “Is the cup of blessing which we bless not a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is the bread which we break not a sharing in the body of Christ?” (1 Cor. 10:16). When you are in communion with Jesus, you can best receive His instruction through prayer, reading the Word, and the Holy Spirit to serve Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, faithfully serve and obey Jesus</u>. Having nothing that he could offer to pay God for his salvation, the psalmists stated that he would, at a minimum, faithfully keep his promises to serve and obey God. “<em><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>I will pay my vows to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; may it be in the presence of all His people!</em>” (Ps. 116:14). “From You comes my praise in the great assembly; <em>I shall pay my vows</em> before those who fear Him.” (Ps. 22:25). “Offer God a sacrifice of thanksgiving and <em>pay your vows</em> to the Most High;” (Ps. 50:14). Whatever you have committed to doing for Jesus, be faithful in fulfilling your promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, faithfully serve and obey Jesus as a living sacrifice</u>. Although you have nothing to offer to pay Jesus, you can respond by becoming a “living sacrifice” for Him. “Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). Out of devotion, you are also called upon to obey Jesus: “Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of that same one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” (Ro. 6:16). Is the fruit of obedience evident in your life?</p></li>

<h2 id="sacrifice-as-long-as-you-live-gratefully-sacrifice-for-jesus.-ps.-11615-17."><strong>6. <u>Sacrifice: As Long as You Live, Gratefully Sacrifice for Jesus</u>. Ps. 116:15-17.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, become a bondservant to Jesus and offer sacrifices of thanksgiving</u>. Unable to repay God, the psalmist declared himself a slave to Him, and he promised to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and to call upon Him: “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>Precious in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the death of His godly ones. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I surely am Your slave, I am Your slave, the son of Your female slave, You have unfastened my restraints. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>I will offer You a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and call upon the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Ps. 116:15-17). Although saved from a near death experience, the psalmist was willing to sacrifice for and even die for God. Any person who is killed for their faith is deeply precious in God’s sight. “It is not a matter of indifference to God, when and under what circumstances each of his saints dies. Rather, it is a matter of deep concern to him. ‘In him are the issues of life and death’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm">Psalm 68:20</a>), and he appoints to each man the day and attendant circumstances of his demise.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 116:15).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Out of gratitude, always be willing to sacrifice and deny yourself for Jesus<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Show your love for Jesus by being willing to deny yourself and sacrifice to serve Him</u>. The psalmist declared that he would thankfully remain with his Master and serve as a freed slave, “<em>O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I surely am Your slave,</em>” (Ps. 116:16). “<em>I am Your servant</em>; . . .” (Ps. 119:125). Paul also called himself a freed slave or a “bondservant” to Jesus: “Paul, <em>a bond-servant</em> of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,” (Ro. 1:1). The fruit of your faith should also include a willingness to sacrifice for Jesus when called upon to do so. “Then Jesus said to His disciples, ‘If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.”’ (Matt. 16:24). “For you have been called for this purpose, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in His steps,” (1 Pet. 2:21). “strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, ‘It is through many tribulations that we must enter the kingdom of God.”’ (Acts 14:22). A rich man told Jesus that he had faithfully obeyed God. But he walked away from Jesus with sadness because he was unwilling to part with his belongings when called upon him to do so (Matt. 19:20-22). Jesus may not call upon you to sacrifice anything more than the things of the flesh. But you should be willing to sacrifice more if called upon to do so.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, freely make thanksgiving offerings to Jesus</u>. Even when you are not called upon to do so, you can offer voluntary gifts, tithes, charity, or service to show your gratitude to Jesus. “And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me, and <em>I will offer sacrifices</em> in His tent with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.” (Ps. 27:6). “<em>Offer God a sacrifice of thanksgiving</em> . . . ;” (Ps. 50:14a). “They shall also <em>offer sacrifices of thanksgiving</em>, and tell of His works with joyful singing.” (Ps. 107:22). “<em>Be pleased to accept the voluntary offerings</em> of my mouth, LORD, . . .” (Ps. 119:108a). “Through Him then, let’s continually offer up <em>a sacrifice of praise to God</em>, that is, the fruit of lips praising His name.” (Heb. 13:15). Out of love and devotion, will you offer Jesus the best of your time, talent, and treasure?</p></li>

<h2 id="evangelism-as-long-as-you-live-publicly-share-your-faith.-ps.-11618-19."><strong>7. <u>Evangelism: As Long as You Live, Publicly Share Your Faith</u>. Ps. 116:18-19.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Share your testimony and faith before others</u>. Out of gratitude, the psalmist committed to publicly paying his vows for all to see: “<em><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>I will pay my vows to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, may it be in the presence of all His people, <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>in the courtyards of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span> house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem! Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 116:18-19). The psalmist would “pay his vow to praise the LORD in the assembly and in offering the sacrifice of praise provide for the communal feast of the worshipers.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 116:17-19).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This is also an exhortation to boldly proclaim your testimony and publicly praise Jesus. “Be bold, be bold, ye servants of the Lord, in sounding forth the praises of your God. Go into presses of people; and in the midst of them praise the Lord . . . Assuredly Christ will shew himself as forward to confess you, as you are, or can be to confess him. Mt 10:32. This holy boldness is the ready way to glory.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 116:18).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your praises and testimony be a witness to encourage others</u>. David and other psalmists also proclaimed that they would praise God as a witness for others to see. “I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; <em>in the midst of the assembly I will praise You</em> . . . From You comes <em>my praise in the great assembly</em>; I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him.” (Ps. 22:22, 25). “I will give You thanks in the great congregation; <em>I will praise You among a mighty people</em>.” (Ps. 35:18). “I have proclaimed good news of righteousness <em>in the great congregation</em>; behold, I will not restrain my lips, LORD, You know. I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from <em>the great congregation</em>.” (Ps. 40:9-10). “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Tell of His glory among the nations</em>, His wonderful deeds among all the peoples.” (Ps. 96:3). “I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the LORD.” (Ps. 118:17). Thus, God always meant for the Jews to be a light to the gentile nations: “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” (Is. 49:6). Evangelism therefore had its roots in the Old Testament.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus also wants you to share your testimony and evangelize others</u>. Jesus also wants you to share your testimony to let others know what He has done for you: “And he went away and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.” (Mk. 5:20). When you accept Jesus, His light shines within you as a beacon for others: “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16). As part of Jesus’ Great Commission, He urges believers to share His offer of salvation: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit teaching them to follow all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”  (Matt. 28:18-20).  Are you sharing the good news: Jesus’ offer of salvation with nonbelievers?</p></li>
