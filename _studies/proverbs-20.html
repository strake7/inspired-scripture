<h1 id="proverbs-20-lessons-for-honoring-jesus-through-holy-conduct"><strong>Proverbs 20: Lessons for Honoring Jesus Through Holy Conduct</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, Solomon reveals lessons for holy conduct that honors Yahweh. Yahweh, the great I AM, is another name for Jesus (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). Jesus commands His people to be holy because He is holy (Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2; 1 Pet. 1:16). Holy conduct that honors Jesus should include: (1) restraint, (2) being diligent for Him, (3) following His righteousness, (4) being spiritually alert to deception, (5) following His truth, (6) trusting Him, and (7) obedience.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one through three, Solomon provides three different examples for how believers should restrain the desires of their flesh. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you should also restrain any unholy desires of your flesh. <u>Second</u>, in verses four and five, Solomon provides two examples for how believers should be diligent in their work. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you should also be diligent in serving wherever He places you. <u>Third</u>, in verses six through 11, Solomon provides examples regarding how believers should follow Yahweh’s standards of righteousness found in His Word. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you should also follow His standards of righteousness found in His Word. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 12 through 16, Solomon provides examples regarding how believers should be awake and alert. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you should also be spiritually alert to deception. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 17 through 20, Solomon provides examples for how believers should follow the truth over the lies that the enemy uses to attack Yahweh’s order. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you should also follow the truth He lays out in His Word. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 21 through 24, Solomon provides examples of conduct to show how believers should trust in Yahweh’s provision and justice. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, He also wants you to trust in His provision and His justice. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 25 through 30, Solomon provides examples for how believers should obey Yahweh. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, your faith should also include the fruit of obedience to Him.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Abstain from getting drunk off alcohol or high off drugs</u>. Solomon began by urging believers to abstain from becoming intoxicated. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Wine is a mocker, intoxicating drink a brawler, and whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise</em>.” (Prov. 20:1). “First comes temperance, enforced by the picture of a drunkard. Wine and strong drink are, as it were, personified, and their effects on men are painted as their own characters. And an ugly picture it is, which should hang in the gallery of every young man and woman. ‘Wine is a mocker.’ Intemperance delights in scoffing at all pure, lofty, sacred things. It is the ally of wild profanity, which sends up its tipsy and clumsy ridicule against Heaven itself. If a man wants to lose his sense of reverence, his susceptibility for what is noble, let him take to drink, and the thing is done.” (Alexander MacLaren on Prov. 20:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Alcohol can lead to sin</u>.  God does not want His people to become drunk or stoned.  “Do not get drunk with wine.” (Eph. 5:18; Prov. 20:1; Isa 5:11; 56:12; Jer. 23:9; Joel 3:3). Alcohol can cause people to lose their inhibitions.  Your self-control can become less rigid, and you may be more inclined to say or do things that you should not do.  “For they will drink and forget what is decreed.”  (Prov. 31:5).  “He who loves wine and oil will not become rich.”  (Prov. 21:17).  Wine or drunkenness is also symbolic of God’s wrath (Rev. 14:8, 10; 16:19; 17:2; 18:3).  Small use of alcohol can lead to greater use.  It can also be a form of idolatry if you use it to escape your struggles.  Jesus did not prohibit believers from drinking wine.  One of his first miracles was to create multiple gallons of wine  (Jo. 2:6-11).  He also drank wine at the Last Supper  (Matt. 26:28) Jesus, however, advises that His disciples must deny themselves  (Lk. 9:23).  Alcohol can also sometimes cause others to stumble.  Paul also warns: “It is good not to eat <em>or to drink wine</em>, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.”  (Rom. 14:21).  Elders and deacons further should not serve if they were “addicted to wine or strong drink”  (1 Tim 3:3, 8; Tit. 1:7).  They could cause others to stumble.  Likewise, older persons must not be addicted to wine because they may be a role model to others  (Tit. 2:3).  Your serving alcohol can, in some circumstances, cause a weak believer to stumble. Alcohol can also sometimes create the appearance of evil.  The devil tempted the Nazarites, like Sampson, to drink wine  (Amos 2:12).  The devil can also use wine to tempt others to sin.  Even when not prohibited, we are to “Abstain from all appearance of evil.”<em> </em> (1 Thess. 5:22).</p></li>

<p>Honor Jesus by restraining any desire you might have to get drunk or high<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Abstain from rebellion against authority</u>. Restraining your flesh also includes controlling your desires to rebel against authority. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion; one who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life</em>.” (Prov. 20:2). “The wrath and displeasure of a king, which causes fear; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm"><u>Proverbs 19:12</u></a>; kings should be terrors to evil works and workers, though not to good ones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm"><u>Romans 13:3</u></a>. This is true of the King of kings, who one day will be terrible to the drunkards, the mockers, and murderers of his people, before spoken of; whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul; he exposes his life to danger:” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 20:2).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Unless you are asked to sin, Jesus wants you to submit to His appointed authority</u>. In other proverbs, Solomon warned of the dangers in provoking a king’s wrath. “The fury of a king is like messengers of death; but a wise person will appease it.” (Prov. 16:14). “A king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.” (Prov. 19:12). Unless believers are asked to engage in evil, believers are required to submit to Jesus’ appointed authority. “Every person is to be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a servant of God to you for good. but if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a servant of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.” (Rom. 13:1-4). “Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.” (1 Pet. 2:13-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Abstain from creating strife and conflict</u>. Unless you are rebuking sin, restraining your flesh should also include controlling your instincts to create strife and conflict. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Avoiding strife is an honor for a person, but any fool will quarrel</em>.” (Prov. 20:3). “Men think it is their wisdom to engage in quarrels; whereas it is the greatest folly that can be … Men think, when they are engaged in quarrels, that it would be a shame to them to go back and let fall the weapon; whereas really <em>it is an honour for a man to cease from strife,</em> an honour to withdraw an action, to drop a controversy, to forgive an injury, and to be friends with those that we have fallen out with.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 20:3).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Control your anger when you are attacked</u>. Whenever possible, believers are called upon to avoid conflict. “One who is slow to anger has great understanding; but one who is quick-tempered exalts foolishness.” (Prov. 14:29). “One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and one who rules his spirit, than one who captures a city.” (Prov. 16:32). “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, for anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9). “The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged,” (2 Tim. 2:24). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20).</p></li>

<h2 id="diligence-holy-conduct-includes-serving-diligently-wherever-jesus-has-placed-you.-prov.-204-5."><strong>2. <u>Diligence: Holy Conduct Includes Serving Diligently Wherever Jesus Has Placed You</u>. Prov. 20:4-5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be diligent wherever Jesus has placed you</u>. Solomon next warned believers against the sin of slothfulness in work. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The lazy one does not plow after the autumn, so he begs during the harvest and has nothing</em>.” (Prov. 20:4). “The <strong>lazy man</strong> always finds some excuse not to do his work. It is always too early or too late in the season to begin. It is always <strong>winter</strong>, and the ground is too hard for plowing. Any excuse will work when the heart is set on not working … <strong>He will beg during harvest and have nothing</strong>: The <strong>lazy man </strong><em>will</em> work, after a fashion – he will do the work of begging. Having no reward from the work of his hands, he will even have to <strong>beg during harvest</strong>. Often his begging will go unrewarded (<strong>have nothing</strong>).” (David Guzik on Prov. 20:4) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Be a diligent worker wherever Jesus has placed you<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Work diligently for Jesus</u>. Solomon frequently warned against the sin of slothfulness. “Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.” (Prov. 10:4-5). “The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor.” (Prov. 12:24). “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). “Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger.” (Prov. 19:15). “The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work;” (Prov. 21:25). “Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks.” (Ecc. 10:18). Jesus has given every person gifts. He also warns every person about the sin of failing to use His gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be diligent in seeking to discern God’s plans for you</u>. In order to be wise in where you invest your labors, Jesus wants you to diligently seek out His wisdom. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A plan in the heart of a person is like deep water, but a person of understanding draws it out</em>.” (Prov. 20:5). “Human motives are not always clear, even to the person themselves. A wise person can draw them out of himself through thought and prayer. Or he can help another uncover them by counseling him. Even outside of counseling, motives, intentions, thoughts, and expectations can sometimes be discerned by a wise person. God has placed in the church gifted individuals who can assist others by leading them into a correct understanding of those inner aspects of motivation. Everything that lies in a person's heart needs to conform to God's standards and plans. God does not leave us alone in this. In addition to wise counselors in the church, the Holy Spirit searches the heart and convicts believers of sin—whatever is contrary to God's standards and plans. He helps believers know the truth (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-26.html"><u>John 14:26</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/15/John-15-26.html"><u>15:26</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/John/16/John-16-13.html"><u>16:13–15</u></a>).” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 20:5).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Diligently read the Word, pray, and seek out wise counsel to discern Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Jesus’ wisdom is easily accessible. But it requires the diligent study of His Word, prayer, and godly counsel to draw it out. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8). “For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “For who among people knows the thoughts of a person except the spirit of the person that is in him? So also the thoughts of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.” (1 Cor. 2:11).</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-righteousness-honor-jesus-with-holy-conduct-by-turning-to-him-and-following-his-righteousness.-prov.-206-11."><strong>3. <u>Jesus’ Righteousness: Honor Jesus with Holy Conduct By Turning to Him and Following His Righteousness</u>. Prov. 20:6-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Your righteousness comes from Jesus</u>. Solomon warned against those who professed to be righteous. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Many a person proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a trustworthy person</em>?” (Prov. 20:6). “The verse from Proverbs 20:6 holds a powerful truth about the nature of humanity. It speaks of the tendency for people to boast about their own goodness. It reminds us that while many declare themselves to be loyal or good-hearted, true loyalty and goodness are rare qualities to find in today’s world. This insight invites us to consider the attributes we value in others and encourages us to be introspective about our own character … showing genuine faithfulness is far more impressive than merely saying, ‘I am a good person.’ It tells us that being a faithful person takes action, commitment, and more than just words.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 20:6).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Without Jesus, your righteousness is like a filthy rag to Him</u>. May proclaim to be loyal, faithful, or righteous without realizing their sins. “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). David also lamented those who spoke with deceit about themselves or used false flattery to profess their faith (Ps. 12:1-2; 78:36-37). Jesus also condemned those who offer false flattering words of faith in Him. “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me.” (Matt. 15:8). With Jesus, a person’s good works are like filthy rages (Is. 64:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those with godly integrity</u>. For the person who faithfully lives with godly integrity, Solomon promised that Yahweh will bless the person’s entire family. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>A righteous person who walks in his integrity— how blessed are his sons after him.”</em> (Prov. 20:7). “The man of pure life, who religiously performs his duty towards God and man, shall bring a blessing on his children who follow his good example, both during his life and after his death … Some see here an instance of utilitarianism; but it cannot be supposed that the writer inculcates virtue for the sake of the worldly advantages connected with it; rather he speaks from experience, and from a faithful dependence on Providence, of the happy results of a holy life.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 20:7).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-20/media/image4.jpg" style="width:5.99954in;height:2.17355in" alt="Proverbs 20:7 KJV - Verse of the day" /></p>
<p>Jesus is faithful to bless both you and your family when you walk with integrity<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus promises to bless any family that lives with godly integrity</u>. Jesus promised to bless any family that keeps His statutes, His Commandments and His Word. “So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, so that it may go well for you and for your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time.” (Dt. 4:40; Ps. 103:17-18; 112:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pursue godly justice for the oppressed in society</u>. Wherever Jesus has placed you, He wants you to use you to pursue justice for those in need. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>A king who sits on the throne of justice disperses all evil with his eyes</em>.” (Prov. 20:8). “The phrase ‘A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment’ signifies not just a position of power but a responsibility to make righteous judgments. It conveys the image of a leader actively engaged in the process of discerning right from wrong and making decisions that align with justice. Similarly, the imagery of ‘scattereth away all evil with his eyes’ portrays a leader who possesses the insight to identify and eradicate evil and injustice, symbolizing a vigilant guardian of righteousness. In conclusion, <a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/proverbs/proverbs_20_8/">Proverbs 20:8</a> serves as a poignant reminder for leaders and individuals alike to embody wisdom, discernment, and justice in their actions. By adhering to these principles, we can contribute to the cultivation of a more just and equitable society, where righteousness prevails, and fairness guides our interactions. Let us heed the call of <a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/proverbs/proverbs_20_8/">Proverbs 20:8</a> and strive to be beacons of wisdom and justice in our spheres of influence, fostering a world where righteousness flourishes and injustice finds no haven.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 20:8).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the source of true justice and will reign with justice and righteousness</u>. Solomon credited Yahweh as the true source for a leader’s justice and righteousness. “By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly.” (Prov. 8:15-16). Thus, Solomon asked God to guide him in his rule as King of Israel. “So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil. For who is capable of judging this great people of Yours?”’ (1 Kgs. 3:9). “A Psalm of Solomon. Give the king Your judgments, God, and Your righteousness to the king’s son. May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.” (Ps. 72:1-2). Jesus will rule as the King of Kings with perfect justice, wisdom, peace, and righteousness (Is. 11:2-4; Lk. 4:18; Rev. 17:14; 19:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>True righteousness is impossible without Jesus</u>. Solomon warned believers against deluding themselves into believing that they can be righteous based upon their good acts. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Who can say, ‘I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin’</em>?” (Prov. 20:9). “Though we may have done our best by self-examination and confession, and repentance and trust in the atoning blood of Christ to obtain remission of sin, still the heart is so deceitful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>), sins may so easily have escaped our notice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), that satisfaction with ourselves ought never to be allowed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>).” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 20:9).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Every person is unrighteous without faith in Jesus</u>. The Bible repeatedly declares that every person is a sinner before God. “Indeed, there is not a righteous person on earth who always does good and does not ever sin.” (Ecc. 7:20; Prov. 20:9; 1 Kgs. 8:46; 2 Chr. 6:36). “[F]or all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Ro. 3:23). It is only through faith in Jesus’ atoning sacrifice at the cross that a believer is made “righteous.” (E.g., Ro. 3:22; Gal. 2:16). Thus, no one can be “righteous” before God through their “good” works or their efforts to be pure. Instead, sin has to first be atoned for through the shedding of blood before any person can seek to draw closer to God (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). Jesus’ blood atonement on the cross was a one-time sacrifice (Heb. 10:14; Matt. 26:28; Eph. 1:7). Salvation is available to anyone who believes in Him (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ righteousness includes integrity in business</u>. Solomon next warned that a person cannot claim to be righteous before God while cheating others through deceptive business practices. “<strong><sup>10</sup></strong> <em>Differing weights and differing measures, both of them are abominable to the Lord</em>.” (Prov. 20:10). “God hates corrupt business practices, so be careful in all your financial and business dealings. It would be better to overpay for something than to underpay, because God can make up the difference in money, but no one can save you from the Judge of all the earth … You will have opportunities today to be fair, generous, honest, righteous, and sacrificial. If you choose to protect yourself and cheat anyone else, even by a very small amount, your Creator God will be offended and make sure you lose in life. If you choose to be considerate, diligent, faithful, and trustworthy, you can beautify the gospel of Jesus Christ. The honest man shows himself to be a true child of God (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps%2015.1-5;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Ps 15:1-5</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Rom%2012.17;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Rom 12:17</u></a>).” (LetGodbeTrue.com on Prov. 20:10).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A transformed believer acts with integrity in all his or her dealings with others</u>.  In Old Testament times, the primary means of calculating a fair price in commerce was with a scale.  Thus, God’s people were warned against manipulating their scales to increase their profits:  “‘You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or capacity. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt.’”  (Lev. 19:35-36; Dt. 25:13-15; Ez. 45:10). “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> A false balance is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but a just weight is His delight.” (Prov. 11:1). “Differing weights are an abomination to the LORD, and a false scale is not good.” (Prov. 20:23). “Can I justify dishonest balances, and a bag of fraudulent weights?” (Hosea 12:7).  Persons who defraud others will also face God’s judgment  (Micah 6:11).  This warning also applies to Christians. “Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,” (1 Pet. 2:1). Jesus was blameless in all His dealings. Believers should imitate His example.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your righteousness be observed in your fruits</u>. Adults can be deceitful. But a young child’s character is known through conduct. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>It is by his deeds that a boy distinguishes himself, if his conduct is pure and right</em>.” (Prov. 20:11). “<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-11.html">Proverbs 20:11</a> is an indictment against <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-hypocrisy.html">hypocrisy</a> and deceit, attitudes that displease God and are condemned in Scripture (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/26/Psalm-26-4.html">Psalm 26:4</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/29/Isaiah-29-13.html">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/23/Matthew-23-27.html">Matthew 23:27–28</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/12/Luke-12-1.html">Luke 12:1–2</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/20/Luke-20-46.html">20:46–47</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Titus/1/Titus-1-16.html">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/2/1-Peter-2-1.html">1 Peter 2:1</a>). A hypocrite pretends to be something or someone on the outside to hide his inner reality. But God knows who we are and what we are truly like on the inside (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/16/Luke-16-15.html">Luke 16:15</a>). He sees through false displays of purity and righteousness to uncover what lies in our hearts. Not only does God see below the surface to unmask duplicity, but eventually people will see through it, too. Thus, Solomon warns the wise person to consider the danger of deception and duplicity (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-12.html">Proverbs 6:12–15</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-10.html">10:10</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/11/Proverbs-11-3.html">11:3</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/16/Proverbs-16-30.html">16:30</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/20/Proverbs-20-14.html">20:14</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/23/Proverbs-23-6.html">23:6–8</a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/23/Proverbs-23-23.html">23–26</a>). These verses double as a caution to the wise to look out for insincerity in others who may not have our best interests in mind. <em>Even a child is known by his deeds</em> also suggests that our behavior is the most decisive proof test of uprightness and virtue. A child may say, “I’m a well-behaved kid.” But if he disobeys his parents and teachers, starts fights, breaks the law, and constantly seeks out trouble, his actions reveal the true story. As children are known by their conduct, so we should all be distinguished by purity, genuineness, sincerity, and <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-honesty.html"><u>truthfulness</u></a> in our commitment to God and in our service toward others.” (Gotquestions.org on Prov. 20:11).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be authentic and transparent before Jesus</u>. Jesus knows what is within your heart. “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10). Even when people offer polished words, you will ultimately know their true character by their actions. “You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.” (Matt. 7:16-18; Lk. 6:43-44). Believers should therefore live without deceitful conduct. “Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,” (1 Pet. 2:1).</p></li>

Prov. 20:12-16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>You can be pulled off your walk if you become spiritually blind to the enemy’s deceit</u>. God gave people eyes and ears to be alert to false schemes and to test everything to avoid being deceived. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made both of them</em>.” (Prov. 20:12). “To enable his people to live wisely, <em>I AM</em> created two organs: ears and eyes. In Proverbs, <em>a hearing ear</em> is almost always associated with hearing and obeying the instruction of the wise. The conjunction of it with <em>a seeing eye</em> could signify that the latter means to read and obey their instruction (cf. ‘have I not written for you,’ 22:20). More probably, however, by the catchword ‘eye’ it should be connected with ‘open your eye’ in v. 13 and so signifies being alert. <em>Indeed, both of them,</em> I AM <em>has made</em> since learning the proverbs by ear and keeping the eye alert to apply them are necessary to live abundantly.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 20:12).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be alert to receive wisdom</u>. Jesus does not want you to be blind to His Word. “Now hear this, you foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear.” (Jer. 5:21). Jesus spoke in parables because people are spiritually blind and unable to clearly distinguish His wisdom from the enemy’s lies (Matt. 13:13-16)</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be alert at all times to consume Jesus’ Word</u>. Jesus wants you to be alert at all times so that you may respond to Him and serve Him and avoid being complacent when evil is present. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>Do not love sleep, or you will become poor; open your eyes, and you will be satisfied with food</em>.” (Prov. 20:13). “Persons that indulge themselves in sleep to excess, not only lose the time which they spend therein, but contract a listless, indolent disposition and habit, and are generally half asleep, or never well awake, and therefore, of course, come to poverty. <em>Open thine eyes — </em>Awake out of sleep, shake off sloth, and betake thyself to thy employment with diligence and vigor. <em>Thou shalt be satisfied with bread — </em>If thou do not grow rich, yet thou shalt have what is sufficient for the supply of thy own wants, and the wants of those dependent upon thee.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary of the Old and New Testaments, Prov. 20:13).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be alert to serve wherever Jesus has placed you</u>. Solomon gave other warnings where he equated excessive sleep with slothfulness. “How long will you lie down, you lazy one? When will you arise from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, then your poverty will come in like a drifter, and your need like an armed man.” (Prov. 6:9-11; 24:33-34). In the New Testament, excessive sleep typically arises in a spiritual context. People are warned to be awake and alert because the hour of salvation is near. A person can die at any moment without a chance to prepare. “Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we first believed. The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let’s rid ourselves of the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” (Ro. 13:11-12). “so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.” (1 Thess. 5:6-8).</p></li>

<p>Be spiritually alert and ready to receive Jesus’ direction and to avoid deception<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be alert to the deception and lies</u>. Jesus also wants you to be alert for unscrupulous people who engage in deceit business dealings. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>‘<em>Bad, bad,’ says the buyer, but when he goes his way, then he boasts</em>.” (Prov. 20:14). “This describes another trick of the dishonest trader. He belittles and downgrades what is offered for sale; and then, when he is able to purchase it for less than it is worth, he brags about his cleverness. Even as a child, this writer learned the ways of dishonest traders that falsely graded the cotton they bought.” (James Burton Coffman’s Commentaries on the Bible, Prov. 20:14).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be alert to restrain your desires to obtain wealth by unholy means</u>. Jesus condemns those who engage in deceit to enrich themselves, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than a person who is perverse in speech and is a fool.” (Prov. 19:1). “Ill-gotten gains do not benefit, but righteousness rescues from death.” (Prov. 10:2). “The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor, the pursuit of death.” (Prov. 21:6). “Buy truth, and do not sell it, get wisdom, instruction, and understanding.” (Prov. 23:23). Thus, you must avoid falling into temptation from the love of money. “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.” (1 Tim. 6:9-10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Stay spiritually alert by prioritizing Jesus’ Word over worldly wealth</u>. To maintain a holy walk that honors Jesus, He wants you to prioritize seeking the wisdom of His Word over the pursuit of worldly riches. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>There is gold, and an abundance of jewels; but lips of knowledge are a more precious thing</em>.” (Prov. 20:15). “Proverbs 20:15 teaches us about the incredible value of knowledge and insight compared to material wealth. In a world where shiny things often grab our attention, this verse reminds us that true worth comes not from what can be bought or sold, but from the wisdom and understanding we share with others. Gold and rubies are symbols of wealth, and while they have their place, they pale in comparison to the value of knowledge. When we consider the importance of knowledge, we recognize that it is a tool that empowers us to make wise decisions, nurture relationships, and even solve problems. It goes beyond the ability to recite facts; it encompasses understanding, experience, and the ability to apply what we have learned in real-life situations. Knowledge allows us to connect with others and contribute positively to our communities.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 20:15).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom should be your greatest treasure</u>. Solomon declared that God’s people should consider Yahweh’s wisdom as being greater than any treasure. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her produce better than gold. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her<em>.</em>” (Prov. 3:3-15; 2:4-5; 8:10-11; 16:16). Job revealed that God’s wisdom is greater than any worldly treasure (Job 28:15-19). Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). “[I]n whom are hidden all the <em>treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes His wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be alert to circumstances that place you into bondage</u>. Solomon next warned against help that places you in bondage. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>Take his garment when he becomes guarantor for a stranger; and for foreigners, seize a pledge from him</em>.” (Prov. 20:16). “This verse emphasizes the risk a creditor takes in granting a loan. The debtor or cosigner may never repay the debt. The creditor—the one lending money or property—is advised to hold something from the borrower to help guarantee the debt will be repaid. The garment, in this case, serves as a pledge … Other proverbs warn about taking on debt, especially on behalf of others (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/6/Proverbs-6-1.html"><u>Proverbs 6:1</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/11/Proverbs-11-15.html"><u>11:15</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/22/Proverbs-22-6.html"><u>22:6</u></a>). This statement seems to emphasize caution about the character of those who seek to borrow. The phrasing refers to lending ‘for a stranger’ and ‘for foreigners.’ ‘Foreigners’ is translated from the Hebrew <em>nākri</em>. This is the same term used in <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/7/Proverbs-7-5.html"><u>Proverbs 7:5</u></a> in reference to an immoral woman. In the Old Testament context, ‘foreigners’ were not merely people of other cultures, they were worshippers of idols (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/7/Deuteronomy-7-1.html"><u>Deuteronomy 7:1–5</u></a>). Lending is risky enough—lending to immoral or ungodly people is even more dangerous.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 20:16).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Being alert does not relieve you of your need to show compassion</u>. Under God’s law, a creditor had to show compassion towards a borrower in need. “If you ever seize your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets, for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body. What else is he to sleep in? And it will come about that when he cries out to Me, I will listen to him, for I am gracious.” (Ex. 22:26-27; Dt. 24:10-13). God will repay what the person in need cannot repay. “One who is gracious to a poor person lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” (Prov. 19:17; Matt. 5:42; Matt. 25:40; Heb. 6:10; Jam. 2:15-16). Thus, do not use the excuse of avoiding economic bondage as a reason to deny help for those in need.</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-truth-holy-conduct-includes-following-jesus-truth.-prov.-2017-20."><strong>5. <u>Jesus’ Truth: Holy Conduct Includes Following Jesus’ Truth</u>. Prov. 20:17-20.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Holy conduct that honors Jesus requires truth</u>. Solomon next warned that those who use lies and deception to gain money will one day face God’s judgment. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>Bread obtained by a lie is sweet to a person, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel</em>.” (Prov. 20:17). “A person may think he is getting by with deceit, and it may seem sweet to him. No one gets by with a thing – God will see to that.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 20:17).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The pleasure of wealth obtained through dishonest gain passes quickly</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned that those who obtained wealth through dishonest means will one day face God’s judgment. “Stolen water is sweet; and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.” (Prov. 9:17-18). “He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live.” (Prov. 15:27). “The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor, the pursuit of death.” (Prov. 21:6). “A faithful person will abound with blessings, but one who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished.” (Prov. 28:20). Most people do not start off engaging in dishonest business practices. Instead, the love of money pulls them down this dark path. “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” (1 Tim. 6:9-10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Knowing Jesus’ truth can be a matter of life or death</u>. On any issue of importance, you must constantly seek out Jesus’ wisdom. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>Prepare plans by consultation, and make war by wise guidance</em>.” (Prov. 20:18). “a. <strong>Plans are established by counsel</strong>: There is help and wisdom in realizing our own limitations and seeking <strong>counsel</strong>. This often leads to our <strong>plans</strong> being <strong>established</strong> in the sense of coming to fulfillment. b. <strong>By wise counsel wage war</strong>: This shows that <strong>wise counsel</strong> is even more important when great matters are involved – life and death matters, such as <strong>war</strong>. By spiritual analogy, we wage the spiritual warfare we must fight as believers with the <strong>wise counsel</strong> of God’s word and other believers (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Ephesians+6.10-18&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Ephesians 6:10-18</u></a>).” (David Guzik on Prov. 20:18).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Whenever you lead others, seek Jesus’ truth through the Word, prayer, and godly counsel</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned that a nation will fail if its leader is not guided by wise counsel in matters involving life or death. “Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is victory.” (Prov. 11:14). “Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with many counselors they succeed.” (Prov. 15:22; 24:6). Following Solomon’s death, the people threatened a revolt. Solomon’s elders advised his son, the new King Rehoboam, to offer kind words to the disgruntled people. But Rehoboam rejected their advice and instead sought out young inexperienced advisors who would agree with him (1 Kgs. 12:6-8). His actions lead to a civil war and the division of the nation of Israel. Jesus also advised that believers must also count the costs and seek His wisdom before undertaking important matters for Him (Lk. 14:31-32).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous surround themselves with godly counsel</u>. Solomon later repeated his encouragement to seek godly counsel. “Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with many counselors they succeed.” (Prov. 15:22). In order to serve Jesus and help others, He warns believers that they need to carefully prepare (Lk. 14:28-31). This begins with prayer. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). But believers should also seek godly counsel. Even Moses was willing to receive the wise counsel of Jethro about the need for him to delegate responsibilities (Ex. 18:13-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To walk with holy conduct that honors Jesus, avoid all forms of gossip</u>. To walk in Jesus’ truth, you must avoid gossip and those who gossip. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a gossip</em>.” (Prov. 20:19). “Gossiping can be seen as breaking trust with others and with God … When we engage in gossip, we are not only betraying the trust of the person being talked about but also breaking the trust of those who confide in us. It shows a lack of respect for the privacy and dignity of others, and can lead to a breakdown in relationships based on honesty and mutual respect. Gossiping goes against the principles of love, kindness, and compassion that are central to many faith traditions in the eyes of God. We can build trust with others and honor our relationship with God by refraining from gossiping and choosing to speak with integrity and kindness. It is important to remember that our words have the power to either uplift or tear down, and by choosing to speak with respect and honesty, we can nurture trust in our relationships and demonstrate our commitment to living in accordance with God’s teachings.” (Reverend Michael Johnson, GodsBless.ing on Prov. 20:19).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The momentary pleasures of gossip quickly fade</u>. Gossip brings momentary pleasure but ultimately causes great harm to relationships. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the body.” (Prov. 18:8; 26:22). Gossip also divides friends. “A perverse person spreads strife, and a slanderer separates close friends.” (Prov. 16:28). Even worse, gossip frequently involves slander. “One who goes about as a slanderer reveals secrets, but one who is trustworthy conceals a matter.” (Prov. 11:13). Thus, believers are warned to not associate with gossipers (Prov. 20:19). In the Old Testament, God promises to judge those who “secretly slander,” another phrase for gossip (Ps. 101:5; 1 Tim. 5:13; Ro. 16:17-18; 2 Thess. 3:11).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>To walk with holy conduct that honors Jesus, avoid lies that undermine your family</u>. Because the family was Yahweh’s designated institution for teaching His truth to the next generation of believers, Solomon condemned those who curse the family Yahweh gave them. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>He who curses his father or his mother, his lamp will go out in time of darkness.”</em> (Prov. 20:20). “An unruly child becomes very wicked by degrees, until he will finally hate his own parents and curses them. To that child, the judgment of God is pronounced (<em>Matt. 15:4</em>); utter darkness awaits him.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 20:20).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who dishonor or hurt their parents face discipline or punishment</u>. The Fourth Commandment requires children to honor their parents (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Thus, unrepentant sinners who dishonor, or assault their parents face severe discipline or judgment. “The eye that mocks a father and scorns a mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it.” (Prov. 30:17). “And one who curses his father or his mother shall certainly be put to death.” (Ex. 21:17; Lev. 20:9; Dt. 21:18-21).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trust-honor-jesus-with-holy-conduct-by-trusting-him.-prov.-2021-24."><strong>6. <u>Trust: Honor Jesus with Holy Conduct by Trusting Him</u>. Prov. 20:21-24.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Honor Jesus by trusting in His provision</u>. Solomon next warned about the dangers that come from inheriting wealth too quickly. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>An inheritance gained in a hurry at the beginning will not be blessed in the end</em>.” (Prov. 20:21). “Proverbs 20:21 talks about the importance of patience when it comes to wealth and resources … Many times, we may think that having instant wealth brings happiness. However, this verse reminds us that if we receive wealth too quickly, we may squander it all without appreciating its value or learning how to manage it. This isn’t just about money; it speaks to the wisdom we gain from hard work and patience. Those who build their wealth slowly often learn valuable life lessons along the way. They understand the importance of budgeting, saving, and planning for the future. Therefore, Proverbs 20:21 encourages us to be wise stewards of whatever resources we are given, rather than rushing into circumstances that could lead to negative consequences.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 20:21).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Prodigal son squandered his inheritance because he did not appreciate its value</u>. In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, the son squandered his quickly obtained inheritance because he had not worked for it, and he did not appreciate the value of what he received. “And He said, ‘A man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that is coming to me.’ And <em>so</em> he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his estate in wild living. Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began doing without.” (Lk. 15:11-14). Instead of longing for an inheritance of money, believers should long for an inheritance of Jesus’ wisdom. “Wisdom along with an inheritance is good, and an advantage to those who see the sun.” (Ecc. 7:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Honor Jesus by trusting in His justice</u>. Those who seek vengeance when wronged are quick to fall from Jesus’ path of holiness. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Do not say, ‘I will repay evil’; wait for the Lord, and He will save you</em>.” (Prov. 20:22). “Do not look for vengeance on enemies (for they are to be forgiven), but for deliverance from their attacks; forget their malice, remember only God’s love for thee, and trust in Him. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm"><u>1Peter 3:13</u></a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm"><u>Romans 8:28</u></a>.)” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers, Prov. 20:22).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-20/media/image3.jpg" style="width:6.02083in;height:2.43964in" alt="Forgive" /></p>
<p>Choose the path of forgiveness and leave vengeance to God<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Leave vengeance to God</u>. Solomon also proclaimed: “Be assured, the evil person will not go unpunished, but the descendants of the righteous will be rescued.” (Prov. 11:21). “For there will be no future for the evil person; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.” (Prov. 24:20). “The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked goes out.” (Prov. 13:9). But God will do so in His timing to give sinners every chance to repent and turn back to Him. Thus, David also warned believers not to be vengeful: “Cease from anger and abandon wrath; do not get upset; it leads only to evildoing.” (Ps. 37:8). “Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written: ‘vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.” (Ro. 12:19; Dt. 32:35). “All bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander must be removed from you, along with all malice.” (Eph. 4:31). Jesus is just and fair. But the time of final judgment of sin is up to Him. Thus, when you are wronged, forgive others and trust in Jesus’ justice.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trusting in Jesus’ provision includes avoiding unethical shortcuts to wealth</u>. Believers are meant to reflect Jesus’ light (Matt. 5:14-16). Thus, you fail to honor Him or show trust in Him when you cheat others. “<strong><sup>23</sup></strong> <em>Differing weights are an abomination to the Lord, and a false scale is not good</em>.” (Prov. 20:23). “This verse from <a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/proverbs/proverbs_23_23/"><u>Proverbs 23:23</u></a> emphasizes the importance of valuing truth, wisdom, discipline, and understanding above all else. It advises us to invest in these qualities as if they were precious treasures that should never be compromised or traded away. It is a reminder to prioritize seeking knowledge and understanding in all aspects of our lives, even if it means making sacrifices or facing challenges…Proverbs 23:23 is a call to value wisdom, instruction, and understanding above all else.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 20:23).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who obtain wealth by unethical means face Jesus’ discipline or punishment</u>. Jesus condemned those who defrauded others by manipulating their scales. people were warned against manipulating their scales to increase their profits (Lev. 19:35-36; Dt. 25:13-15; Ez. 45:10; Hosea 12:7; Micah 6:11; Prov. 11:1; 20:10). When you lie and defraud others, you place yourself under Satan’s influence. He is the father of lies (Jo. 8:44). Believers turn to Jesus and walk in His truth. “Teach me Your way, LORD; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.” (Ps. 86:11). If you seek after Jesus’ righteousness, you don’t need to cheat or deceive. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust that Jesus is sovereign</u>. It is easier to trust in Jesus’ provision and justice when you trust that He is in control. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>A man’s steps are ordained by the Lord; how then can a person understand his way</em>?” (Prov. 20:24). “We are here taught that in all our affairs, 1. We have a necessary and constant dependence upon God. All our natural actions depend upon his providence, all our spiritual actions upon his grace. The best man is no better than God makes him; and every creature is that to us which it is the will of God that it should be. Our enterprises succeed, not as we desire and design, but as God directs and disposes … 2. We have no foresight of future events, and therefore know not how to forecast for them: <em>How can a man understand his own way?</em> How can he tell what will befall him, since God's counsels concerning him are secret, and therefore how can he of himself contrive what to do without divine direction? We so little understand our own way that we know not what is good for ourselves, and therefore we must make a virtue of necessity, and commit our way unto the Lord, in whose hand it is, follow the guidance and submit to the disposal of Providence.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 20:24).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust that Jesus is in control</u>. All authority has been given to Jesus. “And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.”’ (Matt. 28:18). Thus, Jesus is sovereign. “The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He pleases.” (Prov. 21:1). “The steps of a man are established by the LORD, and He delights in his way.” (Ps. 37:23). “The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all.” (Ps. 103:19). “I know, LORD, that a person’s way is not in himself, nor is it in a person who walks to direct his steps.” (Jer. 10:23). Everything He does is for a greater good for those who love Him. “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="obedience-holy-conduct-includes-the-fruit-of-obedience.-prov.-2025-30."><strong>7. <u>Obedience: Holy Conduct Includes the Fruit of Obedience</u>. Prov. 20:25-30.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>To honor Jesus with your conduct, be obedient to your vows</u>. Solomon next warned believers against making carless vows to Yahweh that cannot be fulfilled. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>It is a trap for a person to say carelessly, ‘It is holy!’ And after the vows to make inquiry</em>.” (Prov. 20:25). “It is a snare to a man to utter a vow (of consecration) rashly, and after vows to inquire whether he can fulfill them.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 20:25).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient to your promises to Jesus</u>. God’s law requires persons to keep their vows. “If a man makes a vow to the LORD, or takes an oath to put himself under a binding obligation, he shall not break his word; he shall act in accordance with everything that comes out of his mouth.” (Nu. 30:2; Dt. 23:21-23; Ecc. 5:4-5). Jephthah, one of Israel’s deliverers, made a foolish vow that led to him sacrificing his daughter (Jdg. 11:34-35) This law also did not disappear in the New Testament. Jesus and the disciples repeated it (Matt. 5:33-37; Jam. 5:12). Thus, you should be careful before making vows to Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient when implementing Jesus’ standards of justice as a leader</u>. If Jesus has placed you in a place of authority, you must also obediently follow His Word when disciplining or judging a person caught in sin. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>A wise king scatters the wicked, and drives a threshing wheel over them</em>.” (Prov. 20:26). “Solomon (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-1.html">Proverbs 10:1</a>), the wise king and judge (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/3/1-Kings-3-10.html">1 Kings 3:10–12</a>), comments on the importance of justice in leadership. Biblical wisdom starts with proper respect for God and His will (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-7.html">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-1.html">3:1–6</a>). One of the reasons God institutes human government is to restrain evil (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/13/Romans-13-1.html">Romans 13:1–5</a>), which involves separating the guilty from the innocent. Then, those who are guilty should be punished, to deter others from committing the same crimes. The figurative speech here uses imagery from agriculture. … Threshing was also associated with judgment, but more often tied to punishment (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/6/Judges-6-11.html">Judges 6:11</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/8/Judges-8-7.html">8:7</a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Judges/8/Judges-8-16.html">16</a>). It is important for government to separate the innocent from the guilty, but equally important that it properly punish lawbreakers. Jesus will one day return to earth and establish His kingdom. As a wise king, He will rule with justice and righteousness.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 20:26).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8).  “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30).  “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1; 9:7; 16:5; 24:15; 42:4). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Zech. 9:9-10).  He will separate the sheep from the goats, the righteous from the unrighteous, and judge those who reject His mercy and grace (Matt. 25:31-46).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient to the direction of the Holy Spirit</u>. To honor Jesus with your conduct, you need to let the Holy Spirit search your heart, convict you of sin, and guide your path. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>The spirit of a person is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the innermost parts of his being</em>.” (Prov. 20:27). “The spirit of man is the candle (or lamp) of the LORD [Jehovah].” Notice it is called the candle or lamp of Jehovah, not the <em>light</em> of Jehovah. The spirit of man is only the lamp, the vessel that holds the light. Man is just a lamp, and until we are filled by the Holy Spirit, we don’t become a light. Remember the parable of the ten virgins. Five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They were just lamps. Without the oil, they could not have light.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 20:27).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient to Jesus’ guiding light</u>. Jesus’ light guides you when you are trapped in darkness. “For You light my lamp; the LORD my God illumines my darkness.” (Ps. 18:28). “In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.” (Jo. 1:4-5). “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). The Triune God knows all things and searches your heart (Jer. 17:10; Prov. 21:2). God wants you to invite this searching to point out your sins so that you can repent when you fall into sin. “Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test and know my anxious thoughts; and see if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.” (Ps. 139:23-24; 26:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey Jesus’ will to make wise decisions</u>. When a leader is obedient to Jesus, He will guide all decisions in truth. “<strong><sup>28</sup></strong> <em>Loyalty and truth watch over the king, and he upholds his throne by loyalty</em>.” (Prov. 20:28). “This proverb matches the king’s judgment on the wicked (v. 26) with his <em>kindness and reliability</em> … to his otherwise helpless subject who appeals to him for justice (see v. 22). <em>Guard</em> personifies these two virtues as protecting <em>the king</em>. The king <em>upholds his throne</em>, the symbol of his authority and dominion, <em>with kindness</em> (‘and reliability’ is gapped). <em>I AM</em> supports and safeguards his king (cf. 2 Sam. 7:15; Pss. 2:6ff; 18:35; 20:2; 41:3; Isa. 9:6) through these verses (cf., 2:7, 11). This proverb and the entire unit find their fulfillment in Jesus Christ (see Ps. 7:21, 2, 4; Isa. 16:4b-5:1; Thess. 1:10).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 20:28).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus guides leaders with the faith to seek out and obey His wisdom</u>. Jesus guides faithful leaders through grace, mercy, and truth. “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before You.” (Ps. 89:14). He will also be loyal to keep His promises (Nu. 23:19; Ps. 33:11; 89:33-34; 1 Sam. 15:29; 2 Sam. 7:15). Jesus is the fulfillment of these promises. He will never break His promises. “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.” (Matt. 24:35; Titus 1:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient to Jesus’ Church by working together with people of all ages</u>. To honor Jesus with holy conduct, you must work in unity with others. Every believer, both young and old, must work together. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>The glory of young men is their strength, and the honor of old men is their gray hair.”</em> (Prov. 20:29). “The lesson here is the respect due each age. Both ages of men are necessary for the profit and safety of a nation, church, or family. God early commanded honor for old men (<a href="https://ref.ly/Lev%2019.32;kjv1900?t=biblia">Lev 19:32</a>), and despising the infirmities of old age is wrong (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2023.22;kjv1900?t=biblia">Pr 23:22</a>). Applying the rule to women, it is older women who are to teach younger women; though younger women are beautiful and fertile, they are inexperienced with husbands and children (<a href="https://ref.ly/Titus%202.3-5;kjv1900?t=biblia">Titus 2:3-5</a>). Therefore, young men (or women) should reverence the older ones for their wisdom, especially when in authority (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job%2032.4-7;kjv1900?t=biblia">Job 32:4-7</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph%206.1-3;kjv1900?t=biblia">Eph 6:1-3</a>). It is God’s judgment when the young rebel and oppress their elders (<a href="https://ref.ly/Job%2030.1-12;kjv1900?t=biblia">Job 30:1-12</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Isa%203.1-5;kjv1900?t=biblia">Is 3:1-5</a>). Paul told Timothy to treat older men with reverence and younger men with respect (<a href="https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%205.1;kjv1900?t=biblia">I Tim 5:1</a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1%20Pet%205.5;kjv1900?t=biblia">I Pet 5:5</a>). Old men should appreciate young men, who are capable of doing things they no longer can or will do. David had been a giant-killer in his youth, but a day came when he was thankful for young men to take over (<a href="https://ref.ly/2%20Sam%2021.16-17;kjv1900?t=biblia">II Sam 21:16-17</a>). Faithful young men agreeable to your cause can be of great value in doing the things your mind can plan. Children of the youth, like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, are valuable assets (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ps%20127.4;kjv1900?t=biblia">Ps 127:4</a>). And old men should not despise qualified young men, whom God has put in office (<a href="https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%204.12;kjv1900?t=biblia">I Tim 4:12</a>). But both ages of men must seek godliness more than anything else. (LetGodbeTrue, Prov. 20:29).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be obedient to serve with your gifting, abilities, and wisdom</u>. Every person in the Church has an essential function, both young and old. “For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.” (1 Cor. 12:12; Ro. 12:4-5). But those who have walked in Jesus’ wisdom for years should become trusted advisors to the young and others in need. “A gray head is a crown of glory; it is found in the way of righteousness.” (Prov. 16:31; Lev. 19:32; Job 12:12). “You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders;...” (1 Pet. 5:5). “Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father, …,” (1 Tim. 5:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey Jesus’ discipline when you sin</u>. Because every person is a sinner, Solomon concluded by urging believers to accept Yahweh’s discipline when you sin. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>Bruising wounds clean away evil, and blows cleanse the innermost parts.”</em> (Prov. 20:30). “Chastening is of the Lord. Blueness [bruising] here is speaking of the severity of the chastening. When we receive a stern rebuke by the Lord it will surely hurt, but the true value will be seen when we get our lives cleaned up.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 20:30).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God disciplines sinners out of love to restore their walk with Him</u>. Solomon warned his sons that they would regret their decisions if they ignored his warnings (Prov. 5:12). Solomon also advised his children that Yahweh disciplines out of love the same way a parent disciplines a child. “My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD or loathe His rebuke, for whom the LORD loves He disciplines, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.” (Prov. 3:11-12; 12:1; 15:5, 31; 19:20; 29:1). Those who accept and learn from God’s discipline, even if painful, will be blessed. “Behold, happy is the person whom God disciplines, so do not reject the discipline of the Almighty. For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, but His hands also heal.” (Job 5:17-18). “For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.” (Heb. 12:11).</p></li>
