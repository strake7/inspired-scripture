<p><u>Introduction</u>: In Psalm 108, David quoted from his prior Psalms 57:7-11 and 60:5-12 to advise believers how to survive their trials by turning to God. God knows that we are prone to look to worldly solutions when we face a trial. Thus, some messages are worth repeating. No matter how intense the trial, God wants you to: (1) persevere, (2) be grateful, (3) worship Him, (4) submit to Him, (5) seek His guidance, (6) have faith, and (7) depend upon Him for deliverance.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, although he faced constant attacks, David persevered in his faith. Even though you will face many trials during your life, God wants you to also persevere in your faith. <u>Second</u>, when faced with a trial, David thanked God before others for His loving mercy. To ensure that you rely upon God’s strength and not your own, God also wants you to give thanks for His love and mercy when you face a trial. <u>Third</u>, During his trials, David sought to ensure that God received the glory through worship. During your trials, God also wants you to worship Him to ensure that your heart remains properly focused on Him. <u>Fourth</u>, when faced with battles, David also trusted in God’s sovereignty and obeyed Him. When you face a trial, trust that God is in control, and let your obedience be the fruit of your faith. <u>Fifth</u>, David stated that Israel could not conquer the nations unless it followed God’s will. During your trials, God also wants you to turn to Him for guidance. <u>Sixth</u>, David had the faith to know that only God could deliver His people. God also wants you to look to Him alone for deliverance and not to powerful leaders or government. <u>Finally</u>, David declared that the Jews would prevail against their enemies through God. During a trial, God also wants you to have the faith to depend upon Him, and let Him fight your battles.</p>
<h2 id="perseverance-during-a-trial-persevere-in-your-faith.-ps.-1081a."><strong>1. <u>Perseverance: During a Trial, Persevere in Your Faith</u>. Ps. 108:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David professed that he would not give up in the face of continuous enemy attacks</u>. Because the threats against him were ongoing, David promised to persevere in his faith: “<em>A Song, a Psalm of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> My heart is steadfast, God; . . .</em>” (Ps. 108:1a). In summarizing the message of this psalm, one commentator observes: “<em>Because God’s Word guarantees it, those who are steadfast in the faith may be confident that God’s faithful love will deliver them from the adversary so that the LORD will be exalted all over the world</em>.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 108) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> God also wants you to persevere in your faith. When you do, you also become a light to the lost around you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David persevered through his many trials</u>. As our example, David frequently professed that he would continue to trust God during his trials: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>My heart is steadfast</em>, God, my heart is steadfast; . . .” (Ps. 57:7a). In describing a “blessed man,” the Psalms state that: “He will not fear bad news; <em>his heart is steadfast</em>, trusting in the LORD.” (Ps. 112:7). Even if your trials feel like they never end, God also wants you to persevere in your faith.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God use your trials to build perseverance and draw you closer to Him</u>. God likely allowed David to suffer so that he would have a deeper faith in Him. Your trials should also produce perseverance and build up your faith in God to deliver you: “And not only this, but we also celebrate in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;” (Ro. 5:3). “Consider it all joy, my brothers and sisters, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.” (Jam. 1:2-3; 2 Cor. 1:8-10). Are you trusting Jesus to protect you during your trials?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek God’s fellowship for the strength to persevere</u>. David also frequently pleaded for the strength to endure: “Lift up the light of Your face upon us, LORD!” (Ps. 4:6b). Other psalms also contain similar pleas: “God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us— Selah” (Ps. 67:1). “God, restore us and make Your face shine upon us, and we will be saved.” (Ps. 80:3). These psalms were based upon Aaron’s prayer of blessing: “The LORD cause His face to shine on you, and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up His face to you, and give you peace.” (Nu. 6:25-26). With each of the prayers, the request involved a plea for the blessings of God’s fellowship. With God’s fellowship, He will give you the strength to endure any trial (Phil. 4:13).</p></li>

<h2 id="gratitude-let-your-gratitude-be-a-part-of-your-testimony.-ps.-1081b-4."><strong>2. <u>Gratitude: Let Your Gratitude Be a Part of Your Testimony</u>. Ps. 108:1b-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David sang songs of gratitude to God for all the nations to hear</u>. As our example, David focused on thanking God before the nations for His loving mercy: “<strong><sup>1b</sup></strong> <em>I will sing, I will sing praises also with my soul. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!</em> <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>I will give thanks to You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to You among the nations. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For Your mercy is great above the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the skies</em>.” (Ps. 108:1b-4). “David directed his praise to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. Yet he was praising Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel (<strong>the peoples</strong>) or <strong>among the nations</strong>. His praise was not secret, but open and public. . . .The large audience was appropriate because of the large nature of God’s great <strong>mercy</strong> (<em>hesed</em>, lovingkindness, loyal love, or covenant love). David understood that the <strong>mercy</strong> of God was so great that if it were to be measured, it would extend <strong>above the heavens</strong>, and His <strong>truth </strong>would reach<strong> to the clouds</strong>.” (David Guzik on Ps. 108) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be grateful for Jesus’ loving mercy</u>. According to the NASB, NKJV, and KJV, David gave thanks for God’s limitless mercy: “<em><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For Your mercy is great above the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the skies</em>.” (Ps. 108:4). According to the NIV, he gave thanks for God’s limitless love: “<em>For great is your love,</em> higher than the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.” It was only out of love and mercy, that God forgave the Jews’ sins and helped them to prevail against their enemies. As our example, many of David’s psalms or Solomon’s proverbs express gratitude for their undeserved deliverance from their enemies:  “A Psalm of David.  I will extol You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.”  (Ps. 30:1).  “A Psalm of David.  The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?  The LORD is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread?”  (Ps. 27:1). “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”  (Ps. 23:4). “Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.” (Ps. 105:2). “My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me.”  (Ps. 144:2).  “But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.”  (Ps. 3:3).  “On God my salvation and my glory rest; the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.”  (Ps. 62:7). “The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9).  “The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runs into it and is safe.” (Prov. 18:10).  If you feel under attack, give thanks for God’s love, mercy, and grace in delivering you from the enemy.</p></li>

<p>Let your praise be a light to the lost<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give God the best you have to offer, and trust Him to do the rest</u>. David proclaimed “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn!</em>” (Ps. 108:2). This meant that worship would be his first act of the day. He would not wait to worship or make God his last priority. “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for people,” (Col. 3:23). If you devote yourself to God and give Him the best of your time, talent, and treasure, He will protect you, keep you on the right path, and He will provide for you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let your gratitude be a light to the lost</u>. David also praised God amongst the nations: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>I will give thanks to You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to You among the nations.</em>” (Ps. 108:3; 57:9). You are the only Bible that some may ever read. If non-believers see bitterness in your walk, you will likely repulse them. But if you respond to adversity with gratitude towards God, others will likely be attracted to God’s light within you. “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;” (Matt. 5:14). In reference to verse three, Charles Spurgeon observes: “<em>I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people.</em> Whoever may come to hear me, devout or profane, believer or heathen, civilized or barbarian, I shall not cease my music. David seemed inspired to foresee that his Psalms would be sung in every land, from Greenland’s icy mountains to India’s coral strand. His heart was large, he would have the whole race of man listen to his joy in God, and lo, he has his desire, for his psalmody is cosmopolitan; no poet is so universally known as he.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 108:3) (italics in original).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="worship-during-a-trial-turn-to-god-and-worship-him.-ps.-1085-6."><strong>3. <u>Worship: During a Trial, Turn to God and Worship Him</u>. Ps. 108:5-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David turned to God and worshiped Him</u>. During his trials, David also worshiped God and sought to ensure that He received the glory: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Be exalted above the heavens, God, and may Your glory be above all the earth. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>So that Your beloved may be rescued, save with Your right hand, and answer me!</em>” (Ps. 108:5-6). In your worship, God wants you to keep your eyes on Him, not yourself. This helps to alleviate your stress and anxieties.</p></li>

<p>Seek to have any trial result in God’s holy name being glorified<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Glorify God during your trials</u>. David proclaimed: “<em>Be exalted above the heavens, God, and may Your glory be above all the earth.</em>” (Ps. 108:5). He always tried to give God the glory: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Be exalted above the heavens, God; may Your glory be above all the earth.” (Ps. 57:5, 11). “A Psalm of David. LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth, You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!” (Ps. 8:1). When seeking deliverance for yourself or for others, pray that God is glorified in the process. “Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.” (Col. 3:17). If God delivers you or others and you take the glory for yourself, you are taking that which does not belong to you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He is faithful to keep His promises</u>. As a man of faith, David led the Jews with both psalms and songs of praise and worship: “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His faithfulness is everlasting.” (1 Chr. 16:34) “Then David and all Israel played music before God with all their might, with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets.” (1 Chr. 13:8). “Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations, LORD, and I will sing praises to Your name.” (Ps. 18:49). “That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent. LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever.” (Ps. 30:12). “In God we have boasted all day long, and we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah” (Ps. 44:8). “So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture will give thanks to You forever; to all generations we will tell of Your praise.” (Ps. 79:13). “I will sing of the graciousness of the LORD forever; to all generations I will make Your faithfulness known with my mouth.” (Ps. 89:1).The psalms also encourage believers to express their praise to God with worship music: “It is good to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to Your name, Most High; to declare Your goodness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night, with the ten-stringed lute and with the harp, with resounding music on the lyre. For You, LORD, have made me joyful by what You have done, I will sing for joy over the works of Your hands.” (Ps. 92:104; Ps. 150:3-6). Does your devotion to God include heartfelt worship?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Even when things appear hopeless, turn to God with praise</u>. Daniel once faced a seemingly hopeless circumstance when a Babylonian King signed his death warrant. As our example, Daniel took his worries off of himself by praising God: “Now when Daniel learned that the document was signed, he entered his house (and in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously.” (Dan. 6:10). You should also respond to any trial by praising God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God in all circumstances</u>. The Apostle Paul praised God when he was thrown into prison. He exhorted believers to praise God in every circumstance: “I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,” (1 Cor. 1:4) “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20). “in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.” (Col. 3:17). Are you praising God during good times and during your trials?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God in your suffering because your suffering is likely for His greater good</u>. God allowed David to suffer in the wilderness so that he would learn to cling to Him and trust Him. God also wanted to humble David so that he would not become prideful when God later exalted him. Just as God allowed David to suffer for His greater good, He also allows you to suffer for His greater good as well (Ro. 8:28). Just as David later praised God in his suffering, so should you. “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.” (Ja. 1:2-3). The only exception to this rule is if you have brought suffering upon yourself because of your sins. Yet, even in the case of sin, your suffering serves God’s greater purpose if it brings you to repentance. If you are suffering, sing God’s praises and give thanks. He may be molding you for something great.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-submit-to-god-your-sovereign-and-holy-creator.-ps.-1087-9."><strong>4. <u>Submission: Submit to God, Your Sovereign and Holy Creator.</u> Ps. 108:7-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed God’s holiness and His sovereignty over all the nations</u>. David declared that God is holy and sovereign. He would ensure that His will and His Word are fulfilled in conquering certain nations: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>God has spoken in His holiness: ‘I will triumph, I will divide up Shechem, and measure out the Valley of Succoth. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet of My head; Judah is My scepter</em>. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Moab is My washbowl; I will throw My sandal over Edom; I will shout aloud over Philistia</em>.” (Ps. 108:7-9). God’s holy name will one day be glorified amongst the nations: “So all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will be afraid of you.” (Dt. 28:10). Although David temporarily conquered the nations surrounding Israel, Jesus will come to permanently establish His perfect sovereign rule over all the nations: “Jesus, the new David, will lead God’s people in praise, and Rev 19 shows how He will accomplish the new conquest. The God who is worthy of praise will exalt Himself over all the nations, establish His rule over all the earth, and answer all the pleas of His people.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 108).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your faith should produce the fruit of obedience</u>. God would ensure that His will was completed in defeating the pagan nations around Israel. But He required that the Jews have the faith and obedience to show up to the battle. When Moses gave God’s Law, he urged the Jews to commit to following all of it, not just the parts that they agreed with: “So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.” (Dt. 5:32). “and do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.” (Dt. 28:14). “Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:7). “Do not turn to the right nor to the left; turn your foot from evil.” (Prov. 4:27). King Josiah was later celebrated because his faith produced the fruit of complete obedience. “He did what was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of his father David and did not turn aside to the right or the left.” (2 Chr. 34:2; 2 Kgs. 22:2). Do you follow all of God’s Word? Or, do you choose only the parts of God’s Word that you agree with?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. Without works, a person’s faith is dead: “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” (Jam. 2:17). A believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. But Jesus is not your Lord if you disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt. 7:26). Is your faith evidenced through obedience to Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Regardless of the reasons for your suffering, stay obedient to God</u>. God will bless those with the faith to obey Him. “For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, by having served and by still serving the saints.” (Heb. 6:10). But you should never demand a blessing because of your obedience. You should also never allow your suffering to cause you to give up on following God’s Word: “The snares of the wicked have surrounded me, but I have not forgotten Your Law. . . Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do not forget Your statutes.” (Ps. 119:61, 83). “So that they would put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God, but comply with His commandments,” (Ps. 78:7). Even when he suffered, Job continued to obey God: “My foot has held on to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside.” (Job 23:11). Thus, your obedience should not be conditioned on what you expect to receive or on how you feel when God calls upon you.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidance-in-all-circumstances-seek-his-guidance.-ps.-10810-11."><strong>5. <u>Guidance: In All Circumstances, Seek His Guidance</u>. Ps. 108:10-11.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David sought God’s guidance to move from defeat to victory</u>. David used rhetorical questions to show that Israel could not conquer the nations unless it followed God’s will: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>God, have You Yourself not rejected us? And will You not go forth with our armies, God?</em>” (Ps. 108:10-11). In Psalm 60, David made a similar plea for guidance: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Who will bring me into the besieged city? Who will lead me to Edom?” (Ps. 60:9). David knew that it was not by his skill that Israel would turn defeat into victory. Israel could only hope to prevail against their more numerous enemies if God guided them on the correct path.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Consult the Holy Spirit through the Word and prayer in all major decisions</u>.  Believers are also warned against the sin of presumption  (Jam. 4:13-17).  “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.”  (Prov. 14:12).  Today, Jesus has left you with His Word to guide your feet: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”  (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 6:23).  “I know, O LORD, that a man’s way is not in himself, nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps.”  (Jer. 10:23).  He has also left you the Holy Spirit to apply His Word:  “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;”  (Jo. 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7; Ro. 8:26).  He will also guide you in prayer when you seek wisdom:  “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.”  (Ja. 1:5.)  Are you seeking His guidance through the Word and prayer?</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-in-all-circumstances-never-lose-your-faith-in-him.x-ps.-10812."><strong>6. <u>Faith: In All Circumstances, Never Lose Your Faith in Him</u>.x Ps. 108:12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David proclaimed that God alone would rescue Israel from its defeats</u>. Even though he was a hero to the Jews, David declared that only God could bring His people victory: “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Give us help against the enemy, for deliverance by man is worthless</em>.” (Ps. 108:12). In Psalm 60, David made a similar claim: “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Oh give us help against the enemy, for rescue by man is worthless.” (Ps. 60:11). True deliverance does not come from human leaders or government. It instead comes from the Messiah Jesus Christ.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-108/media/image3.jpg" style="width:6.00663in;height:2.988in" alt="32 Bible verses about Salvation Not By Works" /></p>
<p>During your trials, turn to Jesus for your deliverance<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith in God requires trust in Him alone, not in powerful people or your own strength</u>. David knew not to place his trust in himself or in his own armies: “<em>for deliverance by man is worthless</em>.” (Ps. 108:12; 60:11). “Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). “This is what the LORD says: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the LORD.”’ (Jer. 17:5). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in people.” (Ps. 118:8). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength.” (Ps. 33:16). “For I will not trust in my bow, nor will my sword save me.” (Ps. 44:6). “and that this entire assembly may know that the LORD does not save by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will hand you over to us!” (1 Sam. 17:47). If you face a difficult situation, don’t rely upon your own strengths and abilities. Nor does God want you to put your faith in powerful people to deliver you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>All things are possible with God when you have faith</u>. There is no request that is beyond God’s power: “Is anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14(a)). “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” (Jer. 32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). “‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26(b); Mk. 10:27(b); Lk. 1:37; Ro. 8:31). With faith, God can deliver you from any evil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God calls upon you to be patient as He molds you for His greater plans</u>. True faith also requires patience. The Bible is filled with examples of believers having to wait before God would fulfill His promises. For example, Sarah and Abraham waited 25 years in the Promised Land before He transformed her 90-year-old womb to allow her to conceive Isaac (Gen. 17:17). David also had to wait to become king as God molded Him as a servant within Saul’s court. He would then suffer under Saul’s rule. If we are patient, God uses suffering to mold believers for His greater glory: “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.” (Is. 48:10; Ps. 66:10; Zech. 13:9(a); Dt. 8:2-3). God also wants you to be patient as He molds you: “Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.” (Ps. 37:7). “I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined to me and heard my cry.” (Ps. 40:1(b)). “I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait, and in His word do I hope.” (Ps. 130:5). Even when you don’t know God’s plan for you, will you patiently wait for God and His timing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. <u>Dependence: During a Trial, Depend Upon God to Strengthen You</u>. Ps. 108:13.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David turned to God to strengthen him for their future battles</u>. David praised God because he knew that God would be faithful in His promises of victory: “<em><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> Through God we will do valiantly, and it is He who will trample down our enemies</em>.” (Ps. 108:13). In Psalm 60, David made an identical proclamation of faith: “<strong><sup>12</sup></strong> Through God we will do valiantly, and it is He who will trample down our enemies.” (Ps. 60:12). “We must do our part, but we can do nothing of ourselves; it is only <em>through God that we shall do valiantly</em>. Blessed Paul will own that even he can <em>do nothing</em>, nothing to purpose, <em>but through Christ strengthening him</em>, Phil. 4:13.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 108:13).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>David regularly depended upon God for his deliverance</u>. As our example, David depended upon God to allow him to prevail against his enemies. “<em>Through You we will push back our adversaries; through Your name we will trample down those who rise up against us</em>.” (Ps. 44:5). “For You have encircled me with strength for battle; You have forced those who rose up against me to bow down under me.” (2 Sam. 22:40). He also praised God before God intervened on his behalf: “We will sing for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the LORD fulfill all your desires.” (Ps. 20:5). “But know that the LORD has set apart the godly person for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.” (Ps. 4:3). “Leave me, all you who practice injustice, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.” (Ps. 6:8). “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears, . . . He also brought me out into an open place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.” (Ps. 18:6, 19). “Blessed be the LORD, because He has heard the sound of my pleading.” (Ps. 28:6). “By this I know that You are pleased with me, because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.” (Ps. 41:11). “Then my enemies will turn back on the day when I call; this I know, that God is for me.” (Ps. 56:9). “Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will reach out with Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will save me.” (Ps. 138:7). When you do God’s will, no enemy can stop you: “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). Do you also praise God for answering your prayers before He responds?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Depend upon God in times of crisis by making Him your source of refuge</u>. David also frequently praised God for the blessings that came from placing his trust in Him: “How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!” (Ps. 2:12b) “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “A Psalm of David. In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee as a bird to your mountain?”’ (Ps. 11:1). “A Mikhtam of David. Protect me, God, for I take refuge in You.” (Ps. 16:1). “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings.” (Ps. 17:8). “Taste and see that the LORD is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!” (Ps. 34:8). “The LORD redeems the souls of His servants, and none of those who take refuge in Him will suffer for their guilt.” (Ps. 34:22). “How precious is Your mercy, God! And the sons of mankind take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.” (Ps. 36:7). “<sup>5 </sup>I cried out to You, O Lord; I said, ‘You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. <sup>6 </sup>Give heed to my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. <sup>7 </sup>Bring my soul out of prison, so that I may give thanks to Your name; the righteous will surround me, for You will deal bountifully with me.”’ (Ps. 142:5-6). “May the LORD reward your work, and may your wages be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” (Ruth 2:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let Jesus be your refuge in the wilderness</u>. Jesus is called the chief shepherd (1 Pet. 5:4), the good shepherd (Jo. 10:11), and the great shepherd (Heb. 13:20). It is in Him that we “have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.” (Heb. 6:18). “The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). “Each will be like a refuge from the wind and a shelter from the storm, like streams of water in a dry country, like the shade of a huge rock in a parched land.” (Is. 32:2). Have you turned to Jesus as your refuge when it seems that everyone is set against you?</p></li>
