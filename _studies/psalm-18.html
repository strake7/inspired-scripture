<h1 id="psalm-18-lessons-from-david-regarding-reasons-to-praise-god">Psalm 18: Lessons From David Regarding Reasons to Praise God</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the fourth longest psalm, with only psalms 78, 89, and 119 exceeding it in length. This psalm most likely takes place between Saul’s death and David’s ordination (1 Sam. 31-2 Sam. 5). It records David’s praise for God’s protection, His deliverance, and His faithfulness. Here, the Bible reveals seven reasons to praise God. He is a God of: (1) protection, (2) sovereignty, (3) love, (4) justice, (5) guidance, (6) deliverance, and (7) faithfulness.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, David praised God for answering his prayers to protect him from his many enemies. You can also praise God for answering your prayers for protection. <u>Second</u>, David praised God because he is all-powerful and used His power to protect him. You can also praise God because He is all-powerful, in control, and He uses His power to protect you from evil. <u>Third</u>, David praised God because God protected him out of love. You can also praise God because He is not a cold and distant God. He loves you as well. <u>Fourth</u>, David praised God because he was just and fair in rewarding David for his faith. You can also praise God because He is just and fair in His dealings with you. <u>Fifth</u>, David praised God for His guidance and molding. You can also praise God because He also guides you and molds you. <u>Sixth</u>, David praised God for delivering him and granting him victory over his enemies. You can also praise God because He delivers you from evil. <u>Finally</u>, David praised God for keeping His promises to make him King of Israel to serve God. You can also praise God because He is faithful to keep His many promises to you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for answering his prayers to protect him from his many enemies</u>. Near the time David became King, he praised God for answering his prayers to becoming his shield of protection, his refuge, his strength, and his hope when others tried to kill him: “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> praised for rescuing David. For the music director. A Psalm of David, the servant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who spoke to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the words of this song on the day that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said, ‘I love You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my strength.’ <sup>2 </sup>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is my rock and my fortress and my savior, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. <sup>3 </sup>I call upon the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies. <sup>4 </sup>The ropes of death encompassed me, and the torrents of destruction terrified me. <sup>5 </sup>The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me. <sup>6 </sup>In my distress I called upon the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and cried to my God for help; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears</em>.” (Ps. 18:1-6). David recorded a similar praise for God’s protection and answered prayers in 2 Samuel 22:5-7. On many occasions, Saul’s troops or the Philistines surrounded or captured David. Death would have felt inevitable. Yet, instead of fighting back, David cried and pleaded with God to save him. When God saved him from certain death, David responded with gratitude by declaring his love for God: “<em>I love You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>” (Ps. 18:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is a shield to those who take refuge in Him</u>. David praised God as his “shield” and his refuge: “<em>My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.”</em> (Ps. 18:2). “He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (2 Sam. 22:31). “But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.” (Ps. 3:3). “For it is You who blesses the righteous man, O LORD, You surround him with favor as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12). From David’s example, his son Solomon also called God his shield: “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5). When God is your refuge, He is also your shield.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you trust in God and do His will, you have no reason to fear your enemies</u>. Because God was David’s rock and his refuge, he never feared his enemies: “I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about.” (Ps. 3:6). “Though a host encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war arise against me, in spite of this I shall be confident.” (Ps. 27:3). When Goliath approached David, David charged at him without fear: “Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.” (1 Sam. 17:48). If you are walking in faith in Jesus, you have no reason to fear your enemies. “And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant—” (Lk. 1:69). If you fear any enemy, give that fear to Jesus.</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-god-because-he-is-all-powerful-and-in-control.-ps.-187-15.">2. <u>Sovereignty: Praise God Because He is All-Powerful and in Control</u>. Ps. 18:7-15.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God because he is all-powerful and uses His power to keep His Word</u>. David used imagery of the most powerful forces in nature to describe God’s tremendous power, and how He uses this power as the sovereign Creator to fulfill His promises: “<sup>7 </sup><em>Then the earth shook and quaked; and the foundations of the mountains were trembling and were shaken, because He was angry. <sup>8 </sup>Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire from His mouth was devouring; coals burned from it. <sup>9 </sup>He also bowed the heavens down low, and came down with thick darkness under His feet. <sup>10 </sup>He rode on a cherub and flew; and He sped on the wings of the wind. <sup>11 </sup>He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, darkness of waters, thick clouds. <sup>12 </sup>From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, hailstones and coals of fire. <sup>13</sup> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire. <sup>14 </sup>He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, and lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them. <sup>15 </sup>Then the channels of water appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed by Your rebuke, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.”</em> (Ps. 18:7-15; 2 Sam. 22:8-16). David bolstered his faith as he described God’s omnipotent power in anthropological terms. David knew that there was no problem that was too big for the Creator of the universe to solve. God was so eager to use His power to rescue David and demonstrate His faithfulness that David perceived the ground shake when God intervened to help him (Ps. 18:7; 2 Sam. 22:8).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God wants to use His power to help you as well</u>. Other psalms also refer to God’s awesome power: “The earth quaked; the heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God; Sinai itself quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel.” (Ps. 66:8). Moses used similar terms to describe God’s mighty power when He appeared at Mount Horeb / Sinai: “Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently. When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.” (Ex. 19:18-19). The judge Deborah also used similar words in her song of deliverance to describe God: “LORD, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the field of Edom, the earth quaked, the heavens also dripped, even the clouds dripped water. The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD, this Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.” (Jdgs. 5:4-5). “Mountains quake because of Him and the hills dissolve; indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence, the world and all the inhabitants in it.” (Nahum 1:5; Is. 64:1; Hab. 3:3-15). God further uses His power to protect His people: “Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel.” (1 Sam. 7:10). He also wants to help you as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s voice carries power like thunder</u>. David stated that “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also thundered in the heavens,</em> . . .” (Ps. 18:13). In David’s song of deliverance, he also stated: “<mark>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered His voice.” (2 Sam. 22:14). “The voice of the LORD is on the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD is over many waters.” (Ps. 29:3). Hannah also declared in her prayer: “Those who contend with the LORD will be terrified; against them He will thunder in the heavens, the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed.” (1 Sam. 2:10). Jeremiah also declared: “When He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens, and He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings out wind from His storehouses.” (Jer. 51:16). In the book of Job, Elihu also stated of God:</mark> “<mark>Its thundering voice declares His presence; the livestock also, concerning what is coming</mark> up<mark>.” (Job 36:33).</mark> “At this also my heart trembles, and leaps from its place. Listen closely to the thunder of His voice, and the rumbling that goes out from His mouth. Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, and His lightning travels to the ends of the earth. After it, a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, and He does not restrain the lightning when His voice is heard.” (Job 37:1-4)<mark>. These persons stood in awe of God’s power.</mark></p></li>
<li><p><mark><u>God deserves your awe and wonder</u>.</mark> Moses referred to God as awe inspiring or “awesome”: “You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and <em>awesome God</em>.” (Dt. 7:21). The psalmists also referred to God as being awesome: in glory, power, and majesty: “Say to God, ‘<em>How awesome are Your works</em>! . . . . Come and see the works of God, <em>who is awesome</em> in His deeds toward the sons of men.”’ (Ps. 66:3, 5). “O God, <em>You are awesome</em> from Your sanctuary. The God of Israel Himself gives strength and power to the people. Blessed be God!” (Ps. 68:35). “Men shall speak of the power of <em>Your awesome acts</em>, and I will tell of Your greatness.” (Ps. 145:6; 106:22; Is. 64:3). “For the LORD most high is to be feared, a great King over all the earth.” (Ps. 47:2). “I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed and said, ‘Alas, <em>O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep His commandments</em>,”’ (Dan. 9:4). <mark>“Dominion and awe belong to Him who makes peace in His heights.” (Job 25:2).</mark> Many people casually use the term “awesome” to express approval for a good outcome to a situation. But this misuses a word that was reserved for praise for God’s amazing power. In your prayers, are you professing awe at God’s amazing power?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to God’s power to boost your faith in times when it is weak</u>. Like David, God wants you to trust in His absolute power to solve your problems. He also wants you to boost your faith by including similar praises for His mighty power in your prayers and praises (Ro. 10:17). ‘“Ah Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,’ . . . ‘Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”’ (Jer. 32:17, 27). “And looking at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26; Gen. 18:14). If God does not respond to your prayer requests, it may be because you are asking amiss or it is not His will. Yet, if He does not respond, it will never be because He lacks the power to do so.</p></li>

<h2 id="love-praise-god-because-he-uses-his-power-to-save-you-out-of-love.-ps.-1816-19.">3. <u>Love: Praise God Because He Uses His Power to Save You Out of Love</u>. Ps. 18:16-19.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God because God protected him out of love for him</u>. David knew that God is not distant and uncaring. Instead, he celebrated God for His intense love for him: “<sup>16 </sup><em>He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. <sup>17 </sup>He saved me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. <sup>18 </sup>They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was my support. <sup>19 </sup>He also brought me out into an open place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me</em>.” (Ps. 18:16-19; 2 Sam. 22:17-20). Many perceive God as being distant. But this is not who God is. David knew that God loved him and delighted in David’s fellowship. God also wants you to know that He loves you and wants your fellowship as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also loves you and delights in your fellowship</u>. Like David, God loves you and delights to have you in fellowship with Him: “It will no longer be said to you, ‘Forsaken,’ nor to your land will it any longer be said, ‘Desolate’; but you will be called, ‘My delight is in her,’ and your land, ‘Married’; <em>for the LORD delights in you</em>, and to Him your land will be married.” (Is. 62:4). “Whereas you have been forsaken and hated with no one passing through, <em>I will make you an everlasting pride</em>, a joy from generation to generation.” (Is. 60:15). “The LORD your God is in your midst, a victorious warrior. <em>He will exult over you with joy</em>, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.” (Zeph. 3:17). Thus, our God is not a cold or distant Creator.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God loves you so much that He sent His only Son to die for you</u>. Jesus’ death on the cross is a testament to God the Father’s loving character and His desire to be reconciled to you: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” (Jo. 10:11). “Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.” (Jo. 15:13). “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Ro. 5:8). Jesus does not merely want to save you. He wants to delight in your fellowship, symbolized by His desire to dine with you: ‘“Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.” (Rev. 3:20). Are you seeking out His love and fellowship?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="justice-praise-god-because-he-is-just-and-fair-in-his-dealings-with-you.-ps.-1820-27.">4. <u>Justice: Praise God Because He is Just and Fair in His Dealings With You</u>. Ps. 18:20-27.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God because he was just and fair in rewarding David for his faith</u>. Although David committed many sins, he was a man of faith who repented of his sins. He praised God because he knew that God would be just and fair in dealing with him: “<sup>20 </sup><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me. <sup>21 </sup>For I have kept the ways of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and have not acted wickedly against my God. <sup>22 </sup>For all His judgments were before me, and I did not put away His statutes from me. <sup>23 </sup>I was also blameless with Him, and I kept myself from my wrongdoing. <sup>24 </sup>Therefore the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has repaid me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes. <sup>25 </sup>With the faithful You show Yourself faithful; with the blameless You prove Yourself blameless; <sup>26 </sup>with the pure You show Yourself pure, and with the crooked You show Yourself astute. <sup>27 </sup>For You save an afflicted people, but You humiliate haughty eyes</em>.” (Ps. 18:20-27; 2 Sam. 22:21-28). This psalm took place before David’s adultery with Bathsheba and his murder of Uriah to cover up his action (2 Sam. 11). With exception of David’s multiple wives, David walked at this time in Spirit-led obedience to God’s Commandments, His statutes and His ordinances when he first became king. But God did not grant David eternal salvation because of his obedience. He was a sinner. Yet, David correctly praised God for His fairness and His just character for rewarding David’s Spirit-led obedience when he walked in obedience. Your obedience also will not result in your salvation. Only your faith in Jesus’ atoning death on the cross will do that. But, like David, God will also keep His promises to reward you when your faith produces the fruit of obedience (Dt. 28:1-4). Conversely, without taking away your salvation, God may remove His hedge of protection and allow you to experience Satan’s curses when you rebel (Dt. 28:15-68).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God did not exalt David or the Jews because of their personal righteousness</u>. Like David, every person is a sinner (Ecc. 7:20). Thus, Moses warned the Jews not to assume that God had exalted them because of their righteousness. “Do not say in your heart when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has driven them out before you, ‘Because of my righteousness the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has brought me in to possess this land,’ but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is dispossessing them before you. It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is driving them out before you, in order to confirm the oath which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Know, then, it is not because of your righteousness that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people.” (Dt. 9:4-6). But God still blessed the Jews when their faith led to their obedience.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God blessed David with mercy because he was merciful</u>. David showed mercy on many occasions. For example, on two separate occasions, he spared Saul from death when Saul was pursuing David and trying to kill him (1 Sam. 24:10-13; 26:7-11). He also spared Shimei when he had an opportunity to kill him (2 Sam. 16:7-12). God was fair and just to show David the same mercy that David showed to his enemies (2 Sam. 22:26; Ps. 18:25; Prov. 11:17). “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.” (Matt. 5:7; Jam. 2:13). God will also be merciful to you when you show mercy to others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God exalted David as king because David was a humble servant</u>. David praised God for sparing <em>“an afflicted people”</em> while abasing <em>“the haughty”.</em> (2 Sam. 22:28). David grew up a humble shepherd. He then served as a humble servant to Saul. He then served Israel as a humble outcast when Saul pursued him and tried to kill him. Because David was humble in his service and even in his victories, God rewarded him by exalting him to become the King of Israel. Like he did with David and his enemies, God will resist those who are prideful and exalt those who are humble. “A man’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:10). “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” (Lk. 14:11). “Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,” (1 Pet. 5:6). If you are humble, God will also bless you by exalting you in heaven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also blessed David with forgiveness</u>. Although most believe that David wrote these words before he committed his terrible sins of adultery and murder, God forgave David when he repented (2 Sam. 12:13). David and Israel would still suffer the consequences of these sins. But God created a clean heart in David after he repented of his sins and later healed the land. “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chron. 7:14). This was another one of God’s blessings. If you repent, He will also bless you by forgiving you (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus can also clean your heart of sin and allow you to go boldly into the throne room</u>. David spoke with boldness regarding his righteousness. “Who may ascend into the hill of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? And who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and righteousness from the God of his salvation.” (Ps. 23:3-5). Unfortunately, David’s ability to speak boldly in God’s righteousness would not last because of his sins. Unlike David, you can act with boldness before God, even if you have committed terrible sins. Through His death on the cross, Jesus has made you blameless with His righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21). Through His righteousness, you can then approach God the Father in the throne room in boldness as you pray for others (Heb. 4:16). Are you praying boldly for others?</p></li>
<li><p><u>21 specific blessings in the Torah for those who are faithful and obedient to God</u>. In the four books of the law, God reveals at least 21 specific blessings for those who are faithful and obedient to Him. These blessings are unrelated to Jesus’ blessings of eternal salvation. In Exodus, God revealed at least three conditional blessings that come from faithful obedience. These include: (1) protection from diseases (Ex. 15:26); (2) a prolonged life (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16, 32-33; 4:40; 6:1-2; 12:28; 22:6-7; 25:13-16; Lev. 18:5; Eph. 6:2-3); and (3) God’s holy presence (Ex. 40:34-35). In Leviticus, God revealed seven other conditional blessings that He may use to bless a person or a nation for obedience. These include: (1) provision (Lev. 26:3-5); (2) peace (Lev. 26:6); (3) protection (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22); (4) fertility (Lev. 26:9); (5) abundance from giving (Lev. 26:10; Ps. 92:12-14; Mal. 3:10-12); (6) guidance (Lev. 26:11-12; Ps. 32:8); and (7) freedom (Lev. 26:13; Ex. 20:2). In Deuteronomy, He revealed 10 other conditional blessings. These include: (1) exaltation for the nation (Dt. 28:1-2); (2) exaltation for the individual within the nation (Dt. 28:1-3); (3) growth (Dt. 28:4); (4) food (Dt. 28:5); (5) success (Dt. 28:6); (6) the defeat of your enemies (Dt. 28:7); (7) prosperity (Dt. 28:8); (8) holiness (Dt. 28:9); (9) respect (Dt. 28:10); and (10) the fullness of God’s blessings (Dt. 28:11-14). Finally, in books of the law from Exodus through Deuteronomy, God reveals the blessing of forgiveness from the blood sacrifices (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). Jesus became the final one-time sacrifice to fulfill the Old Testament sacrificial laws (Heb. 10:12). The only act of obedience required to receive this blessing today is to believe that He died for your sins and that He is both your Lord and Savior (Ro. 10:13; Acts 2:21; Jo. 3:16; 1 Jo. 1:9). Are you obedient to God to receive His many blessings?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for guidance and for molding him</u>. Although he was surrounded by darkness, David praised God for being his light and for molding him for God’s use: “<sup>28 </sup><em>For You light my lamp; the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God illumines my darkness. <sup>29 </sup>For by You I can run at a troop of warriors; and by my God I can leap over a wall. <sup>30 </sup>As for God, His way is blameless; the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is refined; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. <sup>31 </sup>For who is God, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? And who is a rock, except our God, <sup>32 </sup>the God who encircles me with strength, and makes my way blameless? <sup>33 </sup>He makes my feet like deer’s feet, and sets me up on my high places. <sup>34 </sup>He trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <sup>35 </sup>You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your right hand upholds me; and Your gentleness makes me great. <sup>36 </sup>You enlarge my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped</em>.” (Ps. 18:28-36). God also wants to guide and mold you. But you must turn to Him and invite Him to do this.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God will empower you by guiding your path out of darkness</u>. Before praising God for empowering him with strength, David praised God as his “<em>lamp</em>” who “<em>illumines my darkness.</em>” (Ps. 18:28; 2 Sam. 22:29). Before God could use David to defeat his enemies, He first guided David to a place of safety. God, for example, likely guided David to caves to hide as Saul’s army encircled him (1 Sam. 22:31). Thus, David sang God’s praises for guiding him: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). If you read His Word and pray for guidance, God will also guide your path.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is unlikely to give you His wisdom if you boast about yourself</u>. God blessed David with wisdom because David admitted that he was helpless without God: “Thus says the LORD, ‘<em>Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom</em>, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 9:23-24). If you want wisdom, you must humble yourself when you approach God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Meditate upon God's Word</u>. At this point in his life, David memorized God’s Word to keep himself on the right path: “Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You.” (Ps. 119:11). “. . . Your law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40:8; 1:2; 119:16; Jer. 15:16). Solomon also memorized the law: “Bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.” (Prov. 6:21-22; 7:3). Joshua also told the people to meditate day and night on the book of the law (Josh. 1:8). Moses also exhorted the people to internalize God’s Word into their lives: “You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul. . .” (Dt. 11:18). Jesus also memorized the law and quoted it from memory throughout His entire life. In addition to the blessings listed above, the Word will keep your ways pure (Ps. 37:31; 119:9). It will teach and admonish you (Col. 3:16). When you follow it, David promised that you will bear fruit in God like a tree planted by water (Ps. 1:1-3). Are you meditating on God’s Word to receive His guidance?</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-praise-god-because-he-delivers-you-from-evil.-ps.-1837-42.">6. <u>Deliverance: Praise God Because He Delivers You From Evil</u>. Ps. 18:37-42.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for delivering him and granting him victory over his enemies</u>. Despite facing many powerful enemies, David praised God for granting him victory: “<sup>37 </sup><em>I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and I did not turn back until they were consumed. <sup>38 </sup>I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet. <sup>39 </sup>For You have encircled me with strength for battle; You have forced those who rose up against me to bow down under me. <sup>40 </sup>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, and I destroyed those who hated me. <sup>41 </sup>They cried for help, but there was no one to save, they cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but He did not answer them. <sup>42 </sup>Then I beat them fine like the dust before the wind; I emptied them out like the mud of the streets</em>.” (Ps. 18:37-42; 2 Sam. 22:29-43). God strengthened David and empowered him because David submitted to God and trusted God in humility. David conceded that his enemies were too strong for him to defeat on his own (Ps. 18:3-6, 41; 2 Sam. 22:4-7, 18). Even when David sinned, he quickly repented and submitted to God. This always allowed God to strengthen David when he confronted his many stronger enemies.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God gave David the talents or skills to defeat his enemies</u>. David gave God credit for all of his skills. He praised God for giving him quickness in battle (2 Sam. 22:34). He also praised God for “train[ing] my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.” (2 Sam. 22:35). He praised God for guiding his shield to block the blows of his adversaries and for keeping his feet from sliding during combat (2 Sam. 22:36-37). He further praised God for giving him the strength to overpower and defeat his enemies (2 Sam. 22:38-40). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11). He also praised God for filling his enemies with terror and causing them to flee from David (2 Sam. 22:41). Finally, David gave God credit for giving him all these skills to obtain complete victories over his enemies (2 Sam. 22:40-43). If God has blessed you with skills, use them for Him and praise Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Find strength in God through your weaknesses</u>. Like David, God wants you to find strength in Him to confront your enemies. “And He has said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.’ Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.” (2 Cor. 12:7-10). Are you boasting in your weakness so that Jesus can strengthen you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Thank God in songs and prayers for your deliverance as well</u>. As an example to you, many of David’s psalms or Solomon’s proverbs contain tributes to God for His deliverance: “A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. A Psalm of David. I will extol You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:1). “A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense of my life; whom shall I dread?” (Ps. 27:1). “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.” (Ps. 23:4). “My lovingkindness and my fortress, My stronghold and my deliverer, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me.” (Ps. 144:2). “But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head.” (Ps. 3:3). “On God my salvation and my glory rest; the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.” (Ps. 62:7). “The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble;” (Ps. 9:9). “The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runs into it and is safe.” (Prov. 18:10). If you feel under attack, give thanks for God’s deliverance.</p></li>

<h2 id="faithfulness-god-is-faithful-and-trustworthy-to-keep-his-promises.-ps.-1843-50.">7. <u>Faithfulness: God is Faithful and Trustworthy to Keep His Promises</u>. Ps. 18:43-50.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David’s praise and amazement for God’s faithfulness in keeping His promises</u>. David’s psalm concluded with praise for God’s faithfulness for keeping His Covenant and promises to make David, God’s anointed King of Israel: “<sup>43 </sup><em>You have rescued me from the contentions of the people; You have placed me as head of the nations; a people whom I have not known serve me. <sup>44 </sup>As soon as they hear, they obey me; foreigners pretend to obey me. <sup>45 </sup>Foreigners lose heart, and come trembling out of their fortresses. <sup>46 </sup>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation, <sup>47 </sup>the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me. <sup>48 </sup>He rescues me from my enemies; You indeed lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from a violent man. <sup>49 </sup>Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and I will sing praises to Your name. <sup>50 </sup>He gives great salvation to His king, and shows faithfulness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever</em>.” (Ps. 18:43-50; 2 Sam. 22:44-51). Without regard for David’s merit, God formed a Covenant with David that the true kingship would run through him and his descendants. This Covenant would last forever with Jesus ultimately fulfilling it (2 Sam. 7:12-16). David faced both domestic and foreign challengers to his reign. But God was always faithful to keep His Word and uphold His Covenant. God also wants you to have faith in his Word. Like David, God wants you to sing His praises to non-believers to bring them to faith.</p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-18/media/image3.jpg" style="width:6.01042in;height:4.71354in" /></p>
<p>Even if your faith fails you, Jesus will keep His promise to you of eternal salvation<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He is faithful even when you are not</u>. David did not deserve to receive an eternal Covenant. His sins were worse than Saul’s sins. But God remained faithful, even when David was not. He will also remain faithful to you when your faith fails you: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Are you singing God’s praises for remaining faithful to you when you are not?</p></li>
<li><p><u>David praised God to the nations around him</u>. In response to God’s faithfulness, David promised to go “<em>among the nations</em>” and “<em>sing praises to Your name.</em>” (Ps. 18:49; 2 Sam. 22:50). He knew that God’s victories were for His glory so that other nations would also bow down in reverence to the true King of Kings. Paul later quoted David to state that he would also proclaim Jesus to the nations: “ . . . as it is written, ‘Therefore I will give praise to you among the gentiles, and I will sing your name.” (Ro. 15:9). In response to Jesus’ faithfulness, will you also praise Him to non-believers (Matt. 28:16-20)? Will you live your life as a living sacrifice of gratitude to Jesus for His death for you (Ro. 12:1-2)?</p></li>
