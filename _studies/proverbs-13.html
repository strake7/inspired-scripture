<p><u>Introduction</u>: In the prologue to Proverbs, Solomon made clear that true wisdom comes from Yahweh (Prov. 2:6). Yahweh is another name for the great “I AM”. In the New Testament, Jesus reveals that He is the great “I AM” (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). The New Testament further reveals that our God-given wisdom comes through Jesus (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 2:3). Jesus also revealed that the entire Old Testament is about Him (Lk. 24:44). His wisdom is a gift that comes from knowing Him as your Lord and Savior (Eph. 1:17). Proverbs 13 reveals several principles for living according to His wisdom. These include: (1) honoring parental discipline, (2) Spirit- led speech, (3) integrity, (4) faith, (5) obedience, (6) fulfilling Jesus’ will, and (7) stewardship.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon stated that a wise son honors his father’s discipline. Such discipline should draw a child closer to Jesus. Believers who seek to live according to Jesus’ wisdom should therefore honor parental discipline that honors Him. <u>Second</u>, in three proverbs, Solomon gives examples of wise people who use their speech for good. Believers seeking to live according to Jesus’ wisdom should follow these principles by letting the Holy Spirit guide their speech. <u>Third</u>, in two proverbs, Solomon gives examples of the wise who act with integrity. Following Jesus’ wisdom also includes acting with integrity. <u>Fourth</u>, in four proverbs, Solomon gives examples of wise people who act with faith. Following Jesus’ wisdom also requires that your actions be rooted in your faith. <u>Fifth</u>, in three proverbs, Solomon gives examples where wise people act with obedience to God. Following Jesus’ wisdom should also include Spirit-led obedience. <u>Sixth</u>, in four proverbs, Solomon gives examples where wise people act according to Yahweh’s will. Following Jesus’ wisdom includes seeking to fulfill His will. <u>Finally</u>, in three proverbs, Solomon gives examples where wise people act as good stewards in family and other matters. Following Jesus’ wisdom should also include being a faithful steward with what He provides.</p>

Prov. 13:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A wise child submits to Spirit-led parental discipline</u>. In Biblical times, parents were Yahweh’s intended method for teaching His wisdom to the next generation of believers. Thus, a child was wise to accept his or her parent’s God-fearing discipline. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>A wise son accepts his father’s discipline, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke</em>.” (Prov. 13:1). “There is great hope of those that reverence their parents. There is little hope of any who will not hear those that deal faithfully with them.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 13:1).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Walk in Jesus’ wisdom by accepting Spirit-led discipline</u>. Honoring parental instruction is so important that it is the Fourth Commandment (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Solomon also repeatedly extolled the importance of submitting to God-fearing discipline. “My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD or loathe His rebuke,” (Prov. 3:11). “One who loves discipline loves knowledge, but one who hates rebuke is stupid.” (Prov. 12:1). “A fool rejects his father’s discipline, but he who complies with rebuke is sensible.” (Prov. 15:5). “One whose ear listens to a life-giving rebuke will stay among the wise. One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding.” (Prov. 15:31-32). “Listen to advice and accept discipline, so that you may be wise the rest of your days.” (Prov. 19:20). Jesus was without sin and did not need to be disciplined. But He submitted to the will of God the Father as our example.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The fruit of the Holy Spirit should be evident in God-honoring speech</u>. A person living according to Jesus’ wisdom produces the fruit of the Holy Spirit in his or her speech. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>From the fruit of a person’s mouth he enjoys good, but the desire of the treacherous is violence</em>.” (Prov. 13:2). “The Christian that is walking with God is using his tongue to bring honor unto God; therefore, inward comfort and satisfaction will daily fill his soul with refreshments. The soul of the transgressor plots mischief; he loves violence, but this will recoil in his face and bring ruin to his life.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 13:2).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The fruit of Spirit-led speech leads to Jesus’ blessing of contentment</u>. Those who refrain from evil words and instead use their words to serve Jesus will be blessed with His contentment. “A person will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his words, and the deeds of a person’s hands will return to him.” (Prov. 12:14). “With the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied; he will be satisfied with the product of his lips. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:20-21). “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit.” (Prov. 15:4). “Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.” (Prov. 16:24). Thus, believers should pray and be led by the Spirit to use their words to fulfill His will and speak words of life. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The fruit of Spirit-led speech includes restraint</u>. A believer who is led by the Spirit will also try to restrain from speaking evil words that may hurt others. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>One who guards his mouth protects his life; one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin</em>.” (Prov. 13:3). “The Bible says in <strong>Proverbs 13:3</strong> that guarding our mouths can preserve our life. The truth is that there is a time to remain silent and say nothing. When we are not in tune with God in our lives, we need to be careful to release words over our lives. We know that life and death are in the power of our words, or what we speak: <strong>Proverbs 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.</strong> The time to refrain from speaking and instead ‘guard our mouth’ is when we are overcome by negative emotions. Perhaps we have had a failure in life, lost our job, had a failed relationship, or something like this – in frustration; we may say things like, ‘This always happens to me.’ When we do that, we are essentially speaking words of death over our lives and bringing that into reality. Then, we will start to see that it always happens to us because we have spoken it into existence. Another time to guard our mouths is when speaking to other people. Not only can we speak death over other people, but we can potentially talk ourselves into, or out of trouble.” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 13:3).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Because the flesh is weak, pray and wait before responding in difficult situations</u>. When believers are hurt or offended, they should restrain their desire to immediately respond. Failing to do so may harm others. “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger, for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20). “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:21). “When there are many words, wrongdoing is unavoidable, but one who restrains his lips is wise.” (Prov. 10:19). “Do not be quick with your mouth or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.” (Ecc. 5:2).</p></li>

<p>Spirit-led speech includes restraining yourself from speaking evil words<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Spirit-led speech should encourage others to diligently serve Jesus</u>. Within the verses pertaining to speech, Solomon warned against people who are slothful and fail to contribute to Yahweh’s community. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous</em>.” (Prov. 13:4). “You will remember the apostle Paul put it right on the line to the Thessalonians. There were some pious souls there who said, ‘We’re looking for the Lord to come,’ and they quit work. Paul wrote, ‘…if any would not work, neither should he eat’ (2 Thess. 3:10). Let’s not be dolling out food to those who will not work. We are to work. And if you really believe that the Lord is coming, it will make you a better worker.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 13:4).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be an example to others by diligently laboring for Jesus</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned against the sin of slothfulness. “Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.” (Prov. 10:4-5). “The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor.” (Prov. 12:24). “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). “Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger.” (Prov. 19:15). “The lazy one does not plow after the autumn, so he begs during the harvest and has nothing.” (Prov. 20:4). “The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work;” (Prov. 21:25). “Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks.” (Ecc. 10:18). Jesus also warns against failing to use your spiritual gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30). “For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies. Now we command and exhort such persons in the Lord Jesus Christ to work peacefully and eat their own bread.” (2 Thess. 3:10-12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Spirit-led speech speaks only truth</u>. A believer living according to Jesus’ wisdom avoids lies, deceit, and speaks only truth out of love. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A righteous person hates a false statement, but a wicked person acts disgustingly and shamefully</em>.” (Prov. 13:5). “<strong>A righteous man hates lying</strong>: The <strong>righteous man</strong> or woman doesn’t just love truth and avoid the lie; they actually hate <strong>lying</strong>. Being godly, they have some of the love of the truth and hatred of the lie that God Himself has. <strong>A wicked man is loathsome</strong>: The implication is that <strong>wicked</strong> men and women love the lie, and this makes them <strong>loathsome</strong> and repulsive. This will surely bring them <strong>to shame</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 13:5).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>While those following Jesus’ wisdom speak truth, liars are in communion with Satan</u>. God “hates” lies: “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>There are six things that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hates, seven that are an abomination to Him: … <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>a false witness who declares lies,...” (Prov. 6:16-19). “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; … the perverted mouth, I hate.” (Prov. 8:13). Jesus is the truth (Jo. 14:6), and His truth sets you free (Jo. 8:32). Thus, you should only speak His truth out of love. “but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, that is, Christ,” (Eph. 4:15). In contrast, the wicked who lie put themselves in communion with Satan. “You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Jo. 8:44). “Behold, an evil person is pregnant with injustice, and he conceives harm and gives birth to lies. He has dug a pit and hollowed it out, and has fallen into the hole which he made.” (Ps. 7:14-15).</p></li>

<h2 id="integrity-believers-who-live-according-to-jesus-wisdom-act-with-integrity.-prov.-136-7."><strong>3. <u>Integrity: Believers Who Live According to Jesus’ Wisdom Act with Integrity.</u> Prov. 13:6-7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will guard believers who walk in His righteousness</u>. Another benefit to following the wisdom of Jesus’ righteousness is His promise of protection. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Righteousness guards the one whose way is blameless, but wickedness brings the sinner to ruin</em>.” (Prov. 13:6). “Men of uprightness and integrity, whose hearts are sincere in the ways of God; the principle of grace and righteousness in them keeps them in those ways, and will not suffer them to turn aside into crooked paths; the word of righteousness, the doctrine of the Gospel, is a means of preserving them from sin, and of keeping them in the right way; particularly the doctrine of Christ’s righteousness, and justification by it, is a great antidote against sin, and a powerful motive and incentive to the performance of good works, and all the duties of religion: it engages men to observe every command of Christ, to walk in all his ways; and is a great preservative from false doctrine and antichristian worship;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 13:6).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is a shield to those who walk in His righteous example</u>. Solomon promised that Yahweh is a shield to those with the faith to walk with integrity. “He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, guarding the paths of justice, and He watches over the way of His godly ones.” (Prov. 2:7-8). “The integrity of the upright will guide them, but the perversity of the treacherous will destroy them.” (Prov. 11:3). “Let integrity and uprightness protect me, for I wait for You.” (Ps. 25:21). “A Psalm of David. Vindicate me, LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.” (Ps. 26:1). “For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.” (Ps. 84:11). “Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD.” (Ps. 119:1). “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than a person who is perverse in speech and is a fool.” (Prov. 19:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers with the wisdom to walk in Jesus’ righteousness are modest</u>. As our example, Jesus lived a modest life. He emptied Himself of heavenly glory to become a servant (Phil. 2:7). “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>There is one who pretends to be rich but has nothing; another pretends to be poor, but has great wealth</em>.” (Prov. 13:7). “Two singularly-contrasted characters are set in opposition here. One, that of a man who lives like a millionaire and is a pauper; another, that of a man who lives like a pauper and is rich. The latter character, that of a man who hides and hoards his wealth, was, perhaps, more common in the days when this collection of Proverbs was put together, because in all ill-governed countries, to show wealth is a short way to get rid of it … Whatever a man may think about himself, however he may estimate himself and conceit himself, there stand out two salient facts, the fact of universal dependence, and the fact of universal sinfulness, which ought to bear into every heart the consciousness of this poverty.” Those who instead trust in Jesus “will be of those blessed poor ones who are ‘rich through faith, and heirs of the Kingdom.”’ (Alexander MacLaren’s Expositions on the Bible, Prov. 13:7).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A believer living according to Jesus’ wisdom stores up their treasures in heaven</u>. Jesus warned that those who spend their lives in pursuit of worldly treasures instead of turning to Him as their savior will have nothing to pay the ransom for their sins. “For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26; Mk. 8:36-37; Lk. 9:25). “But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have counted as loss because of Christ. More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them mere rubbish, so that I may gain Christ,” (Phil. 3:7-8). “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Better is one who is lightly esteemed and has a servant, than one who honors himself and lacks bread.” (Prov. 12:9). “Better is a little with righteousness than great income with injustice.” (Prov. 16:8).</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-believers-who-live-according-to-jesus-wisdom-have-their-actions-rooted-in-their-faith.-prov.-138-12."><strong>4. <u>Faith: Believers Who Live According to Jesus’ Wisdom Have Their Actions Rooted in Their Faith</u>. Prov. 13:8-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Have faith in Jesus to be the ransom for your soul</u>. Those who place their worth in Jesus instead of worldly wealth will be spared from His judgment. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The ransom of a person’s life is his wealth, but the poor hears no rebuke</em>.” (Prov. 13:8). “On the one side is the seeming advantage of wealth. The rich man who gets out of many troubles often escapes from a just retribution by his money. But then the poor man in his turn is free from the risk of the threats and litigation that beset the rich. He ‘hears no rebuke’ (the words are not used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm"><u>Proverbs 13:1</u></a>) just as the dead ‘hear not the voice of the oppressor’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm"><u>Job 3:18</u></a> or the abuse of the envious.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 13:8).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-13/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.26339in;height:1.97034in" alt="His Word is Truth: Advent Day 20: Jesus Came to Give His Life as a Ransom" /></p>
<p>Faith in Jesus offers the only way to ransom your soul<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Worldly wealth cannot ransom a person’s soul</u>. The foolish will one day learn that their worldly wealth will be meaningless when they die. “Riches do not benefit on the day of wrath, but righteousness rescues from death.” (Prov, 11:4). Thus, Jesus came to give His life as a ransom. “just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.” (Matt. 20:28; Mk. 10:45). Through His ransom, believers can become righteous. “and He Himself brought our sins in His body up on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness; by His wounds you were healed.” (1 Pet. 2:24). Thus, believers should focus their hearts on the treasure of righteousness through Jesus over worldly wealth, which cannot save you. “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21). “Jesus said to him, ‘If you want to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”’ (Matt. 19:21; Lk. 18:22). “Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.” (1 Tim. 6:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith in Jesus’ light</u>. The light of Jesus offers an eternal source of joy. In contrast, those who put their trust in other things will one day live in eternal darkness. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked goes out</em>.” (Prov. 13:9). “This proverb contrasts the enduring wealth of the righteous with the extinction of the wicked by comparing the former’s shining lamp with the latter’s snuffed-out lamp. <em>The light</em> that <em>shines brightly</em> symbolizes legitimate wealth and well-being, including long life (24:20; 2 Sam. 21:17; Job 18:5-6; 21:17; 22:28; Lam. 3:2; Amos 5:18, 20). The contrast in the verset points to the ensuring life and prosperity of <em>righteous people</em> versus the transitory light, and by implication the fading wealth, of <em>wicked people</em>. <em>Snuffed out</em> (deliberately extinguished) symbolizes the final misfortune and hopelessness of the wicked (see 24:20; cf. 20:20; Job 18:5-6). The divine passive implies <em>I AM</em> is the agent who gives and takes life.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 13:9).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith in Jesus’ light to guide you</u>. While the enemy can appear as a false angel of light, Jesus is the one true source of light that you can trust to guide you. “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.” (Matt. 5:14-15). “so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,” (Phil. 2:15). “for you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light” (Eph. 5:8). “If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.” (1 Jo. 1:6-7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith to humbly accept Jesus’ direction</u>. While the proud rely upon themselves, such self-reliance is ultimately foolish. Believers should instead look for Jesus’ wisdom through the Word, prayer, and counsel. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Through overconfidence comes nothing but strife, but wisdom is with those who receive counsel</em>.” (Prov. 13:10). “Proverbs provides lessons on how to live a righteous and fulfilling life. Understanding this verse requires us to appreciate the overarching themes found throughout the book. Wisdom is not just about intelligence; it’s also about building relationships, listening, and understanding. In a world that often celebrates self-sufficiency and independence, this passage reminds us of the value of community and collaboration.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 13:10).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Have the humility to recognize that you need Jesus’ guidance</u>. Jesus will reward wisdom to those with the humility to recognize that true wisdom comes from Him. “When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom.” (Prov. 11:2). “A person’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). “But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic … But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, free of hypocrisy.” (Jam. 3:14-15, 17; Phil. 2:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have the faith use your talents to labor for Jesus</u>. Those who spend their lives in pursuit of worldly wealth will find that it will one day disappear. In contrast, those who labor for Jesus will find that their eternal treasures will last forever. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>Wealth obtained from nothing dwindles, but one who gathers by labor increases it</em>.” (Prov. 13:11). “In Proverbs 13:11, we are reminded that wealth acquired hastily tends to diminish, while diligent accumulation leads to increase. This verse underscores the value of hard work and patience in financial matters, contrasting quick gains with steady growth. In a world fixated on instant success, this wisdom prompts us to appreciate the rewards of perseverance and gradual progress.” (Godsbless.ing on Prov. 13:11).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your faith in Jesus should include careful planning and hard work</u>. Jesus wants you to pray and carefully plan how best to labor for Him. “For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?” (Lk. 14:28). When you trust in His plans and labor diligently for Him, He will reward you. “Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.” (Gal. 6:9). “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21; Lk. 12:33-34). “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.” (1 Tim. 6:9-11).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who have faith have an eternal hope of life that cannot be taken away</u>. Those who put their hope in worldly things will ultimately be disappointed. In contrast, those who put their hope in Jesus’ eternal promises will have their desires fulfilled. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but desire fulfilled is a tree of life</em>.” (Prov. 13:12). God does not want you to covet or desire carnal things. Thus, this verse “may be applied also to the spiritual presence of Christ, and communion with him; this is what believers, being sometimes without, hope and wait for; and sometimes it is deferred a long time, at least they think it so, which makes them very uneasy, and even sick of love, as the church was, Sol 5:8; but when what they so earnestly desire is granted them, it is as if they were in Eden's garden, or rather in the paradise above, plucking the fruit of the tree of life: likewise it may be applied to eternal glory and happiness; this is the object of hope in the present state; it is sometimes impatiently expected and desired, and the language of the soul is, "Why is his chariot so long in coming?", "come, Lord Jesus, come quickly’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm"><u>Judges 5:28</u></a>; and when this desired happiness is enjoyed, how sweet will it be! and the sweeter for having been so much longed and wished for; and when the saints will be in the paradise of God, and eat of the tree of life in the midst of it, and never hunger more.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 13:12).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>Those with the faith to put their hope in Jesus will find their strength renewed</u>.  When you put your hope in Jesus and wait for Him, He will strengthen you when you feel weary.  “Yet those who wait for the LORD will gain new strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary.”  (Is. 40:31).  “Why are you in despair, my soul?  And why are you restless within me?  Wait for God, for I will again praise Him for the help of His presence, my God.”  (Ps. 42:5).  “My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for Your word.”  (Ps. 119:81).  “The LORD is good to those who await Him, to the person who seeks Him.  It is good that he waits silently for the salvation of the LORD.”  (Lam. 3:25-26).  “For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?  But if we hope for what we do not see, through perseverance we wait eagerly for it.”  (Rom. 8:24-25).  “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,”  (Heb. 6:19).  “in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,”  (Titus 1:2).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Obedience to Jesus’ Word should be the fruit of your faith</u>. Those with the faith to obey Jesus’ Word will be rewarded. In contrast, those who reject His Word face judgment. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>One who despises the word will do badly, but one who fears the commandment will be rewarded</em>.” (Prov. 13:13). “<strong>He who despises the word will be destroyed</strong>: This principle may be fulfilled through the direct judgment of God upon those who commit the terrible sin of despising His <strong>word</strong>, or by the natural consequences of such folly. <strong>He who fears the commandment will be rewarded</strong>: The one who not only understands and obeys but also properly respects and reverences God’s word (<strong>fears the commandment</strong>) will <strong>be rewarded</strong> both in this life and the life to come.” (David Guzik on Prov. 13:13).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus will reward those with the faith to obey His Word<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who put Jesus’ Word into practice in their lives will be protected during a trial</u>. If you have the faith to obey Jesus’ Word, it will anchor you when you face life’s inevitable tribulations. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:24-27; Lk. 6:47-49). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves.” (Jam. 1:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience also leads to the blessing of eternal life</u>. True faith produces the fruit of obedience. If not, it is dead (Jam. 2:14-26). This fruit is also evidence of the eternal life that Jesus offers believers. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, to turn aside from the snares of death</em>.” (Prov. 13:14). “[T]he doctrine of those who are taught by the word, and are wise unto salvation; the words or doctrines of the wise, which are given forth by one Shepherd; the instructions of such who are like Scribes, well instructed themselves unto the kingdom of heaven: these are as a fountain of living water; which are the means of quickening dead sinners, and of reviving and refreshing the souls of weary saints; and bring life and immortality to light, and point and lead to eternal life: and so direct souls to depart from the snares of death; the snares of sin, Satan, and the world, to shun and avoid them; with which men being entangled, are brought to destruction and death.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 13:14).<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus by humbly following His Word</u>. Faith-led obedience also leads to Jesus’ fountain of life. “The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, by which one may avoid the snares of death.” (Prov. 14:27). “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and rebukes for discipline are the way of life” (Prov. 6:23). “The Law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.” (Ps. 19:7). “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path … The unfolding of Your words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple.” (Ps. 119:105, 130). “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faithfully following also produces His Jesus’ favor</u>. If you have the faith to follow Jesus’ wisdom, you will also gain His favor on Earth. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>Good understanding produces favor, but the way of the treacherous is their own disaster</em>.” (Prov. 13:15). “Proverbs 13:15 emphasizes the significance of wisdom and understanding in leading a fulfilling life. It reminds us that the choices we make today shape our future. We encourage ourselves to seek knowledge, be aware of our decisions, and surround ourselves with wise influences. The blessings of understanding are profound, leading us toward a life filled with favor and grace.” (Christinanitypath.com on Prov. 13:15).<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>To find Jesus’ favor, obey His Word</u>. The wisdom that produces Jesus’ favor comes from His Word and not from worldly knowledge. “For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “The beginning of wisdom is: acquire wisdom; and with all your possessions, acquire understanding.” (Prov. 4:7). “I love those who love me; and those who diligently seek me will find me.” (Prov. 8:17). “The mind of the discerning acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.” (Prov. 18:15). “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8; Lk. 11:9-10; Mk. 11:24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have the humility to recognize that you must search out Jesus’ wisdom</u>. While fools believe that they have all the answers, wise people recognize that they must turn to Jesus to find true knowledge. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>Every prudent person acts with knowledge, but a fool displays foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 13:16). “It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 13:16).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Restrain yourself when you think you have the answers and read the Word and pray</u>. Solomon repeatedly warned about the dangers of speaking too quickly. “The tongue of the wise makes knowledge pleasant, but the mouth of fools spouts foolishness.” (Prov. 15:2). “Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, and one who hurries his footsteps errs.” (Prov. 19:2). When you seek to serve Jesus, you must carefully prepare (Lk. 14:28-33). This includes reading the Word, prayer, and listening to godly counsel.</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-will-people-who-live-according-to-jesus-wisdom-seek-to-follow-jesus-will.-prov.-1317-21."><strong>6. <u>Jesus’ Will: People Who Live According to Jesus’ Wisdom Seek to Follow Jesus’ Will</u>. Prov. 13:17-21.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Believers who follow Jesus’ wisdom act as His messenger</u>.  Jesus’ wisdom is not meant to be hoarded.  Instead, if you seek to live according to Jesus’ wisdom, you will use His wisdom to help others in need.  “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>A wicked messenger falls into adversity, but a faithful messenger brings healing</em>.”  (Prov. 13:17).  “The character of a man can be determined by the message that he delivers.  A man that leans toward the wickedness of this world will speak about those things, and will find that he will be led into mischief by them.  Just as the wicked man is known by pure speech, faithfulness marks the true ambassador (1 Cor. 4:1-2).  He will not shun to declare the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:27).  In his word will be found health for the needy.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 13:17).<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Through the Spirit, Jesus gives you the power to be His messenger</u>. Jesus commissioned every believer to be His messenger. “but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and as far as the remotest part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8). Being His messenger means that your speech should be filled with His love and grace. “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6). “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29). “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.” (Jam. 3:13-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To follow Jesus’ will, you must also submit to His correction</u>. If you are willing to submit to Jesus’ correction, you will stay on His path. He will in turn bless you if you honor His will for you. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>Poverty and shame will come to one who neglects discipline, but one who complies with rebuke will be honored</em>.” (Prov. 13:18). “This proverb … matches v.13… Both connect reward to being correctible and punishment to being incorrigible (see 3:16; 8:18). <em>The person who ignores</em> corrective <em>instruction meets with poverty and disgrace</em>, a hendiadys denoting shameful poverty. By contrast, <em>the one who heeds correction will be honored</em>. The imprecise parallelism suggests that honor entails the wealth that gives one social gravitas (cf. 3:9; 4:8; 8:18). The causes of poverty are many: laziness (cf. 10:4-5; 12:24), bloviating instead of working (14:23), pursuing pleasure (21:17; 28:19). But here, a more fundamental problem is in view – namely, disobeying the instruction that will correct these faults. Paradoxically, those who flout formative discipline are disciplined by depletion and disgrace, but those who submit to discipline are honored.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 13:18).<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ correction will keep you on His narrow path</u>. To follow Jesus’ will for your life, you must humbly submit to His instruction and correction. “One who is on the path of life follows instruction, but one who ignores a rebuke goes astray.” (Prov. 10:17). “One who neglects discipline rejects himself, but one who listens to a rebuke acquires understanding.” (Prov. 15:32). “Listen to advice and accept discipline, so that you may be wise the rest of your days.” (Prov. 19:20). “A person often rebuked who becomes obstinate will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.” (Prov. 29:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>If you follow Jesus’ will, He will reward your desires</u>. Although worldly desires will fade and disappoint, Jesus will fulfill your desires when you want what He wants for you. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>Desire realized is sweet to the soul, but it is an abomination to fools to turn away from evil</em>.” (Prov. 13:19). “Proverbs 13:19 is not merely about personal gain; it is a call to reflect on our motives. By aligning our dreams with wisdom and righteousness, we find true fulfillment, turning the sweetness of achieved desires into a spiritual gift that nourishes our souls.” (Christianitypath.com, Prov. 13:19).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Turn to Jesus to keep your desires focused on His will</u>. Both David and Solomon promised that God will fulfill the desires of those who want what He wants. “Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4). “What the wicked fears will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted.” (Prov. 10:24). To keep your desires focused on Jesus’ will, you must pray and let the Spirit guide you. “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, in order to keep you from doing whatever you want.” (Gal. 5:16-17). This also includes abstaining from the desires of the flesh. “for if you are living in accord with the flesh, you are going to die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.” (Ro. 8:13). “Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts, which wage war against the soul.” (1 Pet. 2:11). “Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:15). This also includes praying for the Holy Spirit to renew your mind every day. “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Ro. 12:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Following Jesus’ will includes fellowship with believers</u>. The enemy attacks believers who are separated from Jesus’ flock. Thus, the wise will surround themselves with other faithful believers. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>One who walks with wise people will be wise, but a companion of fools will suffer harm</em>.” (Prov. 13:20). “Choosing friends wisely is a critical theme found throughout the book of Proverbs, highlighting the significant influence of companionship on an individual's moral and intellectual growth. Engaging with wise individuals fosters wisdom, as their knowledge and experiences serve as a guiding light. Conversely, associating with foolish people can lead one to danger and destruction, illustrating the stark consequences of poor associations. This principle emphasizes the importance of discernment in relationships to ensure personal growth and integrity. In this context, the proverb states that those who walk with the wise will become wise, while companions of fools will face ruin.” (Thebiblesays.com on Prov. 13:20).<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>

<p>To stay rooted in Jesus’ will, surround yourself with faithful believers<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Surround yourself with believers, and they will help you to follow Jesus’ will</u>.  A faithful believer helps to guide others.  “The righteous person is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.”  (Prov. 12:26).  Faithful believers will also help you to grow in your walk.  “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.” (Prov. 27:17).  In contrast, when you surround yourself with people trapped in sin, you can be pulled off your walk.  “Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers!”  (Ps. 1:1). “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.”’  (1 Cor. 15:33).  “Do not be mismatched with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness share together, or what does light have in common with darkness?”  (2 Cor. 6:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Following Jesus’ will includes trusting in His provision</u>. Jesus will also reward you by providing for you if you follow His will. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>Adversity pursues sinners, but the righteous will be rewarded with prosperity</em>.” (Prov. 13:21). “Sinners suffer not only the natural consequences of crime in external evil, injury to body, estate, reputation, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm"><u>Psalm 11:6</u></a>), but also stings of conscience and remorse; even seeming prosperity is often a chastisement, and long impunity is only augmenting the coming retribution. As the shadow attends the substance, so guilt is attached to sin, and brings with it punishment … ‘The righteous shall be recompensed with good.’ They shall have the answer of a good conscience, happiness here and hereafter.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 13:21).<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those with the wisdom to follow Jesus’ path of righteousness will reap what they sow</u>. Jesus knows what is best for you. If you trust His perfect will and follow His narrow path, He promises to bless you. “For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” (Ps. 1:6). “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.” (Gal. 6:7-9). “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Believers should be good stewards by providing for their God-given families</u>. Children are a gift from Jesus (Ps. 127:3; Jam. 1:17). Thus, to follow Jesus’ wisdom, believers should seek to provide a legacy for them. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>A good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren, and the wealth of a sinner is stored up for the righteous</em>.” (Prov. 13:22). “A good man’s estate will last. He is careful, both by justice and charity, to obtain the blessing of God upon what he has, and to give those blessings unto his children. If he should not leave them much of this world’s goods, his prayers, instructions, and example will be the best gift he could leave them. The good man’s inheritance is also increased from the wealth of the sinner. Laban’s wealth was laid up for Jacob (Gen. 31:1, 9, 16); the spoils of Egypt and Canaan for Israel (Joshua 11:14), and Abraham (Gen. 14:16). This verse shall be more clearly understood in the millennial reign of Christ, when His people will have control of all things.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 13:22).<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your first ministry should be to your family</u>. Jesus wants you to help others. But you must also ensure that your children have their provision through Him. “But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.” (1 Tim. 5:8). “shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not with greed but with eagerness;” (1 Pet. 5:2). “Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.” (2 Cor. 12:14). “I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his descendants begging for bread. All day long he is gracious and lends, and his descendants are a blessing.” (Ps. 37:25-26).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>A faithful believer is also a good steward with God’s resources</u>. There is injustice in this fallen word. But even though evil people may cause you harm, Jesus still provides abundant resources if you labor diligently with what He provides. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Abundant food is in the uncultivated ground of the poor, but it is swept away by injustice</em>.” (Prov. 13:23). “This saying qualifies v. 21 by teaching that <em>I AM</em> – though he is not named here – ensures the earth has abundant food for the hardworking poor, but sometimes tyrants sweep it or them away through injustice … The proverb here assumes the poor work hard and collect <em>plenty of food</em>. The problem is not God’s creation or poor working habits but injustice… This proverb corrects simplistic understandings of the principle of retribution asserted in other proverbs. Injustice exists, and retribution may be delayed to a future beyond death.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 13:23).<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who oppress the poor</u>. When evil overcomes believers, believers should turn to Jesus. He promises to judge those who oppress the poor. “One who oppresses the poor to make more for himself, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.” (Prov. 22:16). “Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness, and his upstairs rooms without justice, who uses his neighbor’s services without pay and does not give him his wages,” (Jer. 22:13). “Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of armies.” (Jam. 5:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers should steward children with godly discipline</u>. Proverbs 13 begins with a plea for children to listen to godly correction. Here, Solomon returns with a plea for parents to be faithful stewards by disciplining their children. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>He who withholds his rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently</em>.” (Prov. 13:24). “He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 13:24).<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers should only discipline children out of love</u>. A loving parent should discipline children the way that God disciplines believers. “So you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5). “Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.” (Rev. 3:19). “Discipline your son while there is hope, and do not desire his death.” (Prov. 19:18). “Do not withhold discipline from a child; though you strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod and rescue his soul from Sheol.” (Prov. 23:13-14). “Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he grows older he will not abandon it.” (Prov. 22:6). But discipline should only be done out of love and not out of anger. “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Eph 6:4). “Fathers, do not antagonize your children, so that they will not become discouraged.” (Col. 3:21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be content with what Jesus gives you to steward</u>. Proverbs 13 concludes with a reminder to be content with what Jesus provides. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the stomach of the wicked is in need</em>.” (Prov. 13:25). “He is blessed with a sufficient competency to live upon; and he is contented with what he has, and uses it moderately; … and so as to spiritual things; he eats to the satisfying of his soul, with the goodness and fatness of God’s house, with the word and ordinances, with the promises of the Gospel, and with Jesus Christ, the bread of life; with these he is satisfied, as with marrow and fatness;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 13:25).<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ righteousness and will, you will be satisfied</u>. Jesus wants you to work hard as a faithful steward. If you trust that He provides what you were meant to have, you will always be satisfied. “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.” (Matt. 5:6). “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31). “Jesus said to them, ‘I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty.”’ (Jo. 6:35). “The LORD is my shepherd, I will not be in need.” (Ps. 23:1). “The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:10). “For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.” (Ps. 84:11). “For He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and He has filled the hungry soul with what is good.” (Ps. 107:9). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:19).</p></li>
