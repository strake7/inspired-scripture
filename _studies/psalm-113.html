<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalms 113 through 118 comprise what the Jews called the “Hallel” (<span dir="rtl">הַלֵּל</span>) or “Praise.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although the exodus is not referenced until Psalm 114, the six psalms celebrate God’s Passover deliverance. The Passover foreshadowed when Jesus, the lamb of God, was sacrificed to allow death to “pass over” His believers (Jo. 1:29). Thus, these six psalms foreshadow Jesus. During the Last Supper (a Seder), Jesus most likely led His disciples in singing Psalms 113 and 114 as a praise for what He was about to do at the cross: “The Jews sang the first two psalms before the Passover meal and the other four afterwards. So these were probably the songs that Jesus and the apostles sang in the upper room on the night that He was betrayed (Matt. 25:30).” (Steven J. Cole on Ps. 113).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Through the psalmist's praises, the Bible reveals seven things about Jesus that are worthy of your praise. These include His: (1) holy name, (2) eternal faithfulness, (3) sovereignty, (4) omnipotence, (5) deliverance, (6) grace, and (7) offer of new life.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist urged God’s servants to “<em>praise the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” His name represents His holy, divine character. As part of the Triune God, Jesus offers to share His glory with you. Thus, He is worthy of your service, praise, and worship. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist declared, “<em>Blessed be the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from this time on and forever</em>.” Jesus deserves and will receive eternal praise because He is faithful for all eternity. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist proclaimed, “<em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens</em>.” You can praise Jesus because He is the sovereign King of Kings and ruler over all powers. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist expressed in awe, “<em>Who is like the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God?</em>” Jesus is all-powerful. But He is not a remote and distant divine being. He loves us and uses His power for good to deliver us. <u>Fifth</u>, quoting from the song of Hannah, the psalmist declared: “<em>He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the garbage heap</em>.” Jesus also deserves your praise for delivering you from your suffering. <u>Sixth</u>, in addition to rescuing His people, God seats His people “<em>with noblemen, with the noblemen of His people</em>.” Jesus also deserves your praise for the honors He will give you now and in heaven out of grace. <u>Finally</u>, again quoting from the song of Hannah, the psalmist marveled, “<em>He has the infertile woman live in the house as a joyful mother of children</em>.” We were once dead because of our sins, like an infertile womb. But Jesus offers you a new life. Again, He is worthy of praise.</p>
<h2 id="his-glorious-name-praise-jesus-for-his-holy-divine-character.-ps.-1131."><strong>1.  <u>His Glorious Name: Praise Jesus for His Holy, Divine Character</u>. Ps. 113:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist praised God’s holy name</u>. The psalmist commanded all God’s servants, both Jews and gentiles, to praise His holy name:  “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Praise Him, you servants of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, praise the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Ps. 113:1). In English, a name is merely a means for identification. In contrast, praising God’s “name” is to praise His character: “praise the name of the Lord; not any particular name, as Jehovah; but him himself, and the perfections of his nature; his holiness, justice, truth, faithfulness, power, goodness, grace and mercy.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 113:1).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God’s Holy name</u>. The Jews praised God for His holy name: “<em>bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God forever and ever! May Your glorious name be blessed and exalted above all blessing and praise!</em>” (Neh. 9:5). “Ascribe to the Lord <em>the glory due to His name</em>; worship the Lord in holy array.”  (Ps. 29:2).  “O magnify the Lord with me, and <em>let us exalt His name together</em>.”  (Ps. 34:3). “<em><sup>2 </sup>sing the glory of His name;</em> make His praise glorious.<em>”</em> (Ps. 66:2).  “Sing to God, <em>sing praises to His name</em>; lift up a song for Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the Lord, and exult before Him.”  (Ps. 68:4).  “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19).  “All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and <em>they shall glorify Your name</em>.”  (Ps. 86:9).  “God is known in Judah; <em>His name is great</em> in Israel.” (Ps. 76:1).  “Ascribe to the LORD <em>the glory of His name</em>; bring an offering and come into His courts.” (Ps. 96:8). “Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but <em>to Your name give glory</em> because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.” (Ps. 115:1). “Praise the LORD! <em>Praise the name of the LORD</em>; praise Him, you servants of the LORD,” (Ps. 135:1). “Ascribe to the Lord <em>the glory due His name</em>; bring an offering, and come before Him; worship the Lord in holy array.”  (1 Ch. 16:29). Daniel also praised God’s holy name: “Daniel said, ‘<em>May the name of God be blessed forever and ever</em>, for wisdom and power belong to Him.”’ (Dan. 2:20). David also praised God’s holy name: “that <em>Your name may be magnified forever</em>,” (2 Sam. 7:26). Do your prayers also include praises for God’s holy name?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Glorify Jesus’ Holy name</u>.  Jesus instructs believers to give glory to God’s name:  “Pray, then, in this way: ‘Our Father who is in heaven, <em>hallowed be Your name</em> . . .”  (Matt. 6:9).  God is worthy of your complete devotion and loving admiration.  One day all creation will bow down and also praise Jesus’ holy name: “so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,” (Phil. 2:10). “And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.’” (Rev. 5:13). Give glory to Jesus because He is holy, loving, merciful, and just.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has given all believers the power to pray in His name</u>. In the Old Testament, believers also evoked God’s “name” to reference His complete abilities and character. For example, Abraham called upon the “name of the Lord” in reference to His full power (Gen. 12:8; 13:4). As another example, God proclaimed His “name” to Moses in reference to His power (Ex. 33:19; 34:5). It was also an act of worship when someone called upon “the name” of the Lord (Gen. 21:33; 26:25). Likewise, belief in the <em>name</em> of Jesus Christ alone brings salvation (Jo. 1:12). Believers are also commanded to gather in Jesus’ <em>name</em> (Matt. 18:20). We are to “make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them <em>in the name</em> of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 28:19). In the book of Acts, the early disciples also frequently referred to their service, worship, and suffering as being done in Jesus Christ’s “<em>name</em>.” (e.g, Acts 4:18; 5:28, 41; 10:43; 19:17). The name of Jesus will, however, be a stumbling block to non-believers. Jesus warns that those who bear His name will be hated (Matt. 10:22). Yet, for those believers who pray in faith, Jesus has given you the legal equivalent of a power of attorney to pray in His <em>name</em> when you seek to do His will: “Whatever you <em>ask in My name, that will I do,</em> so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <em>If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it</em>.” (Jo. 14:13-14). “You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that <em>whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you</em>.” (Jo. 15:16). “In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, <em>if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you</em>.” (Jo. 16:23). Jesus’ name is so powerful that the archangel Michael was able to drive Satan away merely by rebuking him in Jesus’ name (Jude 1:9). But to correctly pray “in Jesus’ name”, pray for His will to be done and not yours.</p></li>

<h2 id="faithfulness-praise-jesus-because-he-is-faithful-for-all-eternity.-ps.-1132."><strong>2. <u>Faithfulness</u></strong><u>: <strong>Praise Jesus Because He is Faithful for All Eternity</strong></u><strong>. Ps. 113:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s holy name will be praised for all eternity</u>. The psalmist commanded God’s servants to praise His holy name at all times and for all eternity:  “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Blessed be the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from this time on and forever. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is to be praised</em>.” (Ps. 113:3). “<strong>From this time forth and forevermore</strong>: In <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+113.1&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 113:1</a> we were encouraged to praise the name of Yahweh. In this next verse we are encouraged to do it <strong>forevermore</strong>. The unchanging God never becomes unworthy of our praise. For the child of God with open eyes, time only reveals more reasons to praise Him . . . <strong>From the rising of the sun to its going down</strong>: Using the Hebrew pattern of repetition, the psalmist emphasized the idea that God’s is worthy of <em>continual</em> praise.” (David Guzik on Ps. 113:2-3) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>At all times, praise Jesus’ holy name<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s name will be exalted for all eternity in heaven</u>. Other psalms also declare the eternal prayer that God will receive in heaven. “But as for us, <em>we will bless the LORD from this time and forever</em>. Praise the LORD!” (Ps. 115:18). “A Psalm of Praise, of David. I will exalt You, my God, the King, and <em>I will bless Your name forever and ever</em>. Every day I will bless You, and <em>I will praise Your name forever and ever</em> . . . My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, and <em>all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever</em>.” (Ps. 145:1-2, 21). In heaven, the praise for God will continue for all eternity.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God has and will continue to reign supreme forever</u>. Throughout the Bible, God is revealed to have existed forever. Moses called Yahweh “<em>the Everlasting God</em>.” (Gen. 21:33). God will also reign forever: “The <em>LORD shall reign forever and ever</em>.” (Ex. 15:18). “<em>The LORD is King forever and ever;</em> nations have perished from His land.” (Ps. 10:16). “The LORD sat <em>as King</em> at the flood; yes, <em>the LORD sits as King forever</em>.” (Ps. 29:10). “Your throne, God, is <em>forever and ever</em>; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.” (Ps. 45:6). “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity</em>.” (Ps. 93:2). “But You are the same, and <em>Your years will not come to an end</em>.” (Ps. 102:27). “<em>Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom</em>, and Your dominion endures throughout all generations. The LORD is faithful in His words, and holy in all His works.” (Ps. 145:13). “I issue a decree that in all the realm of my kingdom people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for <em>He is the living God and enduring forever</em>, and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, and <em>His dominion will be forever</em>.” (Dan. 6:26). “<em>You, LORD, rule forever</em>; Your throne is from generation to generation.” (Lam. 5:19). “Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; <em>the number of His years is unsearchable</em>.” (Job 36:26). “Now to <em>the King eternal, immortal</em>, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.” (1 Tim. 1:17). “<em>He is before all things</em>, and in Him all things hold together.” (Col. 1:17). “But regarding the Son He says, ‘Your throne, God, is <em>forever and ever</em>, and ever, and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of His Kingdom.” (Heb. 1:8). Thus, God never changes.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is also faithful for all eternity</u>. Jesus’ faithfulness will also last for all eternity. He never changes: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever.” (Heb. 13:8). “to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever. Amen.” (Jude 1:25). Thus, you can trust Jesus to be faithful and always keep His promises to you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t put your trust in the fleeting things of this world</u>. In contrast to Jesus’ eternal nature, the things of the world will quickly pass, like grass (Ps. 90:5-6; Is. 40:7; 1 Pet. 1:24; Ps. 37:2; Ps. 92:7; Ja. 1:11). Thus, put your trust in Jesus and not in worldly things: “and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the present form of this world is passing away.” (1 Cor. 7:31). Money and success cannot save you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing praises to Jesus on a regular basis</u>. The psalms also remind believers to make praise and worship a regular part of your walk with Jesus, not just when you attend church: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, Sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.” (Ps. 7:17). “I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Be exalted, LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.” (Ps. 21:13). “A Psalm. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth; sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:1-2). “Sing to God, sing praises to His name; exalt Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the LORD, and be jubilant before Him.” (Ps. 68:4). “A Psalm of Asaph. Sing for joy to God our strength; shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.” (Ps. 81:1). “Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth; be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.” (Ps. 98:4). “Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.” (Ps. 135:3). Are you regularly praising Jesus for allowing death to pass over you?</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereignty-praise-jesus-as-the-king-of-kings-over-all-creation.-ps.-1134."><strong>3. <u>Sovereignty: Praise Jesus as the King of Kings Over All Creation</u>. Ps. 113:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God has full power and dominion over everything</u>. No force on Earth or in heaven can challenge’s God’s sovereign authority: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens</em>.” (Ps. 113:4). “<em>The Lord is high above all nations </em>— Superior to all princes and bodies of people in the world; <em>and his glory above the heavens — </em> Whereas the glory of earthly monarchs is confined to this lower world, and to small pittances of it, the glory of God doth not only fill the earth, but heaven too, where it is celebrated by thousands and myriads of blessed angels; yea, it is far higher than heaven, being infinite and incomprehensible,” (Joseph Benson Commentary on Ps. 113:4-6).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-113/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.02407in;height:2.35889in" alt="Verse of the Day - Psalm 113:4 - iDisciple" /></p>
<p>Praise Jesus as the King of Kings over all creation<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Every nation and person is subject to God’s authority</u>.  The psalmist declared that: “<strong><sup> </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is high above all nations; . .</em> .” (Ps. 113:4). David declared that God’s authority extends over not just the Earth, but also “those who live in it.”  (Ps.  24:1). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.”  (Ps. 10:16).  “But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.” (Ps. 75:7). “The LORD makes poor and rich; He humbles, He also exalts.” (1 Sam. 2:7). Daniel later explained:  “It is He [God] who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.”  (Da. 2:21).  “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.”  (Job 12:23).  “Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.”  (Is. 40:15).  “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.”  (Is. 40:17).  “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; . . .”  (Is. 9:3(a)).  “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’”  (Dan. 4:35).  Even when evil surrounds you or when you are ruled by evil leaders, do you trust that God is still in ultimate control?     </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has full authority over the nations</u>.  Jesus will reign with full authority over the nations:  “Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”  (Rev. 11:15).  “The one who overcomes, and the one who keeps My deeds until the end, I will give him authority over the nations;” (Rev. 2:26). God the Father has further given Jesus full authority to judge evil:  “For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.”  (Jo. 5:22). Thus, you never need to fear evil powers. Jesus has full authority over all creation.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God for His majestic glory</u>. The psalmist declared that “<em>His glory is above the heavens</em>.” (Ps. 113:4). Even the heavens cannot contain His glory: “But will God really dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, <em>heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You</em>; how much less this house which I have built!” (2 Chr. 6:18). As our example, David and other men of God also worshiped God for His majesty, glory, and strength: “A Psalm of David. LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth, <em>You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!</em>” (Ps. 8:1). “A Psalm of David. <em>The heavens tell of the glory of God</em>; and their expanse declares the work of His hands.” (Ps. 19:1). “One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek:  That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, <em>to behold the beauty of the LORD and to meditate in His temple</em>.”  (Ps. 27:4). “A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, sons of the mighty, <em>ascribe to the LORD glory and strength</em>. . . “The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare; and in His temple everything says, “<em>Glory</em>!”  (Ps. 29:1, 9). “Be exalted above the heavens, God; <em>may Your glory be above all the earth</em>.” (Ps. 57:5). “Splendor and <em>majesty are before Him</em>, strength and joy are in His place. Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples, <em>ascribe to the LORD glory and strength</em>. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come before Him; . . .” (1 Chr. 16:27-29a). “Ascribe strength to God; <em>His majesty is over Israel</em>, and His strength is in the skies.” (Ps. 68:34). “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and <em>may the whole earth be filled with His glory</em>. Amen and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19). “The heavens declare His righteousness, and <em>all the peoples have seen His glory</em>.”  (Ps. 97:6). “Be exalted above the heavens, God, and <em>may Your glory be above all the earth</em>.” (Ps. 108:5). “however, as I live, <em>all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD</em>.” (Nu. 14:21). “ . . . <em>The whole earth is full of His glory</em>.”’ (Is. 6:3). “<em>For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD</em>, as the waters cover the sea.” (Hab. 2:14). Jesus made it possible through His sacrifice on the cross to let you share in His glory in heaven. Thus, He is again worthy of your praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God granted the Jews victory when they trusted in His strength, not their own</u>. David trusted in God’s strength, not his own: “The LORD of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah” (Ps. 46:7). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17). “He watches over the feet of His godly ones, but the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; for not by might shall a person prevail.” (1 Sam. 2:9). “In any case, he is not to acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he make the people return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the LORD has said to you, ‘You shall never again return that way.” (Dt. 17:16; 20:1). Thus, Jesus wants you to place your trust in Him for your deliverance, not your own abilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="omnipotence-praise-jesus-for-using-his-power-for-good.-ps.-1135-6."><strong>4. <u>Omnipotence: Praise Jesus For Using His Power for Good</u>. Ps. 113:5-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God has no equal or rival to His power and authority</u>. The psalmist expressed the awe that every saved believer will one day express when in the presence of the King of Kings: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Who is like the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, who is enthroned on high, <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>who looks far down to the heavens and the earth?</em>” (Ps. 113:5-6). Despite being God, Jesus took on the form of a lowly human (Phil. 2:7). He then died to allow death to pass over us: “We must therefore say, with holy admiration, Who is like unto the Lord our God? How condescending in Him to behold the things in the earth! And what amazing condescension was it for the Son of God to come from heaven to earth, and take our nature upon Him, that He might seek and save those that were lost! How vast His love in taking upon Him the nature of man, to ransom guilty souls!” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 113:2).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God has no rival to His power</u>. The Bible proclaims God’s unique power over everything: “Who is like You among the gods, LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?” (Ex. 15:11). “All my bones will say, ‘LORD, who is like You, Who rescues the afflicted from one who is too strong for him, and the afflicted and the poor from one who robs him?”’ (Ps. 35:10). “For Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, You who have done great things; God, who is like You?” (Ps. 71:19). “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For who in the skies is comparable to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? . . . <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of armies, who is like You, mighty <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?” (Ps. 89:6, 8). “Who is like the LORD our God, who is enthroned on high,” (Ps. 113:5). “so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God; there is no one else.” (1 Kgs. 8:60). “You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.” (Dt. 4:35). Thus, Satan is not a rival to God’s power. And there is no problem in your life that is beyond His omnipotent power. He again is worthy of praise.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is in full control over every government</u>. In addition to being sovereign over evil people, God is also sovereign over every power on Earth: “Who establishes the mountains by His strength, who is encircled with might;” (Ps. 65:6). “In whose hand are the depths of the earth, the peaks of the mountains are also His.” (Ps. 95:4). “Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in all the ocean depths.” (Ps. 135:6). Thus, you can turn to God and place your full trust in Him.</p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus because there is no problem He cannot solve<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s will cannot be thwarted</u>.  The psalmist repeatedly claimed that God laughs at our attempts to resist Him:  “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He who sits in the heavens laughs, the Lord scoffs at them.” (Ps. 2:4).  “The Lord laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.”  (Ps. 37:13). “But You, LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.”  (Ps. 69:8).  “Though they intended evil against You and devised a plot, they will not succeed.”  (Ps. 21:11).  “The LORD nullifies the plan of nations; He frustrates the plans of peoples.”  (Ps. 33:10). Throughout the Bible, God also warns that mankind cannot resist His power:  “Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him?  Who could say to Him, ‘What are You doing?”’ (Job 9:12).  “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?”’ (Dan. 4:35).  “ . . . For who resists His will?”  (Ro. 9:19(b)).  “Woe to the one who quarrels with his Maker— A piece of pottery among the other earthenware pottery pieces!  Will the clay say to the potter, ‘What are you doing?’  Or the thing you are making say, ‘He has no hands’?”  (Is. 45:9; Ro. 9:21).  “Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  We are not stronger than He, are we?”  (1 Cor. 10:22).  Are you trying to resist God’s will?</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-praise-jesus-for-delivering-you-out-of-love-for-you.-ps.-1137."><strong>5. <u>Deliverance: Praise Jesus For Delivering You Out of Love for You</u>. Ps. 113:7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God can rescue His people from poverty and sorrow.</u> Even though God’s power is unrivaled and beyond our comprehension, He frequently uses His power to rescue the lowly because He loves mankind: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the garbage heap</em>,” (Ps. 113:7). Psalm 113:7-9 quote from different parts of the song of Hannah where she praised God for hearing her prayers and blessing her with a son, the future prophet Samuel: “<sup>8</sup> He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with nobles, and inherit a seat of honor; for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s<em>,</em> and He set the world on them . . . <sup>10 </sup> . . . and He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed<em>.</em>” (1 Sam. 2:8, 10b).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God hears the cries of the poor, the needy, the sick, and afflicted and acts in His timing</u>. Throughout the Bible, God promises that He hears the cries of those afflicted with poverty, poor health, bondage, or other afflictions: “For the LORD hears the needy, and does not despise those of His who are prisoners.” (Ps. 69:33). ‘“Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, now I will arise,’ says the LORD; ‘I will put him in the safety for which he longs.”’ (Ps. 12:5). “All my bones will say, ‘LORD, who is like You, who rescues the afflicted from one who is too strong for him, and the afflicted and the poor from one who robs him?”’ (Ps. 35:10). “I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the poor.” (Ps. 140:12). “The poor and needy are seeking water, but there is none, and their tongues are parched with thirst. I, the LORD, will answer them Myself; as the God of Israel I will not abandon them.” (Is. 41:17). But you must trust God to act in His timing. Even if He does not remove your suffering here on Earth, He will deliver you and give you an eternal inheritance through Jesus Christ where you will be free from all suffering.</p></li>

<p>Jesus came to lift up the poor, the sick, the needy, and the oppressed<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God lifts up His people when they cry out to Him</u>. Even if God does not immediately lift you out of poverty, illness, or other afflictions, He can lift you up to allow you to feel peace in the midst of your trials: “But You, LORD, are a shield around me, My glory, and <em>the One who lifts my head</em>.” (Ps. 3:3). “A Psalm of David. I will exalt You, LORD, for <em>You have lifted me up</em>, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:1). “But <em>He sets the needy securely on high, away from affliction</em>, and makes his families like a flock.” (Ps. 107:41). Thus, if you need to be lifted up, cry out to Jesus for His help.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God delivers His people from affliction because He loves them</u>. The preceding verses stress God’s omnipotent power. But the psalm concludes by showing how God uses His incredible power to save undeserving people. Why would He do this? Because He loves all mankind. He loves us enough to send His son Jesus Christ to die on the cross so that all who believe in Him will be saved (Jo. 3:16). “This is an instance of his gracious stoop of love: He frequently lifts the lowest of mankind out of their poverty and degradation and places them in positions of power and honour. His good Spirit is continually visiting the down trodden, giving beauty for ashes to those who are cast down, and elevating the hearts of his mourners till they shout for joy.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 113:7).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> “When Jesus sang these words on the night of His betrayal and arrest, it must have occurred to Him that in a sense <em>He</em> was the one who would be lifted from the <strong>dust</strong> of the grave to the highest place.” (David Guzik on Ps. 113:7) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Allow God to use your suffering to refine, mold, and sanctify you</u>. Why would a loving God allow His people to suffer in the first place? Because our sinful nature causes us to drift away from Him when times are good. Thus, God promises to refine believers through the furnace of affliction: “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.” (Is. 48:10). “Therefore this is what the LORD of armies says: “Behold, I will refine them and put them to the test; for what else can I do, because of the daughter of My people?” (Jer. 9:7). “And He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3). “But He knows the way I take; when He has put me to the test, I will come out as gold.” (Job 23:10). “You have refined us as silver is refined<em>.</em>” (Ps. 66:10). Thus, if God does not immediately answer your prayers, trust Him and let Him sanctify and mold you.</p></li>

<h2 id="grace-praise-jesus-for-the-honors-he-gives-you-out-of-grace.-ps.-1138."><strong>6. <u>Grace: Praise Jesus for the Honors He Gives You Out of Grace</u>. Ps. 113:8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God also exalts the humble in His timing</u>. Although mankind is appointed trials on Earth, God promises to one day honor and exalt those who humble themselves before Him: “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>to seat them with noblemen, with the noblemen of His people</em>.” (Ps. 113:8). This again is quoted from part of Hannah’s song: “<sup>8</sup>  . .. and inherit a seat of honor; for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s<em>,</em> and He set the world on them . . . <sup>10 </sup> . . . and He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed<em>.</em>” (1 Sam. 2:8, 10b).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God lifted up His servants when they humbled themselves before Him</u>. The Bible is filled with examples where God lifted up His servants with great honors after first humbling them: “In place of your fathers will be your sons; <em>You shall make them princes in all the earth</em>.” (Ps. 45:16). “So that <em>He sets on high those who are lowly</em>, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.” (Job 5:11). “David’s exaltation springs to mind, then, when Ps. 113:7-8 speaks to the lifting up of the poor from the dust, the needy from the ash heap to sit with the princes of the people. The way the Lord worked with David is similar to the way the Lord took a nation of slaves from the mighty Egypt and the way He sent the King to gather fishermen against the Jerusalem establishment.” (James Hamilton on Ps.118:7-8).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> God honored His servants out of grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of grace, the prodigal son’s father lifted him up and honored Him</u>. The parable of the prodigal son, the wayward son demanded and then squandered his inheritance (Lk. 15:11-17). He confessed his sins to his father (Lk 15:21). Out of grace, the father not only lifted his son out of poverty. He also honored him: “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet; <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>and bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let’s eat and celebrate; <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they began to celebrate.” (Lk. 15:22-24). We also squandered our spiritual inheritance because of sin. Out of grace, Jesus still desires to honor you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of grace, Jesus will honor you when you humble yourself before Him</u>. Jesus promises to exalt and honor those who humble themselves before Him: “He has brought down rulers from their thrones, and <em>has exalted those who were humble</em>.” (Lk. 1:52). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and <em>He will exalt you</em>.” (Jam. 4:10). He “raised us up with Him, and <em>seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus</em>,” (Eph. 2:5-6). “The one who overcomes, and the one who keeps My deeds until the end, <em>I will give him authority over the nations</em>;” (Rev. 2:26). “The one who overcomes, <em>I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne</em>, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.” (Rev. 3:21). “You have made them into a kingdom and priests to our God, and <em>they will reign upon the earth</em>.” (Rev. 5:10). Jesus is again worthy of your praise.</p></li>

<h2 id="new-life-praise-jesus-for-the-new-life-that-he-offers-you.-ps.-1139."><strong>7. <u>New Life: Praise Jesus for the New Life That He Offers You</u>. Ps. 113:9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God offers to all new life</u>. Like an infertile womb, the psalmist praised God for offering a new life that is filled with joy: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>He has the infertile woman live in the house as a joyful mother of children. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 113:9). Here, the psalmist paraphrased the song of Hannah: “Even the infertile woman gives birth to seven, but she who has many children languishes. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> puts to death and makes alive.” (2 Sam. 5b-6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God can deliver the faithful from infertility and oppression</u>. Sara struggled with infertility. Out of grace, God promised to transform Sarah’s dead womb: ‘“Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, at this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.”’ (Gen. 18:14). At age 90, God then miraculously transformed her womb and allowed her to give birth to Issac (Gen. 21:2; Heb. 11:11). Rebekah also struggled with infertility. Rebekah and Isaac turned to God in prayer. After 20 years of prayer, God transformed Rebekah’s womb and allowed her to have children (Gen. 25:21). Hannah suffered from infertility. She cried out to God, and He transformed her womb and allowed her to give birth to Samuel (1 Sam. 1:20). God also used Elisha to transform an infertile woman and also allow her to give birth (2 Kgs. 4:8-17). If you or others suffer from infertility, pray for God to perform a miracle. With God, any miracle is possible: “And looking at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26). ‘“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?”’ (Jer. 32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2).</p></li>

<p>Out of gratitude, Hannah gave her only son Samuel to serve God<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Like a dead womb, we were once dead because of sin</u>. Through faith in Jesus Christ, all are offered the opportunity to be transformed. Where all are dead to sin, Jesus offers new life, like a transformed womb: “And when <em>you were dead in your wrongdoings</em> and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <em>He made you alive</em> together with Him, having forgiven us all our wrongdoings,” (Col. 2:13). “And <em>you were dead in your offenses and sins</em>, . . . even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, <em>made us alive together with Christ</em> (by grace you have been saved),” (Eph. 2:1, 5). Like a restored womb, you must also be born again of the Spirit: “Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”’ (Jo. 3:3). Jesus is again worthy of your praise for saving you from death, transforming you, and offering you new life.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also blessed His believers by making them new creations</u>. If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you can also give thanks that He has made a new creation out of you: “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Cor. 5:17). “Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Ro. 6:4). Yet, you must actively work to make sure that you do not corrupt the new creation that Jesus has created: “and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” (Eph. 4:24). Are you living as a new creation?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God when He restores you from any affliction, disease, or sadness</u>. When He restores you, you should also praise Him (Ps. 113:9). “<em>Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no child</em>; break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed; for the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous than the sons of the married woman,’ says the LORD.” (Is. 54:1). Jesus’ blood can heal you of any infirmity: “But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, and by His scourging we are healed.” (Is. 53:5). If Jesus has healed you from an affliction, offer Him praise and worship.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God can also give new life to a barren nation</u>. In addition to referencing the song of Hannah, this psalm also speaks to God’s promised restoration of Israel. “The Targum, however, again relates the passage to a major historical event for the whole nation, not just the lowly barren woman. It reads, ‘He gives a home to the Assembly of Israel, which may be compared to a barren woman who sits looking anxiously at the men of her house, to be full of crowds, like a mother who rejoices over her children.’ Support for this interpretation (or application) was no doubt derived from the language of Isaiah 54 which compares exiled Israel to a barren woman and promises in the restoration an expanding population. That by the sovereign God. But it was no more supernatural than opening a barren womb and providing a woman like Hannah with children. So the psalmist is using the lines from the Song of Hannah to apply to all such cases where God meets the needs of the oppressed and lonely.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 113:9).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This promise also applies to any nation. God wants you to pray for your nation to repent and be healed: “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chr. 7:14). Are you praying for a spiritual revival?</p></li>
