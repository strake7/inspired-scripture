<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 3 continues Solomon’s prologue to the book of Proverbs (Prov. 1:8-8:36). Here, Solomon taught his son (again possibly his heir Rehoboam) about the blessings that come from obedience to Yahweh’s wisdom. Yahweh is again another name for the great “I AM”. In the New Testament, Jesus reveals that He is the great “I AM” (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Jesus’ promises always come true. But His blessings are always subject to His will and His timing. In His perfect timing and according to His perfect will, faith-led obedience to Jesus’ wisdom can lead to the blessings of: (1) a prolonged life, (2) a good reputation, (3) provision, (4) loving correction, (5) a content peace, (6) protection, and (7) honor from sharing Jesus’ love.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon promised his son that faith-led obedience to the wisdom of Yahweh’s Ten Commandments would prolong his life. Jesus came to fulfill this promise. You may not live to be old. But He will be faithful to prolong that time you otherwise would have on Earth. <u>Second</u>, Solomon further promised his son that if he walked in the wisdom of Yahweh’s Commandments, his reputation would be blessed. Jesus again came to fulfill this promise. <u>Third</u>, Solomon also promised his son that if he trusted Yahweh with his heart and the first fruits of his labor, Yahweh would provide for all his needs. Jesus also fulfills this promise by providing for your needs. <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon also urged his son to accept the wisdom of Yahweh’s loving discipline when he sinned. Jesus also seeks to correct believers when they sin out of love to restore their walk with Him. <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon further revealed to his son that the secret to living a content and peaceful life is to treasure and follow Yahweh’s wisdom. Jesus also came to fulfill this promise. <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon promised his son that Yahweh would protect his path if his son followed the path that Yahweh had set for him. Jesus again came to fulfill this promise. He provides a narrow path and the door for believers. The wise will pray for wisdom to stay on His narrow path. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon promised that if his son treated others with the kind wisdom that Yahweh commanded him to follow, he would be honored. Jesus will also honor those who share His love with others.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience can lead to the blessing of a prolonged life</u>. Solomon urged his son to memorize and obey Yahweh’s Ten Commandments. If done for the right reason, Yahweh would -in His timing and according to Yahweh’s will- prolong his son’s life. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>My son, do not forget my teaching, but have your heart comply with my commandments; <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you</em>.” (Prov. 3:1-2). “The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God’s afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 3:1-18).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Memorize Jesus’ Ten Commandments to fully enjoy His wisdom</u>. Solomon told his son to “<em>not forget my teaching, but have your heart comply with my commandments;</em>” (Prov. 3:1). This echoed the exhortation that Moses gave after the great I AM, Jesus, revealed His Ten Commandments. “These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. And you shall repeat them diligently to your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.” (Dt. 6:6-7). Joshua then repeated this command. “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will achieve success.” (Josh. 1:8). When you memorize the Ten Commandments, the Holy Spirit can convict you when you depart from them. “I have treasured Your word in my heart, so that I may not sin against You.” (Ps. 119:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When your faith leads to obedience, Jesus will “prolong” your life</u>.  Yahweh promised Solomon that He would “prolong” his days if Solomon kept His Ten Commandments and statutes. “And if you walk in My ways, keeping My statutes and commandments, as your father David walked, <em>then I will prolong your days</em>.” (1 Kgs. 3:13). Those who keep God’s Ten Commandments out of love (and not obligation) will also be blessed with a prolonged life “You shall walk entirely in the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and that it may be well for you, and that <em>you may prolong your days</em> in the land which you will possess.” (Dt. 5:33). “. . .  keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and <em>that your days may be prolonged</em>.”  (Dt. 6:2).  “<em>so that you may prolong your days on the land</em> . . .”  (Dt. 11:9).  With the authority given to him, Solomon repeated these promises to both his son and to all mankind (Prov. 3:1-2).  Similar promises also appear in the Psalms. “I will satisfy him with <em>a long life</em>, and show him My salvation.” (Ps. 91:16). “He asked for life from You, You gave it to him, <em>length of days</em> forever and ever.” (Ps. 21:4). The Fourth Commandment also includes a promise to prolong the lives of those who honor their parents. “Those who honor their earthly father and mother and their eternal Father will be blessed with a prolonged life:  “Honor your father and your mother, <em>that your days may be prolonged</em> in the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God gives you.”  (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16; Eph. 6:2-3).  These promises do not mean that you will live until you are old.  You could die at any moment.  But Jesus promises to “prolong” your life when your faith leads to obedience.  You may have an extra minute, a week, a year, a decade, or some other increment of time added to your life time.  Only when you get to heaven will you learn of the amount of time that Jesus has added to your life out of loving grace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ promise of a prolonged life also includes eternal life</u>. Your salvation is not tied to your obedience. But when you have the faith to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you will also receive eternal life, the ultimate fulfillment of a prolonged life. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” (Jo. 3:36). “The world is passing away and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God continues to live forever.” (1 Jo. 2:17). “And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.” (1 Jo. 5:11). Thus, there are many reasons to follow Jesus. The wise will believe in Him and praise Him.</p></li>

<h2 id="good-reputation-faith-led-obedience-to-jesus-wisdom-can-lead-to-the-blessing-of-a-good-reputation.-prov.-33-4."><strong>2. <u>Good Reputation: Faith-Led Obedience to Jesus’ Wisdom Can Lead to the Blessing of a Good Reputation</u>. Prov. 3:3-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience leads to the blessing of good reputation</u>. Solomon promised that if his son walked in the wisdom of Yahweh’s Commandments, he would have a good reputation. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Do not let kindness and truth leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>So you will find favor and a good reputation in the sight of God and man</em>.” (Prov. 3:3-4). “Your character will conciliate for you by its two great elements of <em>mercy and truth</em>, the two corresponding tributes of good-will and respect.” (Thomas Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Prov. 3:4).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Cling to the wisdom of Jesus’ “<em>Hesed</em></u>.” Solomon urged his son, “<em>Do not let </em>‘<span dir="rtl">חֶ֥סֶד</span>’ (ḥe·seḏ) <em>and truth leave you</em> …” (Prov. 3:3). This was a reference to Yahweh’s holy character. It is rich in meaning but without a single agreed upon English translation. The NASB translates it as “<em>kindness</em>.” The KJB and NKV both translate this as “<em>mercy</em>”. The NIV translates this as “<em>love</em>.” The Berean Bible translates this as “<em>loving devotion</em>.” The Christian Standard Bible translates this as “<em>loyalty</em>.”<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In effect, Solomon urged his son to fully trust in Yahweh’s covenant love and truth with all his heart in everything he did. Yahweh in turn promised to put His Covenant in any believer’s heart through the Holy Spirit. “For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the LORD: “I will put My law within them and write it on their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; 10:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus promises to bless those with faith-led obedience with a good reputation</u>. Although believers should not be motivated to seek the approval of mankind, Solomon extolled the wisdom to pursuing a good reputation through obedience to Yahweh’s Commandments. “A good name is to be more desired than great wealth; favor is better than silver and gold.” (Prov. 22:1). “A good name is better than good oil, and the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.” (Ecc. 7:1). A good reputation does not mean an easy life without trials. But it does bring respect from even those who are opposed to you. As a slave, Joseph found favor when he faithfully served God with integrity. “So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and put him in charge of all that he owned.” (Gen. 39:4). “But the LORD was with Joseph and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison.” (Gen. 39:21). Samuel also received favor when he served God with faith-led obedience. “Now the boy Samuel was continuing to grow and to be in favor both with the LORD and with people.” (1 Sam. 2:26). David also received favor before Saul when he served with faith-led obedience. “So Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, ‘Let David now be my attendant for he has found favor in my sight.”’ (1 Sam. 16:22). Daniel also received favor as He faithfully served God. “Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials.” (Dan. 1:9). As our example, Jesus also received favor as He faithfully served God the Father. “And Jesus continued to advance in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.” (Lk. 2:52). Jesus also offers this blessing when you faithfully serve Him. “For the one who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by other people.” (Ro. 14:18).</p></li>

<h2 id="provision-faith-led-obedience-to-jesus-wisdom-can-lead-to-the-blessing-of-his-provision.-prov.-35-10."><strong>3. <u>Provision: Faith-Led Obedience to Jesus’ Wisdom Can Lead to the Blessing of His Provision</u>. Prov. 3:5-10.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience can lead to the blessing of Jesus’ provision</u>. Solomon further promised his son that if he trusted Yahweh with his heart and the first fruits of his labor, Yahweh would provide for all his needs. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and turn away from evil. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Honor the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from your wealth, and from the first of all your produce; <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine</em>.” (Prov. 3:5-10). In summary, Solomon extolled here some of the many blessings of trusting in Yahweh. <strong>“He shall direct your paths</strong>: This is the great principle of God’s response towards those who trust Him in the way described in the previous lines. When we <strong>acknowledge Him</strong> in our <strong>ways</strong>, He will <strong>direct</strong> our <strong>paths</strong> in the fulfillment of His will, into what is right before Him and pleasing to us. More than a few are <em>afraid</em> to have God <strong>direct</strong> their <strong>paths</strong>. They would much rather direct themselves! This, fundamentally, is the heart that <em>does not</em> trust in the LORD with all the heart. The surrendered heart delights in God’s direction and in God’s paths. One of the most frequently asked questions among believers is, “How can I know the will of God?” In principle, Solomon gave a wonderful answer in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Proverbs+3.5-6&amp;t=NKJV">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. When we: · Decide to put our trust in the LORD. · Decide to not trust in our own understanding, but give attention and priority to God’s revealed word. · Decide to acknowledge and honor God in all that we do. When we do those things, we can trust that God will <strong>direct</strong> our <strong>paths</strong>. We can go forward in peace, believing that through His word, through the leading of the Holy Spirit, through the counsel of others, through godly common sense, and through life circumstances, God will <strong>direct</strong> our <strong>paths</strong>. We will walk along our way of life and come to see that we have been on the path God intended all along.” (David Guzik on Prov. 3:5-6) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you trust in Jesus, He will keep you on the right path</u>. Solomon promised that if you fully trust in Yahweh, He will “<em>make your paths straight.</em>” (Prov. 3:6). When you trust Jesus, He will make the right path known to you. “I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will advise you with My eye upon you.” (Ps. 32:8). “Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, ‘This is the way, walk in it,’ whenever you turn to the right or to the left.” (Is. 30:21). But Jesus’ sheep both hear His voice and then have the obedience to follow His voice to stay on the right path. “My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;” (Jo. 10:27).</p></li>

<p>Trust in Jesus’ wisdom to direct your path, and do not rely upon your own wisdom<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Only a fool trusts in his or her own wisdom and wealth</u>. Solomon warned “<em><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and turn away from evil.</em>” (Prov. 3:7). Those who trust in their own wisdom or wealth become fools in God’s eyes. “Do you see a person wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.” (Prov. 26:12). “Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight!” (Is. 5:21). “Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; and <em>the wisdom of their wise men will perish</em>, and the understanding of their men who have understanding will be concealed.” (Is. 29:14; 1 Cor. 1:19-21; 2:7-10; 3:10; Ro. 1:22). To fully trust God, you must have a child-like faith. “At that time Jesus said, ‘I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants.”’ (Matt. 11:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wisdom of Jesus also leads to the blessing of healing</u>. Solomon also promised the blessing of healing if his son obeyed the wisdom of Yahweh’s Commandments. “<em><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.</em>” (Prov. 3:8). All have sinned and fallen short of the Ten Commandments (Prov. 20:9; Ecc. 7:20; Ps. 14:2-3; 53:2-3; Ro. 3:23). If this conviction of sin leads to repentance, Jesus promises to heal the sinner. This can be an emotional or sometimes a physical healing. “Who pardons all your guilt, who heals all your diseases;” (Ps. 103:3; Ex. 15:26; Jer. 33:6; Is. 53:5; 1 Pet. 2:24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Your obedience and tithing show your trust in Jesus</u>. Solomon urged his son to honor Yahweh with the first fruits of his labors (Prov. 3:9-10). The late famous American pastor and radio commentator J. Vernon McGee (1904-1988) observed how Proverbs 3:5-6 were well-known but seldom fully understood verses within his congregation. “In a service where folk are invited to give their favorite verses, these verses are invariably quoted …[But] Don’t tell me you are totally committed to the Lord until your pocketbook is committed too. Some folk may say, ‘I have worked hard. I earned this.’ But who gave you the health to work? Who gave you the work to do? Who made it possible for you to make money? My friend, God did all that for you. Acknowledge Him. That is the evidence of total commitment.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 3:3-6 &amp; 3:9-10).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Show your trust for Jesus by giving Him the first fruits of your time, talent, and treasure<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you trust in Jesus, He will also bless you with His fruit</u>. Jeremiah stated that the person who fully trusts the Lord becomes like a well-watered tree. It will bear fruit and have deep roots to endure any trial. “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD. For he will be like a tree planted by the water that extends its roots by a stream, and does not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought, Nor cease to yield fruit.” (Jer. 17:7-8). This analogy is also stated in the beginning of the Psalms. “He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season, And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.” (Ps. 1:3). When you fully trust Jesus and give Him the best of your time, talent, and treasure, He will bless the fruit your produce for Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you delight in Jesus’ wisdom, He will give you the desires of your heart</u>. Tithing is the one place where God tells believers to “test Him.” ‘“Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and put Me to the test now in this,”’ says the LORD of armies, ‘if I do not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.”’ (Mal. 3:10). But trusting Jesus to provide for your needs should never be turned into a promise of a “prosperity gospel.” For some, money, wealth, or power can lead to the sin of covetousness. Or, these things lead some to place their trust in themselves. Jesus instead promises to give you the desires of your heart when you desire for His will to be fulfilled. “Trust in the LORD and do good; live in the land and cultivate faithfulness. Delight yourself in the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:3-4). “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:10).</p></li>

<h2 id="loving-correction-faith-led-obedience-to-jesus-wisdom-can-lead-to-the-blessing-of-jesus-loving-correction.-prov.-311-12."><strong>4. <u>Loving Correction: Faith-Led Obedience to Jesus’ Wisdom Can Lead to the Blessing of Jesus’ Loving Correction</u>. Prov. 3:11-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience accepts the blessing of Jesus’ loving correction</u>. Solomon also urged his son to accept the wisdom of Yahweh’s loving discipline when he sinned to restore his fellowship. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>My son, do not reject the discipline of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> or loathe His rebuke, <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>for whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> loves He disciplines, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights</em>.” (Prov. 3:11-12). “A logical <em>because</em> assures the son that though the discipline may be harsh, it is oxymoronically, <em>I AM</em>’s ‘severe mercy.’ It is reserved for <em>those whom I AM loves</em>. … C.S. Lewis illustrates this truth by noting the care an artist takes over a beloved work of art. If the work of art were alive, as ‘the artist rubbed and scraped off and recommenced for the tenth time, it would cry out in pain. When we complain about our sufferings, Lewis concludes, we are in fact asking for less love. Verset 12b represents <em>I AM</em> as a loving <em>father</em> (see 1:22; cf. 13:25; Deut. 8:5; Heb. 12:3-12) who wants <em>the son</em> to experience the blessings of these verses. However, for that, the son must obey the commandments of the odd verses. God’s discipline, therefore, is to ensure the son fulfills his obligations.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 3:11-12).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus disciplines those He loves</u>.  Jesus disciplines sinners the same way a loving father disciplines a wayward child:  “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,”  (2 Sam. 7:14). In a similar way, Jesus disciplines His people out of love:  “Thus you are to know in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5).  “It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?” (Heb. 12:7).  “But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.”  (1 Cor. 11:32).  If Jesus has disciplined you, pray about how and why you have sinned. Jesus then wants you to repent. “Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.” (Rev. 3:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who accept Jesus’ discipline and turn back to Him will be blessed</u>. Although the blessing of obedience to Yahweh’s discipline is not expressly stated in Solomon’s address to his son, it is promised in the book of Psalms. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>Blessed is the man whom You discipline, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and whom You teach from Your Law,</em>” (Ps. 94:12). When you accept Jesus’ discipline and return to His path, He will restore His blessings in His timing.</p></li>

<h2 id="a-content-peace-faith-led-obedience-to-jesus-wisdom-can-lead-to-the-blessing-of-contentment-and-peace.-prov.-313-20."><strong>5. <u>A Content Peace: Faith-Led Obedience to Jesus’ Wisdom Can Lead to the Blessing of Contentment and Peace</u>. Prov. 3:13-20.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience can lead to Jesus’ blessing of contentment and peace</u>. Solomon further revealed to his son that the secret to living a content and peaceful life is to treasure and faithfully follow the wisdom of Yahweh’s Commandments. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her produce better than gold. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and happy are those who hold on to her. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> founded the earth by wisdom, He established the heavens by understanding. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>By His knowledge the ocean depths were burst open, and the clouds drip with dew</em>.” (Prov. 3:13-20). “The man that has true happiness is the one that follows God’s plan of instruction. God’s wisdom will never fail you. Your mind will sometimes reject God’s way, but if you will go ahead and do it the way God said, you will truly know the inward joy of serving Him.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 3:13).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom should be your greatest treasure</u>. Solomon declared that those who understand and follow the treasures of Yahweh’s wisdom are blessed (Prov. 3:3-15; see also, 2:4-5; 8:10-11; 16:16). Job revealed that God’s wisdom is greater than any worldly treasure (Job 28:15-19). Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). “[I]n whom are hidden all the <em>treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes His wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Continually seek out Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Jesus also wants you to continually seek out His wisdom as your greatest treasure: “Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.” (1 Chr. 16:11). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.” (Ps. 51:6). “Seek the LORD so that you may live, . . .” (Amos 5:6a). Are you seeking out His wisdom as your greatest treasure?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom brings contentment and peace</u>. Solomon stated that Yahweh’s wisdom offers “<em>pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.</em> (Prov. 3:17). He also stated that those who follow Yahweh’s wisdom will be “<em>happy</em>.” (Prov. 3:18). Jesus warns that you will also experience tribulation in the world (Jo. 16:33). But when your faith leads to obedience, He promises you the peace that surpasses all understanding (Phil. 4:7). This includes giving you courage in the face of any trial. “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7). Jesus further promises you rest, contentment, and a light burden when you follow His wisdom. “Come to Me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for you’re your souls. For My yoke is comfortable, and My burden is light.” (Matt. 11:28-30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who are wise enough to follow Jesus’ wisdom will one day eat from the tree of life</u>. Solomon stated that Yahweh’s wisdom “<em>is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,</em>” (Prov. 3:18). To those who have the wisdom to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior, He promises that they will one day joyfully eat from the tree of life. “The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes, <em>I will grant to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God</em>.” (Rev. 2:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust in Jesus’ promises because He is omnipotent and omniscient</u>. Solomon stated that his son could trust Yahweh’s promises because Yahweh created all things with His “<em>wisdom</em>” (Prov. 3:19-20). Jesus created all things (Jo. 1:1-3; Heb. 1:2-3; Col. 1:16-17). Thus, you can also trust Jesus because He has the power to fulfill all His promises.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience can lead to Jesus’ protection</u>. Solomon also promised his son that obedience would bring the blessings of Yahweh’s protection. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>My son, see that they do not escape from your sight; comply with sound wisdom and discretion, <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>and they will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Then you will walk in your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Do not be afraid of sudden danger, nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes; <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being caught</em>.” (Prov. 3:21-26). “Let us not suffer Christ’s words to depart from us, but keep sound wisdom and discretion; then shall we walk safely in his ways. The natural life, and all that belongs to it, shall be under the protection of God’s providence; the spiritual life, and all its interests, under the protection of his grace, so that we shall be kept from falling into sin or trouble.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 3:21-26).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has given you wisdom through the Holy Spirit to have discernment</u>. Solomon urged his son to “<em>comply with sound wisdom and discretion</em>.” (Prov. 3:21). Through His Word, the Holy Spirit, and prayer, Jesus offers all believers “a spirit of wisdom” to discern good from evil. “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you <em>a spirit of wisdom</em> and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.” (Eph. 1:17). But, like Solomon’s son, you must follow the wisdom revealed to you to be blessed.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will guard you when you follow His wisdom</u>. If his son followed Yahweh’s wisdom, Solomon promised him “<em>life to your soul</em>,” the ability to “<em>walk in your way securely,</em>” without stumbling, without fear, and “<em>confidence</em>.” (Prov. 3:22-26). Subject to His timing and His will, Jesus’ wisdom offers protection when followed. “Discretion will watch over you, <em>understanding will guard you</em>,” (Prov. 2:11). “Do not abandon her, and she will guard you; love her, and <em>she will watch over you</em>.” (Prov. 4:6). “<em>For wisdom is protection</em> just as money is protection, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom keeps its possessors alive.” (Ecc. 7:12). When you walk in Jesus’ wisdom by living with integrity, He will be your shield against the enemy’s attacks. “He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; <em>He is a shield to those who walk in integrity</em>,” (Prov. 2:7).</p></li>

<p>Jesus will be your shield and protect you when you walk in His wisdom<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ protection includes the blessing of freedom from fear</u>. Those who follow Jesus’ wisdom do not need to be “<em>afraid of sudden danger, nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes;</em>” (Prov. 3:25). In the face of danger, “<em>the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will be your confidence,</em>” (Prov. 3:26). The protection that Jesus offers is the ability to be free from the fear of evil people. Evil has no power against Jesus. “The LORD is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me?” (Ps. 118:6; Heb. 13:6). “In God, whose word I praise, in God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?” (Ps. 56:4). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ protection includes the blessing of restful sleep</u>. The freedom from fear that Jesus offers includes the important blessing of sleep. “<em>when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</em>” (Prov. 3:24). “In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You alone, LORD, have me dwell in safety.” (Ps. 4:8). “It is futile for you to rise up early, to stay up late, to eat the bread of painful labor; this is how He gives to His beloved sleep.” (Ps. 127:2). Jesus offers protection from worry and anxiety when you trust Him (Matt. 6:25-35).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Faith-led obedience can lead to the blessing of God’s honor</u>. Solomon promised that if his son treated others with the kind wisdom that Yahweh commanded him to follow, he would be honored. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Do not say to your neighbor, ‘Go, and come back, and tomorrow I will give it to you,’ When you have it with you. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Do not devise harm against your neighbor, while he lives securely beside you. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>Do not contend with a person for no reason, if he has done you no harm. <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Do not envy a violent person, and do not choose any of his ways. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>For the devious are an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; but He is intimate with the upright. <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>The curse of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the home of the righteous. <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Though He scoffs at the scoffers, yet He gives grace to the needy. <strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>The wise will inherit honor, but fools increase dishonor</em>.” (Prov. 3:27-35). “The wise shall inherit glory,.... [They] are wise unto salvation; who know themselves, the sinfulness of their nature, their inability to do that which is good, and their want of righteousness to justify them before God; who are sensible of the sickness and diseases of their souls, their spiritual poverty, and their great folly and ignorance with respect to things of a spiritual nature; who know Christ, and him crucified, the way of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by him; … Now these shall ‘inherit glory’; not the glory of this world, or honor among men … it is an eternal glory which Christ is entered into … this they shall enjoy as an inheritance; not by purchase or acquisition, but by free gift; … through the death of Christ the testator, and will be possessed forever, as inheritances run;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 3:35).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom includes the command to love others and help those in need</u>. Solomon warned his son to be kind and loving to those in need (Prov. 3:27-28). This is repeated at the end of Proverbs. “The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern.” (Prov. 31:9). Jesus’ wisdom also includes His command to love others and help those in need. “But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?” (1 Jo. 3:17). “If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?” (Jam. 2:15-16). “If there is a poor man with you, one of your brothers, in any of your towns in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart, nor close your hand from your poor brother;” (Dt. 15:7). “Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you<em>.</em>” (Matt. 5:44). “But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,” (Lk. 14:13). “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.” (Ps. 82:3). “[D]o justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.” (Micah 6:8). “[L]earn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, and plead for the widow.” (Is. 1:17). “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.” (Dt. 10:18; Jer. 22:3; Ezek. 18:21; Zech. 7:9; Matt. 23:23; Jam. 1:27). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom also includes loving and not harming others</u>. Solomon also warned against causing harm to others and being unnecessarily contentious (Prov. 3:29-30). “Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.” (Ro. 13:10). “For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”’ (Gal. 5:14; Jam. 2:8). “Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” (Ps. 34:14; 1 Pet. 3:11). “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.” (Ro. 12:18; Heb. 12:14; 2 Cor. 13:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will honor those who follow His wisdom, and judgment for those who reject it</u>. Those who reject the fear of the Lord and embrace evil are “<em>an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em><span class="smallcaps">.”</span> (Prov. 3:23). If they fail to repent, they will eventually face “<em>The curse of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>” and “<em>dishonor</em>.” (Prov. 3:24, 35). In contrast, He offers “<em>blessings</em>,” “<em>grace</em>” and “<em>honor</em>” to those who offer love and support to those in need (Prov. 3:33-35). These blessings will include honor and eternal life in heaven. “<em>to those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life</em>;” (Ro. 2:7).</p></li>
