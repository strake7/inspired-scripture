<p><strong>1. <u>Faithfulness: Rejoice in God’s Faithfulness in Keeping His Word</u>. Ps. 33:1-4.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist rejoiced and praised God’s faithfulness</u>. The unidentified psalmist played musical instruments and sang with joy to praise both God’s Word and His faithfulness: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Sing for joy in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you righteous ones; praise is becoming to the upright. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with the lyre; sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy. <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>For the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is right, and all His work is done in faithfulness</em>.” (Ps. 33:1-4). The psalmist was careful to observe that praise was “<em>becoming</em>” when offered from “<em>the upright</em>” (Ps. 33:1). In other words, it carries more meaning to God when you are trying to follow after Him. “To rejoice in temporal comforts is dangerous, to rejoice in self is foolish, to rejoice in sin is fatal, but to rejoice in God is heavenly.” (Charles Spurgeon (1834 – 1892 AD) on Ps. 33).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God is worthy of your praise</u>. The Psalms are filled with similar praises for God: “But <em>the righteous</em> will be joyful; they <em>will rejoice before God</em>; yes, they will rejoice with gladness.” (Ps. 68:3). “<em>Be joyful</em> in the LORD, <em>you righteous ones</em>, and praise the mention of His holy name.” (Ps. 97:12). “I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Sing the glory of His name; Make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:2). “<em>I will also praise You</em> with a harp, and Your truth, my God; I will sing praises to You with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.” (Ps. 71:22). “It is good to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to Your name, Most High;” (Ps. 92:1). “<em>Praise the LORD</em>! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant and praise is beautiful.” (Ps. 147:1). The New Testament also exhorts you to rejoice in God’s holy character: “<em>Rejoice in the Lord always</em>; again I will say, <em>rejoice</em>!” (Phil. 4:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rejoice in God’s faithfulness</u>. The Psalms are also filled with praises for God’s faithfulness: “Your mercy, LORD, extends to the heavens, <em>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies</em>.” (Ps. 36:5). “I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; <em>I have spoken of Your faithfulness</em> and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation.” (Ps. 40:10). “I will sing of the graciousness of the LORD forever; to all generations <em>I will make Your faithfulness known</em> with my mouth.” (Ps. 89:1). “<em>Your faithfulness continues throughout generations</em>; You established the earth, and it stands.” (Ps. 119:90). Are your praising God’s faithfulness?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ faithfulness</u>. You can thank Jesus that His Word is true, and He is faithful to keep His promises: “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His faithfulness to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.” (1 Thess. 5:24). Among His many promises, Jesus is faithful to keep His promise to never forsake His people: “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6; 4:31; Heb. 13:5; Is. 43:25). “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.” (1 Thess. 5:24; Nu. 23:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rejoice that God remains faithful even when you are not</u>. If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He will also keep His many promises to you, even when you are unfaithful to Him: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you given thanks that Jesus is faithful even when you are not?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <u>Righteousness: Rejoice Because God is Righteous, Just, and Good</u>. Ps. 33:5.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist rejoiced in God’s righteousness</u>. The psalmist then praised God for being righteous, just, and filling the Earth with His goodness for the benefit of mankind: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the goodness of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Ps. 33:5). Even though evil may at times seem to prevail, God’s justice will ultimately prevail.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He is righteous and just</u>. The Psalms contain many similar praises for God’s righteousness: “I will give thanks to the LORD <em>according to His righteousness</em> and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.” (Ps. 7:17). “<em>For the LORD is righteous</em>, <em>He loves righteousness</em>; the upright will see His face.” (Ps. 11:7). “Praise the LORD, for <em>the LORD is good</em>; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.” (Ps. 135:3). “<em>The righteous will rejoice</em> when he sees vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.” (Ps. 58:10). “My mouth shall tell of <em>Your righteousness</em> and of Your salvation all day long; for I do not know the art of writing.” (Ps. 71:15). “Rejoice, you nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and will return vengeance on His adversaries, and will atone for His land and His people.” (Dt. 32:43).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He can also make you righteous</u>. Although all have sinned and deserve judgment, Jesus can also make you righteous: “For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.” (Ro. 5:19). Because He has made you righteous, He calls upon you to keep yourself consecrated by staying holy (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-45; 19:2). Are you living your life as a holy living sacrifice for Jesus (Ro. 12:1-2)?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will rule with divine righteousness and perfect justice</u>. Jesus is the King of Kings (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 1:5; 17:14; 19:16). He sits on an eternal throne (Rev. 3:21). His future reign will be righteous: “Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation; then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.” (Ps. 51:14). And His rule will also be just. “Your throne, God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice.” (Ps. 45:6; 110:2; Heb. 1:8). Because He will one day right every wrong, you never need to take justice into your own hands (Ro. 12:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge God’s enemies</u>. David promised that the King of Kings would eliminate God’s enemies (Ps. 21:8-10). God the Father has given Jesus full authority to judge evil: “For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.” (Jo. 5:22). For those who reject Jesus’ mercy, they will be judged according to their own deeds: “For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works” (Matt. 16:27). “For He repays a person for his work, and lets things happen in correspondence to a man’s behavior.” (Job 34:11; Ro. 2:6). “Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to reward each one as his work deserves.” (Rev. 22:12). Most would not like to think of themselves as wicked. Yet, without Jesus, every person faces judgment. “But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,” (Ro. 2:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ perfect justice includes mercy</u>. Some are troubled by God’s judgment. Yet, God would not be “just” if He ignored evil. God also gives us these prophecies to warn everyone. He does not want any to perish: “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9). As a just and loving God, Jesus’ perfect justice also includes mercy: “A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; to You, LORD, I will sing praises.” (Ps. 101:1). Anyone who repents and confesses Jesus as Lord and Savior can be forgiven (Jo. 3:16). Are you spreading the good news (Matt. 28:16-20)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. <u>Omnipotence: Rejoice Because God is All-Powerful and Loving</u>. Ps. 33:6-9.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist praised God for using His power to create the perfect Earth for mankind</u>. The psalmist then rejoiced because God used His power to create the Earth for mankind: “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>By the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their lights. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He puts the depths in storehouses. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Let all the earth fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood firm</em>.” (Ps. 33:6-9). The Apostle Paul proclaimed that those who refuse to see God’s power in creation are “without excuse”: “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, that is, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, being understood by what has been made, so that they are without excuse.” (Rom. 1:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Bible confirms God’s creation of the universe</u>. God created the universe in two steps. First, He spoke the universe into existence: “the Universe was formed at God’s command” for “He spoke and it came to be” (Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:9). Second, on 12 separate occasions, five different Old Testament writers revealed that God then “stretched out” the stars from a small starting point to their present locations: “who alone <em>stretches out</em> the heavens” (Job 9:8; 26:7; Ps. 104:1-2; Is. 40:22; 42:5; 44:24; 45:12; 51:13; Jer. 10:12; 32:17; 51:15; Zech. 12:1). Throughout history, most have considered the universe to be eternal. But these Biblical authors, under the inspiration of the Spirit, miraculously described what astronomers would not understand until thousands of years later.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He created the perfect universe and Earth out of love for mankind</u>. David saw the “<em>glory</em>” of God in the night sky (Ps. 19:1). He also saw the glory of God above all His creation of the Earth. “A Psalm of David. LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth, You who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!” (Ps. 8:1). The famous British philosopher and scientist Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626 AD) once declared “A little science estranges a man from God; a lot of science brings him back.” The study of science is not something that you need to run from as a believer. It instead provides the undeniable evidence of God’s glory and His creation. Are you praising Jesus for the glory of His creation when you look at nature?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He uses His power to make the impossible possible</u>. When you look at God’s omnipotent power in creation, it might feel remote or distant from your life. But God loves you and uses His power to strengthen you: “My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.” (Ps. 73:26). God cares so much for you that He can even use His power to create to even restore an infertile couple: “Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was unable to have children; and the LORD answered him, and his wife Rebekah conceived.” (Gen. 25:21). Have you given thanks for God’s creation, your life, and His many miracles in your life?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <u>Sovereignty: Rejoice Because God is in Control and Protects You</u>. Ps. 33:10-12.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist rejoiced in God’s sovereignty</u>. The psalmist then praised God because He is in control of all things and uses His power to protect His people from all types of evil: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> nullifies the plan of nations; He frustrates the plans of peoples. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The plan of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> stands forever, the plans of His heart from generation to generation. <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Blessed is the nation whose God is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the people He has chosen for His own inheritance</em>.” (Ps. 33:10-12). No person can thwart God’s preordained plans. “Many plans are in a person’s heart, but the advice of the LORD will stand.” (Prov. 19:21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God because He uses His power to help the powerless against the mighty</u>. Throughout the Jews’ history, God repeatedly showed His sovereign power any time the Jews put their trust in Him: “Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, ‘LORD, there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; help us, LORD our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. LORD, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You.”’ (2 Chr. 14:11). If you place your trust in Him, God can also deliver you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign and in control over all history</u>. God has controlled events throughout history to fulfill His plans for mankind. He can control the heart of any leader or individual to fulfill His plans: “The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He wishes.” (Prov. 21:1). Daniel explained: “It is He [God] who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.” (Da. 2:21). “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23). “Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.” (Is. 40:15). “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” (Ps. 10:16). “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; . . .” (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35). Even when evil surrounds you, do you trust that God is in control?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is sovereign over the nations</u>. Jesus has full authority over the nations: “And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.”’ (Matt. 28:18). “Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”’ (Rev. 11:15). He also seeks to share His authority with all who remain faithful: “The one who overcomes, and the one who keeps My deeds until the end, I will give him authority over the nations;” (Rev. 2:26).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He uses His sovereignty for good</u>. You can give thanks that Jesus uses His power over evil to cause all things to work together for His greater good: “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28). You may never know the reason for your suffering. But you can rest assured that Jesus has a greater plan for you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God that He will protect any nation that calls upon Him as its God</u>. God did not limit His protection to the Jews. Instead, He promises to protect <em>any</em> nation that puts its faith in Him. “<em><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Blessed is the nation whose God is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the people He has chosen for His own inheritance</em>.” (Ps. 33:12). “Blessed are the people who are so situated; blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!” (Ps. 144:15). God blessed the nations which sent out missionaries. But as many of those nations have renounced their faith, God’s blessings have slowly disappeared. Thus, every believer should pray for revival.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. <u>Omniscience: Rejoice Because God Knows Your Every Need</u>. Ps. 33:13-15.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist praised God for using His all-knowing power for mankind’s benefit</u>. The psalmist then rejoiced because God used His omniscience to help in our times of need: “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of mankind; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>from His dwelling place He looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works</em>.” (Ps. 33:13-15). While it is true that an all-knowing God knows our sins, it is the devil and his angels who need to fear God’s omniscience. If you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, all your sins will be forgiven. You can then take comfort that the enemy’s plans are all known to God. He can protect you from an attack before it ever happens. He can also guide your every step for good.</p></li>
<li><p><u>No sin can be concealed before the omniscient Creator</u>. God is omniscient (all-knowing). This includes the Father (Ps. 147:5), the Son (Jo. 16:30), and the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 2:10). Job once declared that God is infinitely wise and knows each person’s actions: “For His eyes are upon the ways of a person, and He sees all his steps.” (Job 34:21). Solomon also proclaimed that nothing could be hidden from God: “then hear in heaven, Your dwelling place, and forgive and act, and give to each in accordance with all his ways, whose heart You know—for You alone know the hearts of all mankind—” (1 Kgs. 8:39). “The eyes of the LORD are in every place, watching the evil and the good.” (Prov. 15:3). “For the eyes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> move to and fro throughout the earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His.”’ (2 Chr. 16:9(a)). “For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their wrongdoing concealed from My eyes.” (Jer. 16:17; Ps. 130:3). “And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.” (Heb. 4:13). Are you living life knowing that nothing is hidden from God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for using His omniscience to guide and help you</u>. In His perfect knowledge, Jesus has given you His Word to guide your every step: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). “Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day.” (Ps. 25:5). If you study the Word, the Holy Spirit can then cause you to remember it to light the right path for you: “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26). You can trust that Jesus uses His perfect knowledge out of love to protect and guide you: “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “Commit your way to the LORD, trust also in Him, and He will do it.” (Ps. 37:5). “Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah” (Ps. 62:8). “Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be afraid; for the LORD GOD is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation.” (Is. 12:2). Are you trusting in Jesus and praising Him for watching over you and guiding you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <u>Salvation: Rejoice Because God Offers You a Path to Salvation</u>. Ps. 33:16-19.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist rejoiced in God’s deliverance and salvation</u>. The psalmist then praised God because He delivers those who put their trust in Him, and He offers a path to salvation: “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Behold, the eye of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is on those who fear Him, on those who wait for His faithfulness, <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>to rescue their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.”</em> (Ps. 33:16-19). Peter later quoted from Ps. 33:18 to advise that God’s protection is available to any with faith in Jesus Christ: “For the eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears attend to their prayer, but the face of the LORD is against evildoers.” (1 Pet. 3:12). God’s protection does not extend to those who trust in themselves or the world.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God granted the Jews victory when they trusted in His strength, not their own</u>. David boasted that the Jews’ victories would come through God and not their military might: “<sup>7 </sup>Some praise their chariots and some their horses, but we will praise the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). He knew that God was their true strength: “The LORD is their strength, and He is a refuge of salvation to His anointed.” (Ps. 28:8). Thus, he trusted in God’s strength, not his own: “The LORD of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah” (Ps. 46:7). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17). “He watches over the feet of His godly ones, but the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; for not by might shall a person prevail.” (1 Sam. 2:9). “In any case, he is not to acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he make the people return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the LORD has said to you, ‘You shall never again return that way.” (Dt. 17:16; 20:1). “They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were handed over to them; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered their prayers because they trusted in Him.” (1 Chr. 5:20). “The sons of Israel were subdued at that time, and the sons of Judah conquered because they trusted in the LORD, the God of their fathers.” (2 Chr. 13:18). God’s offer of protection extends to you as well.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not place your trust in strong leaders</u>. The Bible repeatedly warns against placing your trust in strong leaders for your salvation: “Oh give us help against the enemy, for rescue by man is worthless.” (Ps. 60:11). “Do not trust in noblemen, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). Jesus is the only one with the power to deliver you: “The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.” (Ps. 110:5; Rev. 6:17). “When he falls, he will not be hurled down, because the LORD is the One who holds his hand.” (Ps. 37:24). “Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” (Ps. 55:22). “Commit your works to the LORD, and your plans will be established.” (Prov. 16:3; 17:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God that He can deliver you when you rely on His strength and not your own</u>. When you take refuge in God, you can also rejoice in His protection: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “Sing to God, sing praises to His name; exalt Him who rides through the deserts, whose name is the LORD, and be jubilant before Him.” (Ps. 68:4). Are you praising God for His protection in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He is the God of salvation who delivers you from death</u>. For those who trust in God, He will also “<em>rescue their soul from death</em>” (Ps. 33:19). In Jesus’ day, the Sadducees doubted the existence of an afterlife. But David repeatedly praised God as the source of his “salvation” (Ps. 21:1). “<em>Salvation belongs to the LORD;</em> may Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah” (Ps. 3:8). “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be <em>the God of my salvation</em>, . . . He gives <em>great salvation</em> to His king, and shows faithfulness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” (Ps. 18:46, 50). “The LORD is their strength, and He is a refuge of <em>salvation to His anointed</em>.” (Ps. 28:8). “But the <em>salvation</em> of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their strength in time of trouble.” (Ps. 37:39). “Yet I will triumph in the LORD, I will rejoice in <em>the God of my salvation</em>.” (Hab. 3:18). “Help us, <em>God of our salvation</em>, for the glory of Your name; and save us and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.” (Ps. 79:9). ““He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, My God, and <em>the rock of my salvation</em>.”’ (Ps. 89:26). “GOD the Lord, <em>the strength of my salvation</em>, You have covered my head on the day of battle.” (Ps. 140:7). This salvation included the promise of living forever with God in heaven: “It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; for the LORD commanded the blessing there—<em>life forever</em>.” (Ps. 133:3). “The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be my God, <em>the rock of my salvation</em>,” (2 Sam. 22:47). “The LORD is my strength and song, and <em>He has become my salvation</em>; this is my God, and I will praise Him; My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.” (Ex. 15:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is your Redeemer</u>. Job professed faith in his Redeemer: “Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.” (Job 19:25). Your redemption is only possible through God: “I, only I, am the LORD, and there is no savior besides Me.” (Is. 43:11). Jesus is your Redeemer who offers you salvation: “and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”’ (Rev. 7:10). “She will give birth to a Son; and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” (Matt. 1:21). “And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among mankind by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12). “For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,” (1 Tim. 2:5). Are you singing praises to Jesus for your deliverance and your eternal salvation?</p></li>

<p>7. <strong><u>Hope: Rejoice Because God Offers You Hope When You Trust Him</u>. Ps. 33:20-22.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The psalmist praised God for giving hope to those who put their trust in Him</u>. The psalmist concluded by rejoicing because God had given him hope and the patience to wait for God’s perfect timing: <em>“<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Our soul waits for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; He is our help and our shield. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>For our heart rejoices in Him, because we trust in His holy name. <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Let Your favor, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, be upon us, just as we have waited for You</em>.” (Ps. 33:20-22). “Having praised Him and considered God’s greatness from many angles, it was appropriate to simply <em>wait</em> for the LORD — for His guidance, His word, His deliverance — looking to Him as <strong>our help and shield</strong>. Earlier the psalmist called God’s people to rejoice because of God’s character and might. Now he calls us to praise God because of our blessed experience of trusting in <strong>His holy name</strong>.” (David Guzik on Ps. 33) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>Be patient for God’s timing and put your hope in Him</u>. The psalmist proclaimed: “<em>Our soul waits for the LORD</em>; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:20). The Psalms contain many similar exhortations for believers to be patient and put their hope in God: “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? <em>My hope is in You</em>.” (Ps. 39:7). “My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for <em>my hope is from Him</em>.” (Ps. 62:5). “A Psalm of David. <em>My soul waits in silence for God alone</em>; from Him comes my salvation.” (Ps. 62:1). “I wait for the LORD, <em>my soul waits</em>, and I wait for His word.” (Ps. 130:5). “<em>I hope for Your salvation</em>, LORD, and do Your commandments . . . <em>I hope for Your salvation</em>, LORD, and do Your commandments.” (Ps. 119:81, 166). Are you willing to wait for God’s timing?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers you the hope of eternal joy in heaven</u>. When you feel under attack, you can find many kinds of hope through Jesus. “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a <em>hope</em> both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). Most importantly, He promises to resurrect you and give you eternal joy in heaven (1 Thess. 4:13-17; Rev. 20:4-6). “Paul described the joy of heaven as something beyond what any have seen or experienced (1 Cor. 2:9). Are you sharing the good news with others?</p></li>
