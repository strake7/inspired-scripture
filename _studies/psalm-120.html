<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 120 is the first of a series of psalms called the Songs of Ascents or “<em>Shir Hama'a lot</em>” (Ps. 120–134). “These were sung by the pilgrims as they were coming to Jerusalem on these glorious feast days, coming to worship the Lord.” (Chuck Smith on Ps. 120-134)<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> These included Passover, “<em>Shavuot</em>”, and Tabernacles “<em>Sukkot</em>” (Ex. 23:14-17; 34:23-24; Dt. 16:16).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Ascending from lower elevations, the people were “going ‘up’ to Jerusalem. But they are also called Psalms of Ascent because the psalms themselves have an upward motion. They begin with the believer crying out to God in trouble far away from Jerusalem, and they end with believers offering up praise to God in his temple courts. So these are travel songs – full of beautiful imagery, meaningful expression and divine wisdom for the journey.” (Ray Fowler on Ps. 120-134).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Here, while attempting to worship in Jerusalem, enemies slandered the psalmist and, most likely, other pilgrims seeking to worship God. When you are slandered for doing God’s will, Psalm 120 reveals seven lessons for turning to Him. These include: (1) the faith to cry out to Him, (2) grateful praise, (3) prayer, (4) trust, (5) separation, (6) hope, and (7) peace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the pain from being slandered caused the psalmist to feel great distress. But he showed his faith and trust in God by crying out to Him for help. When you are slandered, crying out to God instead of taking matters into your own hands also shows your faith and trust in Him. <u>Second</u>, after a later victory, the psalmist had the faith to recognize God’s providence and praised Him for answering his prayers. When you are slandered, you can also show your faith, trust, and gratitude by praising God. <u>Third</u>, before God answered his prayers, the psalmist cried out for deliverance from his slanderers. When you are slandered, God also wants you to turn to Him and pray for deliverance. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist did not seek revenge or fight back when he was slandered. Instead, he trusted in God to be just and fair in righting the wrongs against His people. When you are slandered, you should also never seek vengeance. Instead, trust in God’s perfect justice. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist lamented that he had journeyed from a faraway pagan land only to find himself again surrounded by evil. When evil abounds, God wants you to separate yourself from it and stay holy for His use. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist also lamented that the pain he now felt as a pilgrim was similar to the pain he felt while living in a far off pagan land. He longed to be in God’s presence and feel His peace. In the face of slander, God wants you to place your hope in Him and seek His peace. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist further lamented that his enemies sought conflict while he sought peace. When others attack you, God also wants you to seek His peace.</p>
<h2 id="faith-when-you-are-slandered-cry-out-to-god-with-faith.-ps.-1201a."><strong>1. <u>Faith: When You Are Slandered, Cry Out To God With Faith</u>. Ps. 120:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Show your faith by crying out to God during a trial</u>. Possibly when an enemy slandered the Jewish pilgrims headed to Jerusalem, the psalmist cried out for God’s help. “<em>A Song of Ascents. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> I cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in my trouble, …</em>.” (Ps. 120:1a). Although the exact “trouble” is not identified, “[s]ome suppose it to be the Captivity itself, others the opposition offered by the Samaritans, Ammonites, and others to the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4.htm"><u>Ezra 4, 5</u></a>.) and restoration of the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm"><u>Nehemiah 2:19, 20</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-1.htm"><u>Nehemiah 4:1-23</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-2.htm"><u>Nehemiah 6:2-14</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 120:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Just as the psalmist did, cry out to God when you are attacked<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God when you are in need</u>. God promises to answer your prayers when you call upon Him in faith: “<em>Call to Me and I will answer you</em>, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.” (Jer. 33:3). David and other psalmists began many of their psalms with similar requests for God to hear their cries for help:  “A Psalm of David. <sup>1</sup> <em>Answer me</em> when I call, God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; be gracious to me and <em>hear my prayer</em>.”  (Ps. 4:1). “I have called upon You, for You will answer me, God; <em>incline Your ear to me, hear my speech</em>.” (Ps. 17:6). “<em>Hear, LORD</em>, when I cry with my voice, and be gracious to me and answer me.”  (Ps. 27:7). “<em>Incline Your ear to me</em>, rescue me quickly; be a rock of strength for me, a stronghold to save me.” (Ps. 31:2). “<em>Listen to my prayer</em>, God; and do not hide Yourself from my pleading.” (Ps. 55:1). “A Psalm of David. <em>Hear my cry</em>, God; give Your attention to my prayer.” (Ps. 61:1; 142:6).  “<em>Incline Your ear, Lord, and answer me;</em>” (Ps. 86:1). “Let my prayer come before You; <em>incline Your ear to my cry</em>!” (Ps. 88:2). “My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who devour, among sons of mankind whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword.” (Ps. 57:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God hears the cries of those made righteous through faith in Jesus</u>. Unrepentant sin can hinder your prayers (1 Pet. 3:7; Jo. 9:31; Prov. 15:29). But when you confess your sins and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He makes you righteous so that your prayers can be clearly heard. “Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. A prayer of a righteous person, when it is brought about, can accomplish much.” (Jam. 5:16). If you fail to repent, God can sometimes use trials to bring you to repentance. After you repent, your prayers can be clearly received. “And I will bring the third part through the fire, refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested. <em>They will call on My name, and I will answer them</em>; I will say, ‘They are My people,’ And they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’” (Zech. 13:9).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="praise-when-you-are-slandered-turn-to-god-and-praise-him.-ps.-1201b."><strong>2. <u>Praise: When You Are Slandered, Turn to God and Praise Him</u>. Ps. 120:1b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God and show gratitude when He answers your prayers</u>. The Jews’ enemies were at some point thwarted in their actions. The psalmist then had the faith to see God’s hand in their deliverance. “<em>…, and He answered me</em>.” (Ps. 120:1b). When God answers your prayers, you can show your gratitude by thanking him and sharing your testimony.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David also had the faith to praise God for answering his prayers</u>.  As a sign of his faith, David also praised God in advance for answering his prayer and protecting him: “I was crying out to the LORD with my voice, and <em>He answered me</em> from His holy mountain.” (Ps. 3:4). “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; <em>He heard my voice from His temple</em>, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears.” (Ps. 18:6).  “For I wait for You, LORD; <em>You will answer</em>, Lord my God.”  (Ps. 38:15). </p></li>

<p>Praise God and share your testimony when He answers your prayers<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Thank God when He answers your prayers</u>. David also thanked God for answering his prayers: “In my distress I called upon the LORD, yes, <em>I called out to my God; and from His temple He heard my voice</em>, and my cry for help came into His ears.” (2 Sam. 22:7). “But know that the LORD has set apart the godly person for Himself; <em>the LORD hears</em> when I call to Him.”  (Ps. 4:3).  “Leave me, all you who practice injustice, for <em>the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping</em>.”  (Ps. 6:8).  “In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God for help; <em>He heard my voice</em> from His temple, and my cry for help before Him came into His ears.”  (Ps. 18:6).  “Blessed be the LORD, because <em>He has heard the sound of my pleading</em>.”  (Ps. 28:6). Thus, David always praised God:  “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His faithfulness is everlasting.”  (1 Chr. 16:34). If you fail to make a habit of thanking Him, you may take Him for granted.  Even in times when he was jailed and persecuted, Paul worshiped God and gave thanks: “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;” (Eph. 5:20). Are you regularly thanking God for answering your prayers?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God answers your prayers because He loves you</u>. Through history, God has shown Himself to be faithful to respond to the cries of His people when they were oppressed.  For example, He heard the cries of His people in Egypt (Ex. 3:7). He also repeatedly responded to their cries of oppression inside of the Promised Land (Jdgs. 2:18).  “Many times He would deliver them; they, however, were rebellious in their counsel, and so sank down in their iniquity.  Nevertheless He looked upon their distress when He heard their cry; and He remembered His covenant for their sake, and relented according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.”  (Ps. 106:43-45).  This same love caused Jesus to come to Earth and be sacrificed for our sins  (Jo. 3:16). Because He loves you and is faithful, God will also never leave you nor forsake you (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5).</p></li>

<h2 id="prayer-when-you-are-slandered-pray-for-gods-deliverance.-ps.-1202."><strong>3. <u>Prayer: When You Are Slandered, Pray For God’s Deliverance</u>. Ps. 120:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When you are slandered, turn to God for your deliverance</u>. Instead of trying to take matters into his own hands, the psalmist prayed for God to deliver him from the enemy’s slander. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Rescue my soul, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue</em>.” (Ps. 120:2). God rescues many from slander. “God can restrain them, and prevent the ill influence of them when he pleases, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>. Such were the lips and tongues of Doeg the Edomite, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-2.htm">Psalm 52:2</a>, and of Saul’s courtiers, who insinuated to him that David sought his hurt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-9.htm">1 Samuel 24:9</a>; and of the Scribes and Pharisees, that flattered Christ to his face, and reproached him to the people; and of Judas, that betrayed him with ‘Hail, maser’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>; and of the false witnesses suborned against him; and of false teachers, deceitful workers, that lie in wait to deceive, and, by their good words and fair speeches, do deceive the hearts of the simple; and of antichrist and his followers, who, as they are given up to believe a lie, speak lies in hypocrisy; and of Satan the father of lies, and who is the old serpent, the devil, that deceives the whole world: and to be delivered from the bad effects of such lips and tongues is very desirable.” (John Gill on Ps. 120:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Samaritans also slandered the Jews to stop the Temple rebuilding</u>. Psalm 120 does not identify its context. But it matches the lies that the Samaritans used against Ezra when he led the Jews in rebuilding the Temple. In 538 B.C., King Cyrus I issued an edict to free the Jews and allow them to rebuild the Temple. But when King Ahasuerus aka Xerxes I (circa 486 – 464 B.C.), became King of Persia, the Samaritans sought to reverse the edict. King Ahasuerus married Esther (Esther 8:7). The Samaritans may have learned of Haman’s plot against the Jews and sought to convince King Ahasuerus that the Jews who returned to Jerusalem were a threat who needed to be killed as well: “ . . . therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.” (Esther 3:6). To convince King Ahasuerus, they defamed the Jews: “<em><sup> </sup></em>[I]n the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.” (Ezra 4:6). The opponents of the Temple called the Jewish-controlled Jerusalem a “rebellious and evil city” (Ezra 4:12).  Because Persia was weakened through ongoing rebellions, this charge was effective in turning the king against them.  Jewish leaders like Jehoiakim (2 Kgs. 24:1, 20) and Zedekiah (2 Chr. 36:13) had rebelled against Babylonian rule. Thus, King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem in 586 B.C. (Ezra 4:15). Northern Israel also rebelled against the Assyrians in 701 B.C. (2 Kgs. 18:7).  But there was no evidence of the Jews ever rebelling against the Persian empire because the Persian tolerated the Jews’ worship of Yahweh.  The Temple opponents also alleged that the Jews would “not pay tribute, custom or toll” (Ezra 4:13) if the Jews finished their rebuilding plans.  But there was also again no evidence to support this false charge.   In Hebrew, the word “accusation” can also be translated as Satan, our accuser (1 Chr. 21:1; Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1). Satan used the Samaritans and Haman to make false accusations against the Jews. If given the chance, Satan will also use lies and slander against you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Satan will make accusations against you as well</u>. Satan will also incite accusations against you when you step out in faith to serve Jesus. He makes accusations against believers “day and night.” But you can have faith that your accuser will eventually be thrown down into the lake of fire: “Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, ‘Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.”’ (Rev. 12:10; Job 1:6; Zech. 3:1). If you are under Satan’s attack for your past sins, he knows that you are being effective. You can plead guilty to all the charges against you knowing that Jesus has paid the penalty for your sins. If you feel tempted to make accusations against your brothers and sisters in Christ, don’t let Satan use you to discourage another fellow sinner from stepping out to serve Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Show self-restraint when you are attacked</u>. It would have been tempting for the Jews to lash out at the Samaritans for making accusations against them. When you are attacked, Jesus urges you to show restraint: “But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.” (Matt. 5:39; Lk. 6:29). “not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9). “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. . . Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.” (Ro. 12:14, 17). When others hurt you or make accusations against you, do you restrain your urge to strike back?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for God’s deliverance when others slander you</u>. David was frequently the victim of slander. Instead of taking matters into his own hands, he prayed to God for deliverance. “Let the lying lips be speechless, which speak arrogantly against the righteous with pride and contempt.” (Ps. 31:8). While under attack in the wilderness, David frequently cried out to God for deliverance: “<sup>1</sup> Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, for my soul takes refuge in You; and in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge until destruction passes by. <sup>2 </sup>I will cry to God Most High, to God who accomplishes all things for me. <sup>3 </sup>He will send from heaven and save me; He reproaches him who tramples upon me. Selah. God will send forth His lovingkindness and His truth. <sup>4 </sup>My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.” (Ps. 57:1-4). As part of the model prayer, Jesus also urges every believer to pray for deliverance from evil. “And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.’” (Matt. 6:13). “I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.” (Jo. 17:15). “We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.” (1 Jo. 5:19). Satan, the accuser of the brethren, is constantly watching you to make charges against you. Are you turning to Jesus each day to seek deliverance for yourself and others when you are attacked?</p></li>

<h2 id="trust-when-you-are-slandered-trust-in-gods-perfect-justice.-ps.-1203-4."><strong>4. <u>Trust: When You Are Slandered, Trust in God’s Perfect Justice</u>. Ps. 120:3-4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who slander and defame others will reap what they sow</u>. Instead of seeking vengeance against those who slandered him, the psalmist prophetically stated God’s judgment against them. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>What will He give to you, and what more will He do to you, you deceitful tongue? <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Sharp arrows of the warrior, with the burning coals of the broom tree!</em>” (Ps. 120:3-4). In other words, they would reap the pain that they had sown.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God promises to judge unrepentant sinners who slander others</u>. The psalmist called a “<em>deceitful tongue</em>” the <em>“sharp arrows of the warrior</em>.” (Ps. 120:3-4). The prophet Jeremiah and Solomon both called the deceitful tongue as deadly as an arrow. “Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit; with his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, but inwardly he sets an ambush for him.” (Jer. 9:8a). “Like a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow is a person who gives false testimony against his neighbor.” (Prov. 25:18). James went a step further and called a deceitful tongue as being as deadly as a fire. “And the tongue is a fire, the very world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our body’s parts as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.” (Jam. 3:6). For those who fail to repent, they will one day receive “<em>burning coals of the broom tree!</em>” (Ps. 120:4). This implied an unspeakably hot fire. “<em>With coals of juniper</em> [KJV translation]- …The idea here is, that coals made from that would be intensely hot, and would cause severer pain than if made from other wood. The word refers to a species of broom or shrub growing in the deserts of Arabia, with yellowish flowers and a bitter root.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 120:4).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Take God’s warnings about slander seriously</u>. God warns believers not to slander others: “<em>You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people</em>; and you are not to jeopardize the life of your neighbor. I am the LORD.” (Lev. 19:16; Ex. 23:7) “‘You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another.’” (Lev. 19:11; Ex. 23:1-2). Lying is so offensive to God that it violates the Ninth Commandment (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). Lies are also one of the sins that God “hates.” “There are six things which the Lord hates, yes, seven which are an abomination to Him: . . . <em>a lying tongue</em>, and . . . a <em>false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers</em>.” (Prov. 6:16-19). “Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who deal faithfully are His delight.” (Prov. 22:22). Satan is the father of all liars. When you lie, you are under his influence: “You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father . . . Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Jo. 8:44). Thus, no matter what the reason, you should never resort to lies or slander. Small lies can lead to more damaging ones. Ultimately, they grow into judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Lies and deceit lead to even worse sins</u>. David warned his enemies that their evil would only grow if they failed to repent (Ps. 7:14). God’s warnings about small, unchecked sins leading to even worse sins and consequences is repeated throughout the Bible: “You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble; My breath will consume you like a fire.” (Is. 33:11). “Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:15). If there is any small sin in your life, don’t let it grow into a worse sin. Instead, repent of it and turn back to walking with God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Unrepentant sinners will reap what they sow</u>. David also warned his enemies that they could bear the consequences of their actions (Ps. 7:15-16). The warning that a person reaps what he or she sows is also repeated throughout the Bible: “You have plowed wickedness, you have harvested injustice, you have eaten the fruit of lies.” (Hos. 10:13<sup>a</sup>). “One who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will perish.” (Prov. 22:8). “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap.” (Gal. 6:7). But God’s timing is not always our timing. Thus, you should never interpret the absence of an immediate consequence for a sin to assume that God does not care. God frequently delays punishment to give sinners the chance to repent.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will return to judge those who reject His mercy and grace</u>. For those who reject Jesus’ mercy and grace, Jesus will judge them according to their deeds: “For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will then repay every man according to his deeds.” (Matt. 16:27). “Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.” (Rev. 22:12). “I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.” (Rev. 2:23b). Thus, nonbelievers should not treat the promise of Jesus’ justice with indifference.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear God by hating all forms of lies</u>. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of all wisdom. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10; Ps. 111:10). Fearing God includes turning away from evil: “And to mankind He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding.”’ (Job 28:28). If you want to be wise, avoid all lies.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you are attacked, trust God to right the wrongs against you</u>. It is part of our sinful human nature to fight back when you are attacked. But, like the psalmist, God wants you to leave vengeance to him: “Do not say, ‘I will repay evil’; wait for the LORD, and He will save you.” (Prov. 20:22). When you have faith in Jesus, you have an advocate who responds on your behalf to rebut Satan’s accusations: “My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. <em>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father</em>, Jesus Christ the righteous;” (1 Jo. 2:1). Jesus has also appointed the Holy Spirit to help you in your trials: “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;” (Jo. 14:16). When you face accusations against you, do you pray for Jesus and the Spirit to intercede on your behalf?</p></li>

<h2 id="separation-when-evil-abounds-separate-yourself-and-stay-holy.-ps.-1205."><strong>5. <u>Separation: When Evil Abounds, Separate Yourself and Stay Holy</u>. Ps. 120:5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Avoid conforming to the evil practices in the world around you</u>. Using images of distant pagan lands, the psalmist lamented that he had been forced to live far from the Promised Land where people rejected God’s Word.  He sadly returned as a pilgrim only to encounter more evil people. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Woe to me, for I reside in Meshech, for I have settled among the tents of Kedar!</em>” (Ps. 120:5). The name Meshech first appears as a son of Japheth (Gen. 10:2; 1 Chr. 1:5). The name Kedar first appears as a son of Ishmael (Gen. 25:13). “Meshech, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a> as a son of Japheth, was a barbarous people living between the Black Sea and the Caspian [Russia], probably the Moschi of Herodotus (iii. 94), and Mushki of the Assyrian inscriptions: <em>Kedar</em>, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a> as the second son of Ishmael, was one of the wild tribes which roamed through the Arabian desert, “whose hand was against every man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>). Obviously the Psalmist cannot mean to describe himself as actually living among peoples so remote from one another, but applies these typical names of barbarian tribes to his own compatriots, as we might speak of Turks and Tartars.” (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ps. 120:5).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> “It could also be that by choosing places so far apart the psalmist was accounting for remote places Israelites lived, and therefore difficulties that the pilgrims had to overcome (a theme in the collection).” (Allen Ross on Ps. 120:5).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Live in the world but not of the world</u>. Jesus warns that worldly people will reject you if you live your life in obedience to Him and His Word. “If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.” (Jo. 15:19). “I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.” (Jo. 17:14). For similar reasons, the psalmist refused to adopt the ways of the pagan people where he had been forced to live during captivity. “He was forced to live at a distance from the ordinances of God. While he was in banishment, he looked upon himself as a sojourner, never at home but when he was near God's altars; and he cries out, ‘<em>Woe is me</em> that my sojourning is prolonged, that I cannot get home to my resting-place, but am still kept at a distance!’ So some read it. Note, A good man cannot think himself at home while he is banished from God’s ordinances and has not them within reach.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 120:5).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Because you are forced to live in a fallen world, pray for God to renew your mind each day for His use (Ro. 12:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The pagan nations will one day bow before Jesus</u>. In the future, all the pagan nations will confess Jesus as Lord (Phil. 2:10). The psalmist’s references to two far off pagan lands may be connected to this end times event. “In view of the new exodus and return from exile context of the Psalter’s Book 5, the references to Meshech and Kedar in eschatological prophecies are also relevant. Kedar is a place from which Yahweh will be praised in Isa 42:11, and its flocks will be gathered to God’s triumphant people in Isa 60:7 with the wealth of the nations in 60:5 and 60:11. Meshech, meanwhile, has Gog of the land of Magog for chief prince in Ezek 38:2-3 and 39:1. The psalmist, then, speaks of himself as though he has been struck in the places that will one day glorify the God of Israel. In view of the eschatological rebellion by Gog of Magog, chief prince of Meshech in Ezek 38-39 (cf. Rev 20:7-10), it makes sense that the psalmist would describe himself dwelling among those who hate shalom in Ps. 120:6.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 120:5)<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="hope-in-the-face-of-slander-place-your-hope-in-god-for-peace.-ps.-1206."><strong>6. <u>Hope: In the Face of Slander, Place Your Hope in God for Peace</u>. Ps. 120:6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When evil abounds, keep your hope on God</u>. The conflict that the psalmist now felt was similar to his prior time living in a pagan land with people who were hostile to Yahweh. All the psalmist could do was to desire to be in God’s holy presence where he could worship and feel God’s peace. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Too long has my soul had its dwelling with those who hate peace</em>.” (Ps. 120:6). “The psalmist ached because he lived among the ungodly and was distant from Israel and its people. He longed for God’s <em>shalom</em> (<strong>peace</strong>); his enemies, who had lying lips, hated God’s <em>shalom</em>. . .This makes <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+120&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 120</a> a fitting start to the Songs of Ascents. As the pilgrim journey to Jerusalem began, the author was mindful of the weariness endured living apart from the supportive community of God’s people. The psalmist <em>needed</em> this trip to Jerusalem at feast time and <em>needed</em> the larger community of the people of God.” (David Guzik on Ps. 120:6) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Find hope in Jesus’ peace when the world hates you</u>. When the world hates you, Jesus invites you to find peace by turning to Him. “Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me … Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:1, 27). “These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When a conflict persists, place your hope in Jesus</u>. There were many times when the psalmists had no answer to their conflicts. All they could do was place their hope in God. “And now, Lord, for what do I wait? <em>My hope is in You</em>.” (Ps. 39:7). “For <em>You are my hope;</em> Lord GOD, You are my confidence from my youth.” (Ps. 71:5). “For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and <em>a hope</em>.”’ (Jer. 29:11). When your adversary refuses to reconcile, Jesus wants you to place your hope in Him. He will then encourage you. “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to <em>a living hope</em> through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,” (1 Pet. 1:3). “This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a <em>hope</em> both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil,” (Heb. 6:19). “For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and <em>the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope</em>.” (Ro. 15:4).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peace-when-others-attack-you-pray-for-gods-peace.-ps.-1207."><strong>7. <u>Peace: When Others Attack You, Pray For God’s Peace</u>. Ps. 120:7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>When others seek conflict, seek God’s peace</u>. The psalmist lamented that he tried to be at peace with his attackers. But they only sought conflict. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war</em>.” (Ps. 120:7). “When the Jews returned from the Captivity and began to build the temple, the Samaritans offered to join with them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>). But the Samaritan offer was, perhaps, insincere. At any rate, when it was refused, they became the most bitter opponents of the Jews.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 120:7).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Enemies fought back after the Jews refused to allow other faiths in the Temple</u>.  When the Jews started the Temple rebuilding process, local Samaritans initially sought to ensure that the future Temple would include both pagan and Jewish worship. They alleged that they had been sacrificing to Yahweh since the “since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria (circa 681 to 669 B.C.), who brought us up here.”  (Ezra 4:1-3).  They were captured servants from other nations whom the Assyrians brought to Northern Israel after King Sargon II deported most of the ten northern tribes (2 Kgs. 17:34-41).   These foreign exiles intermarried with the Jews who remained in Northern Israel.  Together, they formed a hybrid religion that worshiped both Yahweh and idols.  If the returning Jews had accepted their help, these Samaritans would have demanded the right to include pagan worship in the Temple along with Yahweh worship.  In modern terms, they would be celebrated for advocating diversity of worship.  The Samaritans would have viewed the returning Jewish pilgrims as extremists who threatened their inclusive religious practices.  They used deception to advance their agenda.  The returning Jews said no to their help while still trying to live at peace.  The Samaritans then responded with conflict.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews later rejected the peace that Jesus offered</u>. Jesus also faced Jews who chose conflict and persecution over the peace that He offered. “Jesus was a man of peace; … When he was risen from the dead, and made his first appearance to his disciples, he said unto them, ‘Peace be unto you’: he is the peace-maker: the Holy Ghost is the peace-maker: his gospel is the gospel of peace; it contains the peace of God which passeth all understanding. ‘I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.’ The bulk of the Jewish nation abhorred Christ, they were for putting him to death; . . .” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 120:7).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> After His death, the Jews then persecuted Jesus’ followers.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When others seek conflict, pray for God’s peace to prevail.</u> Another psalmist faced a similar conflict. A different enemy had rejected his attempt to live in peace. All he could do was turn to God in prayer. “In return for my love they act as my accusers; but I am in prayer.” (Ps. 109:4). God does not want you to compromise anything that He declares in His Word. In every other context, He will bless those who pursue peace and unity with their brothers and sisters in faith: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (Ps. 133:1(b)). “The beginning of strife is like letting out water, so abandon the quarrel before it breaks out.” (Prov. 17:14). “Keeping away from strife is an honor for a man, . . .” (Prov. 20:3). “If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.” (Ro. 12:18). “So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.” (Ro. 14:19). When others hurt you or try to take things belonging to you, do you seek peace or retribution and conflict?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Use kindness and love to win over your enemies</u>. Even when you face a conflict that cannot be easily resolved, you can still show God’s love to your enemies: “If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.” (Prov. 25:21-22; Ro. 12:20). “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” (Ro. 12:21). “But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” (Matt. 5:44; Lk. 6:28, 35). Thus, even when a conflict persists, love is critical to a future reconciliation.</p></li>

<p>Without compromising God’s Word, seek to be at peace with others<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Love covers many sins</u>. God’s love can also cover many sins. “Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Pet. 4:8). Job, for example, made continuous sacrifices for his children in case they sinned (Job 1:5). Showing love to your enemies is something that God will reward you for in His timing.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Put the needs of others before your needs</u>. If the conflict does not involve compromising God’s Word, God wants you to put the needs of others first: “Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.” (1 Cor. 10:24). “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.” (Phil. 2:3-4; Matt. 5:40). Do you put your own needs in front of others?</p></li>
