<p><strong>1. <u>Faithfulness: Praise God Because He is Faithful to Keep His Promises</u>. Ps. 30:1.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for delivering him from his enemies and building his house</u>. After his palace was completed, David dedicated the building to God. He praised God for protecting him from the many times that his enemies tried to kill him: “<em>A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House. A Psalm of David. <sup>1</sup> I will exalt You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for You have lifted me up, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.”</em> (Ps. 30:1). David’s praise should be understood as a praise both for God’s faithfulness in providing for him a palace to rule over Israel and also as a sign of God’s Covenant for an eternal dynasty.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God built the physical house of David</u>. The Jews were expected to dedicate their homes to God to give Him the credit: “The officers also shall speak to the people, saying, ‘Who is the man that has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it.” (Dt. 20:5). As an example of this, Nehemiah dedicated the rebuilt walls of Jerusalem to God after enemies tried to stop them (Neh. 12:27). David saw God’s hand in the building of his palace after a king in Lebanon submitted to him and supplied the needed materials and workers. David also showed himself to be God’s servant by then giving Him the credit: “<sup>11 </sup>Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees and carpenters and stonemasons; and they built a house for David. <sup>12 </sup>And David realized that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.” (2 Sam. 5:11-12; 1 Chr. 14:1-2). God previously allocated the city of Tyre in Southern Lebanon as part of the inheritance of the tribe of Asher and as the northern border of the Promised Land (Josh. 19:29). This was evidence of God’s faithfulness. David showed himself as a man of God by refraining from taking the credit for his victories and the building of his grand palace. “In this, we see that King David knew three things that made his reign great. Every godly leader should know these three things well. · <em>David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel</em>: David knew that God called him and established him over Israel. · <em>He had exalted His kingdom</em>: David knew that the kingdom belonged to God – it was <em>His kingdom</em>. · <em>For the sake of His people Israel</em>: David knew God wanted to use him as a channel to bless His people. It was not for David’s sake that he was lifted up, but for the <em>sake of His people Israel</em>. For You have lifted me up: This explains the core reason for David’s praise. He knew that his security and status were the work of God. It wasn’t as if God did it all as David sat passively; he was a man of energy and action. Nevertheless, it was God’s work far more than his own.” (David Guzik on Ps. 30) (italics original).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God also built the “house of David” leading to the King of Kings</u>. David wanted to build a house for God. But God did not let him do so because of the blood on his hands (2 Sam. 7:4-7; 1 Chron. 17:3-6). Nevertheless, God promised to create an eternal kingdom through David’s descendants: ‘“<sup>16 </sup><em>Your house</em> and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever’.” (2 Sam. 7:16). ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations.’ Selah.” (Ps. 89:4). “So I will establish his descendants forever and his throne as the days of heaven.” (Ps. 89:29). “He gives great deliverance to His king, and shows lovingkindness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” (Ps. 18:50). “I also shall make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 89:27). “For thus says the LORD, ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;”’ (Jer. 33:17). “For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:6-7). “A throne will even be established in lovingkindness, and a judge will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David; moreover, he will seek justice and be prompt in righteousness.” (Is. 16:5). “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely; and this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our righteousness.’”’ (Jer. 23:5-6). Jesus was born into the line of David (Matt. 1:1). He came to fulfill God’s covenant with David as the eternal King of Kings: “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.’” (Rev. 19:16). You may declare Jesus to be your Lord. Yet, is He Lord over every aspect of your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Despite David’s unfaithfulness, God remained faithful</u>. David could not boast that he had a right to be king. His many sins should have disqualified him from being God’s anointed king (Is. 1:15; Jo. 9:31). Yet, out of grace, God was faithful to keep His Covenant with David: “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He will also keep His many promises to you. This is true even when you are unfaithful to Him: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass.” (1 Thess. 5:24). Have you given thanks for His faithfulness to you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God blesses you for His glory and not your own</u>. David showed himself to be a Spirit-led king by giving God the credit for his blessings and by realizing that His blessings were not meant to glorify David (Ps. 30:1; 2 Sam. 5:12). Thus, he frequently offered God songs of thanksgiving: “. . . To you I shall offer a <em>sacrifice of thanksgiving</em>, and call upon the name of the Lord, I shall pay my vows to the Lord.” (Ps. 116:1, 17-18). “ . . . I will render <em>thank offerings</em> to You. For you have delivered my soul from death.” (Ps. 56:12-13; 116:8). “. . . Let them also offer <em>sacrifices of thanksgiving</em>, and tell of His works with joyful singing.” (Ps. 107:1, 2, 22). “in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;” (Eph. 5:20). Have you given thanks for God’s blessings? Are you also giving Him the credit for your blessings?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <u>Healing: Praise God Because He Can Heal You From Your Illnesses</u>. Ps. 30:2.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for healing him</u>. David then gave thanks because God healed him from one of the infirmities that plagued him: “<sup>2 </sup><em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me</em>.” (Ps. 30:2). God also deserves your praise when He heals you.</p></li>

<p>Image credit<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God can restore the health of a faithful believer</u>. Many believers don’t know what the Bible says about healing. Through Moses, God promised to pour out His blessings on those who live in faith-led obedience (Dt. 28:1-2). This can include His promise to withhold diseases and poor health: “And He said, ‘If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for <em>I, the LORD, am your healer.</em>’” (Ex. 15:26; Dt. 7:15). ‘“See now that I, I am He, and there is no god besides Me; it is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded <em>and it is I who heal</em>, and there is no one who can deliver from My hand.”’ (Dt. 32:39). “ . . . <em>the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted</em>.” (Is. 30:26). “For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, and <em>His hands also heal</em>.” (Job 5:8). “<em>He heals</em> the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” (Ps. 147:3). “He sent His word <em>and healed them</em>, and delivered them from their destructions.” (Ps. 107:20). Hezekiah later cried out to God when he was facing certain death. God answered his prayers by healing him and by adding 15 years to his life (2 Kgs. 20:1-7). If you are in need of healing, are you crying out to God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>All things are possible with God when you have faith</u>. When you have faith, there is no miracle that is too big for God: “Is anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14(a)). “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” (Jer. 32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). “‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26(b); Mk. 10:27(b); Lk. 1:37). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). God also wants you to turn to Him in faith when your health issues seem impossible. His miracles happen every day.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You cannot earn God’s healing through your works</u>. By Jesus’ stripes you can also be healed from any infirmity: “But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, <em>and by His scourging we are healed</em>.” (Is. 53:5; 1 Pet. 2:24). He is so powerful that He healed a leper merely with His touch or His command: “Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, ‘I am willing; be cleansed.’ And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” (Matt. 8:3). Although your faith-led obedience can bring His blessing of healing, you cannot earn His healings through your works. This would undermine Jesus’ sacrifice. God illustrated this principle in the Old Testament through His healing of the Syrian leper Naaman. Naaman wanted to earn his healing through a dramatic test of his strength in the raging mountainous rivers in Syria. He did not want to dunk himself seven times in the calm Jordan River (2 Kgs. 5:9-12). God never wants you to serve Him with the wrong motives. Yet, He also wants you to know that His offer to bless and restore your health is real. Serve Him in obedience and let Him bless you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God when you need deliverance from an illness or disease</u>. Some think that a true person of faith should stoically accept an illness. But David cried out for God when he needed healing: “O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and <em>You healed me</em>.” (Ps. 30:2). “Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for <em>my bones are dismayed</em>.” (Ps. 6:2). “There is no healthy part in my flesh because of Your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.” (Ps. 38:3). “As for me, I said, ‘O LORD, be gracious to me; <em>heal my soul</em>, for I have sinned against You.”’ (Ps. 41:4). Moses also cried out for God to heal his sister Miriam from her leprosy: “Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, ‘O God, heal her, I pray!”’ (Nu. 12:13). Hezekiah was a man of faith because he cried out to God for divine healing (2 Kgs. 20:1-7). Thus, God welcomes your prayers to Him for healing. It is a sign of your faith in Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God when He delivers you from a health battle</u>. Whenever God answered his prayers, David also praised God for His faithfulness. “I cried to Him with my mouth, and He was exalted with my tongue.” (Ps. 66:17). “You are my God, and I give thanks to You; You are my God, I exalt You.” (Ps. 118:28). “A Psalm of Praise, of David. I will exalt You, my God, the King, and I will bless Your name forever and ever.” (Ps. 145:1). Matthew Henry asked in relation to this verse: “God’s saints in heaven sing to him; why should not those on earth do the same?” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 30).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. <u>Salvation: Praise God For Offering A Path to Salvation Through Jesus</u>. Ps. 30:3.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for saving his life and soul</u>. In addition to granting him an unearned eternal dynasty and the restoration of his health, God also saved David from eternal death: “<sup>3 </sup><em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit</em>.” (Ps. 30:3). The Jews had an unclear understanding of the afterlife. Nevertheless, David knew that God also saved his soul from a dark place.</p></li>
<li><p><u>David repeatedly praised God for delivering him from Sheol</u>. The Psalms contain many similar praises where David praised God for saving his soul from Sheol: “Be gracious to me, LORD; see my oppression from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,” (Ps. 9:13). “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 86:13). “For You have saved my soul from death, indeed my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God In the light of the living.” (Ps. 56:13). Jesus later provided a way for all to be delivered from death and find eternal life with Him in heaven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus died on the cross so that everyone might find eternal life</u>. Out of love, God planned before time began to send Jesus to die on the cross to allow all who believe to have eternal life: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (John 3:16). “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’” (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). Through Jesus, you can “obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,” (1 Pet. 1:4). “And [Jesus] said to him, ‘Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”’ (Lk. 23:43). Paul “was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.” (2 Cor. 12:4). “but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,” (2 Tim. 1:10). “To the one who overcomes, I will grant to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.’” (Rev. 2:7b). “The one who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.” (Rev. 21:7). Are you praising Jesus for your gift of eternal life?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <u>Holiness: Praise God Because His Holy Light Can Guide You</u>. Ps. 30:4.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His holiness</u>. David also called upon the angels who surrounded God to praise Him because His is holy: “<sup>4 </sup><em>Sing praise to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you His godly ones, and praise the mention of His holiness</em>.” (Ps. 30:4). Many similar praises exist in the Psalms: “Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His footstool; Holy is He.” (Ps. 99:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ holiness guides you when you are in darkness</u>. God’s holiness includes a beauty that is unlike anything human eyes have seen: “The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the LORD has clothed and encircled Himself with strength. Indeed, the world is firmly established; it will not be moved.” (Ps. 93:1). Because He is holy, Jesus’ light can also guide you in darkness. When you feel trapped in darkness, He wants you to call Him to be your light: “In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.” (Jo. 1:4). “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). “I have come as Light into the world, so that no one who believes in Me will remain in darkness.” (Jo. 12:46). When you feel trapped in darkness, cry out to Jesus for His light.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy because God is holy.</u> Because God is holy, He expects His people to be holy as well: “For I am the LORD your God . . . be holy, for I am holy.” (Lev. 11:44). “Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.” (Lev. 19:2). “You are to be my holy people.” (Ex. 22:31). “for it is written: ‘Be holy, because I am holy.’” (1 Pet. 1:16). To become holy, Jesus began His public ministry with a call to repentance. “From that time Jesus began to preach and say, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”’ (Matt. 4:17). Jesus came “saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”’ (Mk. 1:15). His disciples also began their ministry with a call to repentance: “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”’ (Acts 2:38). If you say that you are without sin, the Bible says that the truth is not in you (1 Jo. 1:8). Yet, if you confess your sins, Jesus promises to forgive your sins: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). What sins do you need to repent of?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His Holy name</u>. The Jews praised God for His holy name: “<em>bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God forever and ever! May Your glorious name be blessed and exalted above all blessing and praise!</em>” (Neh. 9:5). The psalmist also blessed God’s holy name: “And blessed be His glorious name forever; and may the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.” (Ps. 72:19). “Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name; bring an offering and come into His courts.” (Ps. 96:8). “Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name give glory because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.” (Ps. 115:1). David also praised God’s holy name: “that Your name may be magnified forever,” (2 Sam. 7:26). Jesus also began the Lord’s prayer by declaring God’s name to be holy (Matt. 6:9) Do your prayers also include blessings and praises for God’s name?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. <u>Mercy: Praise God that He is Slow to Anger and Filled With Mercy</u>. Ps. 30:5-7.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for his mercy when he sinned</u>. Although God was briefly angered at one point when David boasted in his own strength, David gave thanks for God’s mercy: “<sup>5 </sup><em>For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime; weeping may last for the night, but a shout of joy comes in the morning</em>. <sup>6 </sup><em>Now as for me, I said in my prosperity, ‘I will never be moved.’ <sup>7 </sup><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, I was dismayed</em>.” (Ps. 30:5-7). There are consequences to sin. David’s pride briefly broke his fellowship with God. The pain of the broken fellowship always dismayed David. “You hide Your face, they are terrified; You take away their breath, they perish and return to their dust.” (Ps. 104:29). Thus, David was always quick to repent and give thanks that God was merciful and quick to forgive his many sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God is long suffering</u>. God revealed to Moses that He is slow to anger and quick to forgive: “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;” (Ex. 34:6). “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). He gives us mercy each time we repent and return to Him: “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’<span class="smallcaps">s</span> acts of mercy indeed do not end, for His compassions do not fail. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.” (Lam. 3:22-23). “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you.” (Is. 54:7). “Then you will say on that day, “I will give thanks to You, LORD; for although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.” (Is. 12:1). For these reasons, God deserves your praise for being slow to anger and quick to forgive.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God hears your prayers in your times of distress</u>. David further repeatedly gave thanks that his sins did not disqualify him from having his prayers heard: “Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer. I cry out with my voice to the LORD; with my voice I implore the LORD for compassion.” (Ps. 142:11). “For the music director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.” (Ps. 4:1). “I have called upon You, for You will answer me, God; incline Your ear to me, hear my speech.” (Ps. 17:6). If you are in distress, cry out to God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <u>Compassion: Praise God Because He is Compassionate and Loving</u>. Ps. 30:8-10.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for His compassion when he cried out to Him</u>. At a time when David feared death, God showed him compassion. Thus, David proclaimed God’s praises: “<sup>8 </sup><em>To You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I called, and to the Lord I pleaded for compassion: <sup>9 </sup>“What gain is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? <sup>10 </sup>“Hear, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and be gracious to me; <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, be my helper.”</em> (Ps. 30:8-10). David feared death because he lacked Jesus’ promises. With Jesus, there is no reason to fear death: “For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” (Phil. 1:21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise God for the comfort that He offers during your times of distress</u>. As a man of faith, David repeatedly turned to God whenever he was in need of comfort (Ps. 30:8). “May You increase my greatness and turn to comfort me.” (Ps. 71:21). “Show me a sign of good, that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because You, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.” (Ps. 86:17). You can also praise God because He is always ready to shower you with compassion and love: “Shout for joy, you heavens! And rejoice, you earth! Break forth into joyful shouting, mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people and will have compassion on His afflicted.” (Is. 49:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers you comfort when you turn to Him.</u> When you suffer, you can always turn to Jesus for comfort: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and <em>God of all comfort, who comforts us</em> in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.” (1 Cor. 1:3-4). He restores you when you feel sad: “But You, LORD, are a shield around me, My glory, and <em>the One who lifts my head</em>.” (Ps. 3:3). “A Psalm of David. I will exalt You, LORD, for <em>You have lifted me up</em>, and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.” (Ps. 30:1). “But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and <em>lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near</em>.” (Lk. 21:28). When others around you are in pain, Jesus also wants you to share with them the same “comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.” (1 Cor. 1:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God is your helper</u>. David called upon God to be his helper (Ps. 30:10). “Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the sustainer of my soul.” (Ps. 54:4). “The LORD is for me among those who help me; therefore I will look with satisfaction on those who hate me.” (Ps. 118:7). “Another compact, expressive, ever fitting prayer. It is suitable to hundreds of the cases of the Lord’s people; it is well becoming in the minister when he is going to preach, to the sufferer upon the bed of pain, to the toiler in the field of service, to the believer under temptation, to the man of God under adversity; when God helps, difficulties vanish.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 30).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. <u>Restoration: Praise God Because He Offers You a Joyful Restoration</u>. Ps. 30:11-12.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>David praised God for turning his tears into joy</u>. David concluded by praising God for restoring him from his feelings of pain and sorrow and turning his tears of grief into joy: “<em><sup>11 </sup>You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have untied my sackcloth and encircled me with joy, <sup>12 </sup>that my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent. <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, I will give thanks to You forever</em>.” (Ps. 30:11-12). Being “restored” might not sound appealing if you have only known sorrow and pain. But God’s restoration offers something far better. He will restore you to what you were meant to be and give you joy.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that Jesus will restore you and bring you joy</u>. With faith in Jesus, you can give thanks that He has “abolished death” (2 Tim. 1:10). In heaven, He will restore you and bring you joy: “Those who sow in tears shall harvest with joyful shouting.” (Ps. 126:5). “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.” (Is. 35:10). “And the redeemed of the LORD will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting, and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.” (Is. 51:11). “ . . . for you will have the LORD as an everlasting light, and the days of your mourning will be over.” (Is. 60:20). “and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.” (Rev. 21:4). Thus, if you are feeling sad, rejected or alone, you can give thanks that Jesus will restore you and bring you joy.</p></li>
<li><p><u>If you are lacking joy, cry out to Jesus to have it restored</u>. Thankfully, you don’t need to wait until heaven to find joy. Jesus offers you joy through the Holy Spirit: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, <em>joy</em>, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Gal. 5:22). “for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and <em>joy</em> in the Holy Spirit.” (Ro. 14:17). “Now may the God of hope fill you with all <em>joy</em> and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Ro. 15:13). If you are lacking joy, call out to Jesus for His joy: “Restore to me the <em>joy</em> of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.” (Ps. 51:12). When Jesus restores your joy, praise Him: “<em>I will rejoice and be jubilant in You</em>; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “But <em>rejoice</em>, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.” (Ps. 5:11). “<em>My lips will shout for joy</em> when I sing praises to You; and my soul, which You have redeemed.” (Ps. 71:23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for all His many blessings that He offers you</u>. As our example, David repeatedly praised God for his grace and blessings (Ps. 30:12). “I will praise You forever, because You have done it, and I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones.” (Ps. 52:9). “Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, LORD, for it is good.” (Ps. 54:6; 116:17). Because you have been blessed with so much through Jesus, He also deserves your ongoing praises.</p></li>
