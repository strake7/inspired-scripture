Kings 6: Lessons From Solomon’s Building of the Temple on What God
Desires from You</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter tells about the building of the
Temple. Today, your body is the new temple of the Spirit (1 Cor. 3:16).
From the building of the Temple, God reveals seven lessons regarding
what He wants from you in your walk with Him. These include: (1)
faithfulness, (2) fellowship, (3) reverence, (4) obedience, (5) purity,
(6) sanctification, and (7) gratitude.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, after hundreds of years, God fulfilled His promise to
allow His people to dwell securely in His Promised Land. To show that
His promise could be permanent, He allowed Solomon to build the Temple.
From this, God reveals that He is faithful to keep His promises to His
people. In response, He wants you to be faithful to Him. <u>Second</u>,
God told Solomon to build a “house” for Him. This was a place where the
people could fellowship with Him. God also desires your fellowship. That
fellowship is now possible through Jesus and the Holy Spirit.
<u>Third</u>, Solomon built the Temple with the stones cut in other
locations so that there would be no noise during the construction.
Solomon wanted to keep a reverent attitude at this place of future
worship. From this example, God reveals that He desires your worship to
be reverent as well. <u>Fourth</u>, God told Solomon that His promise to
dwell with the Jews was dependent upon their obedience. From this
account, God reveals that He desires obedience more than sacrifice.
<u>Fifth</u>, the inner part of the Temple, the Holy of Holies, had
gold-plated walls, ceilings, floors, and fixtures. This symbolized His
divinity, beauty, and purity that few would ever see. God also desires
inner purity in your walk with Him. This is true even if few ever see
it. <u>Sixth</u>, giant cherubim guarded the Ark where the Ten
Commandments were kept. In a similar way, God wants you to guard His
Word in your heart so that you will be sanctified or set apart from sin.
<u>Finally</u>, Solomon completed the Temple in seven years, a number
that symbolizes completion. The Temple provided the means to sacrifice
animals so that people could atone for their sins. Jesus is the Temple.
He came to complete the sacrificial system. His death ended the need for
further sacrifices. In response, God wants you to be grateful for Jesus’
completed work of salvation.</p>

<u>Faithfulness: God is Faithful to Keep His Promises to His People</u>.

<ul>
<li><p><u>God directs Solomon to build the Temple</u>. Exactly 480 years
after God fulfilled His promise to bring the Jews out of Egypt and after
firmly placing the Jews in control of the Promised Land, God directed
Solomon to begin building the Temple: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now it came
about in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel
came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign
over Israel, in the month of Ziv which is the second month, that he
began to build the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (1 Kgs. 6:1). These events are
real, and scholars are reasonably certain about when Solomon built the
Temple. Outside of the Bible, records establish that the division of
Israel occurred around 931 B.C. Based upon that time period, scholars
believe that King Solomon’s 40-year reign (1 Kgs. 11:42) began at or
near 971 B.C. Thus, if he began building the Temple during the fourth
year of his reign (1 Kgs. 6:1), he began building at or near 937 B.C.
The Bible describes 480 years as an exact number here (1 Kgs. 6:1). Yet
in the book of Acts, the number is listed as an approximation as 450
years (Act 13:19). If the 480 year number is correct, this would suggest
that the exodus took place sometime between 1447 and 1450 B.C. Yet,
based upon different historical records, other scholars attempt to place
the exodus at sometime between 1290 and 1250 B.C. (Paul R. House, The
New American Commentary, 1, 2 Kings Vol. 8 (B&amp;H Publishing Group
1995) p. 126-127).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s promises are real and you can trust in them</u>. God
repeatedly promised the patriarchs that He would turn the Jews into a
great nation and give them the Promised Land (Gen 15:5, 17; 22:17; 26:4;
28:3, 13-15; 35:11; Dt. 10:22; Heb. 11:12). He also promised that He
would never forget His covenant with His people: “ . . . ‘<em>I will
never break My covenant with you</em>,”’’ (Jdgs. 2:1). “then I will
remember My covenant with Jacob, and <em>I will remember also My
covenant</em> with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I
will remember the land.” (Lev. 26:42; Gen 35:11-12). “And <em>He
remembered His covenant</em> for their sake, and relented according to
the greatness of His lovingkindness.” (Ps. 106:45). The Jews had to wait
for God’s promises to come true. Yet, the Temple was meant to show that
His promises were real and they could be permanent. If the Jews obeyed,
they could dwell indefinitely in the Promised Land.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God put the needs of Israel ahead of His desire for a Temple
for worship</u>. God later explained that He delayed the building of the
Temple until the Jews and the line of David were firmly established in
the Promised Land: ‘“Since the day that I brought My people Israel from
Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel in which
to build a house that My name might be there, but I chose David to be
over My people Israel.’” (1 Kgs. 8:16). Jesus also came and submitted
Himself for all of mankind: “Have this attitude in yourselves which was
also in Christ Jesus, <sup>6 </sup>who, although He existed in the form
of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
<sup>7 </sup>but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and
being made in the likeness of men.” (Phil. 2:5-7). In turn, Jesus wants
you to submit to Him and to others in need (Eph. 5:21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon was faithful to obey the Word that God gave to
David</u>. God revealed the exact plans for the Temple to David. David
then passed them down to Solomon to build: “Then David gave to his son
Solomon the plan of the porch of the temple, its buildings, its
storehouses, its upper rooms, its inner rooms and the room for the mercy
seat; and the plan of all that he had in mind, for the courts of the
house of the LORD, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the
storehouses of the house of God and for the storehouses of the dedicated
things;” (1 Chr. 28:11-12). God not only told David how the Temple
should be built, He also stated that Solomon would be the one to build
it: “He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne
of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:13). “Behold, I intend to build a
house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my
father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place,
he will build the house for My name.”’ (1 Kgs. 5:5). Solomon was then
faithful to build the Temple in the exact manner that God revealed to
David. God also wants you to faithfully live by His Word, even if you do
not understand it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>In response to God's faithfulness, be faithful to Him</u>. It
would be easy for Jews to give up on God’s promises if they took
hundreds of years to fulfill. Most people expect immediate results in
response to their prayers. Few have the faith to believe in a promise if
it takes hundreds of years to fulfill. Yet, God wants you to be faithful
in response to His faithfulness, even if you don’t live to see all of
His promise come true. “His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and
faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in
charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.”’ (Matt.
25:21). Have you given God many reasons to celebrate your faith in
heaven?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon builds the Temple</u>. Using the plans that God
revealed to David (1 Chr. 28:11-12), Solomon was obedient to build the
Temple in the exact dimensions that God commended: “<sup>2 </sup><em>As
for the house which King Solomon built for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, its length was sixty cubits and its width
twenty cubits and its height thirty cubits. <sup>3 </sup>The porch in
front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits in length,
corresponding to the width of the house, and its depth along the front
of the house was ten cubits. <sup>4 </sup>Also for the house he made
windows with artistic frames. <sup>5</sup>Against the wall of the house
he built stories encompassing the walls of the house around both the
nave and the inner sanctuary; thus he made side chambers all around.
<sup>6 </sup>The lowest story was five cubits wide, and the middle was
six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside
he made offsets in the wall of the house all around in order that the
beams would not be inserted in the walls of the house</em>.” (1 Kgs.
6:2-6). These exact dimensions are repeated in the Book of Chronicles:
“Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for building the house
of God. The length in cubits, according to the old standard was sixty
cubits, and the width twenty cubits.” (2 Chr. 3:3). There is no modern
exact equation for translating a ‘cubit’ to a foot or a yard. The word
cubit comes from the Hebrew word “ammah” or “mother of arm.” The cubit
was a unit of measure used by the Jews, the Babylonians, the Egyptians
and likely others. Uncertainty exists as to whether it went from the
elbow to the root of the hand at the wrist or whether it included the
entire length from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger. Also,
different people have different arm lengths. Despite these
uncertainties, a cubit is usually considered to be about eighteen inches
in length. Others assume that a royal cubit was approximately 21 inches
long (2 Chr. 3:3). Assuming the 18-inch number is correct, the Temple
was approximately 30 feet wide, 45 feet high and 90 feet long. The
Temple was approximately double the dimensions of the tabernacle (Ex.
26:15-30; 36:20-34). It was three times as long as it was wide and half
as tall as it was long. This was only the main building. It did not
include the porch, the courtyards, or an adjacent structure described
below.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Temple was God’s “house” where His glory could dwell with
His people</u>. The Temple was called the “house” of the Lord:
“<sup>2 </sup><em>As for the house which King Solomon built for the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>” (1 Kgs. 6:2). God dwells in
heaven (Is. 66:1; Acts 7:48-49). Yet, He allowed His glory to dwell in
Israel with the Jews. First, His glory dwelt in the Tabernacle “Let them
construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may dwell among them.” (Ex. 25:8).
“I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God.” (Ex.
29:45). ‘“I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be
My people.”’ (Lev. 26:12). His presence later filled the Temple: “so
that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for
the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.” (1 Kgs. 8:11). Yet,
the sin of the Jews later forced God to remove His holy
presence.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Temple foreshadowed Jesus</u>. Jesus is our Temple (Rev.
21:22). The Temple that Solomon built therefore was in honor of Him. In
the book of Chronicles, the Bible reveals that “Then Solomon began to
build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD
had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared
on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. He began to build on the
second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.” (2 Chr.
3:1-2; 2 Sam. 24:24). The Temple was the place where people came to find
atonement. On Mount Moriah, Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice (Gen.
22:1-19). Here, Jesus also made the ultimate sacrifice so that all could
live who believe (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s glory later dwelt in Jesus</u>. God later sent Jesus so
that His glory could again dwell with His people: “And the Word became
flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only
begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (Jo. 1:14). When
Jesus left, He promised that a part of God’s glory could again dwell
within us through the Holy Spirit: “The glory which You have given Me I
have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one;” (Jo.
17:22). “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the
glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory
to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Cor. 3:18). Because His
glory now lives in you, there should be evidence of that in your
walk.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The special future role for the Temple Mount</u>. Although the
Bible is clear that God’s Shekinah glory has moved at different times to
different places, there is one place where it will return to. That is
the Temple Mount in Israel. God also made a promise that His eyes would
forever be placed on the Temple Mount: “The LORD said to him, ‘I have
heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me;
I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name
there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually.’” (1
Kgs. 9:3; 2 Chr. 33:7). On the ninth day of the fifth month in 70 A.D, a
day which later became known as the “fast of Av” (“Tisha B’Av”) (Zech.
7:3), the Romans burned the Temple. Centuries later, the Muslims built
the Dome El Rock on the grounds of the Temple Mount. In the future, the
devil plans to occupy a temple that will one day be rebuilt and declare
himself god (2 Thess. 2:1-3; Matt. 24:15). That will mark the beginning
of the Great Tribulation on Earth. After Jesus returns, God’s Shekinah
glory will again be present on a rebuilt Temple (Micah 4:1-8; Zech.
14:3-9). In heaven, you will also see the Shekinah glory of God the
Father and Jesus Christ without a veil (1 Jo. 3:2). You “will see His
face. . . [and] the Light of God (“Shekinah glory”) will illumine them
forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:5). In 1947, after almost 2,000 years in
exile, Israel became a country. It now controls the land surrounding the
Temple Mount, and there are groups actively seeking to rebuild the
Temple. It is safe to assume that we are living in the end times. Are
you living your life as if the Lord could return at any moment?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Temple that Solomon built also foreshadowed God’s “house”
in heaven</u>. The first covenant given to Moses involved earthly
sacrifices and worship. “Now even the first covenant had regulations of
divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.” (Heb. 9:1). Yet, studying the
early Temple is important because it provides a window into God’s
eternal sanctuary in heaven that believers will one day experience: “And
He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has
founded forever.” (Ps. 78:69). Ezekiel later saw a Temple in heaven with
the exact same dimensions: “The width of the entrance was ten cubits and
the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured
the length of the nave, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.”
(Ezek. 41:2). Thus, you can study the Temple to know more about where
you will spend most of your eternity worshiping Jesus. “My dwelling
place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be
My people.” (Ezek. 37:27). “And I heard a loud voice from the throne,
saying, ‘Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell
among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among
them,”’ (Rev. 21:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The porch welcomed both Jews and gentiles</u>. According to
the plans that David gave him, Solomon had the porch (1 Kgs. 6:3) built
facing to the east side of the Temple. To welcome God’s people, the
porch extended 20 cubits or approximately 30 feet long (1 Kgs. 6:3). The
entrance to the porch had two large pillars (1 Kgs. 7:21). On the north
side of the porch, the pillar was named Boaz (2 Chr. 3:15-17). His name
meant strength or boldness. On the south side, the pillar was named
Jachin (2 Chr. 3:15-17). His name means that Yah or Yahweh establishes.
Boaz redeemed and married the gentile Moabite woman named Ruth (Ruth
4:16-22). Their son became the grandfather of the future King David (1
Sam. 16:1-13; 17:12). His pillar symbolized the promise of redemption in
the Temple. Together, they show that God established a means to redeem
both Jews and gentiles. Because the Temple foreshadowed Jesus (Rev.
21:22), Jesus is the means of redemption for both Jews and Gentiles. He
also welcomes all who believe in Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The windows filled with God’s beautiful light</u>. The Temple
also had “<em>windows with artistic frames.</em>” (1 Kgs. 6:4). On a
practical level, the windows allowed the Temple to be filled with light
during the day. The windows also allowed smoke from burning incense to
leave and travel to heaven. More importantly, the artistic frames
emphasized the beauty of the light from the gold menorah (Ex. 27:20-21)
and the sanctuary lamp or “<em>ner tamid</em>” that burned inside. The
latter was the “eternal flame” or “eternal light”. God’s light dwelling
with the Jews was meant to burn as a beacon to others: “I will also make
You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of
the earth.”’ (Is. 49:6). “For so the Lord has commanded us, ‘I have
placed you as a light for the gentiles, that you may bring salvation to
the end of the Earth.’” (Acts 13:47). Jesus is the “true light” (Jo.
1:9) and the Light of the World (Jo. 8:12). Thus, the light came from
Him. The smoke that escaped through the windows symbolized the prayers
that ascended to heaven as a sweet aroma to God: “And the smoke of the
incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the
angel’s hand.” (Rev. 8:4). If you are now the Temple of the Holy Spirit,
are your prayers a sweet aroma to God: “May my prayer be counted as
incense before You; the lifting up of my hands as the evening offering”
(Ps. 141:2)? Or, are they filled with putrid complaints?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The six rooms for mankind’s service and fellowship</u>. The
Temple also had “<em>side chambers all around.”</em> (1 Kgs. 6:5). In
the Bible, six is the number of mankind. These chambers were there for
the priests to serve other people and to help them find fellowship with
God. This symbolized that God’s house was not cold and remote. It was a
place where people could come and receive His comfort through His
priests and servants. This symbolized that God created believers to live
in service to Him by performing good works for others: “For we are His
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared
beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10). Is God’s guiding
light in your life evident through your service to others?</p></li>

<u>Reverence: God Desires Your Reverent Worship</u>. 1 Kgs. 6:7-10.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Temple is built in reverence without construction
noises</u>. The Temple was made with stones that were cut in quarries
and then moved to the Temple on rollers where they were then quietly
placed together in reverence: “<sup>7 </sup><em>The house, while it was
being built, was built of stone prepared at the quarry, and there was
neither hammer nor axe nor any iron tool heard in the house while it was
being built. <sup>8 </sup>The doorway for the lowest side chamber was on
the right side of the house; and they would go up by winding stairs to
the middle story, and from the middle to the third. <sup>9 </sup>So he
built the house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and
planks of cedar. <sup>10 </sup>He also built the stories against the
whole house, each five cubits high; and they were fastened to the house
with timbers of cedar</em>.” (1 Kgs. 6:7-10). One commentator observes
the quiet building: “speaks to <em>the way God wants His work done</em>.
The temple had to be built with human labor. God did not and would not
send a team of angels to build the temple. Yet Solomon did not want the
sound of man’s work to dominate the site of the temple. He wanted to
communicate, as much as possible, that the temple was of God and not of
man. This speaks to <em>the way God works in His people</em>. Often the
greatest work in the Kingdom of God happens quietly. Yet, the building
site of the temple was only quiet because there was a lot of noise and
diligent work at the quarry.” (David Guzik on 1 Kgs. 6).<a href="#fn3"
id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The altar of the Temple was built from uncut stones</u>. God
commanded that the Jews build the altar from uncut stones. “If you make
an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if
you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.” (Ex. 20:25). “Moreover,
you shall build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones;
you shall not wield an iron tool on them. You shall build the altar of
the LORD your God of uncut stones, and you shall offer on it burnt
offerings to the LORD your God;” (Dt. 27:5-6). “just as Moses the
servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written
in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no
man had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to
the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.” (Josh. 8:31). He prohibited
the use of tools because He knew that people would use those tools to
create prohibited idols in the places of worship. He also did not want
people to marvel at the works of a person’s hand when their focus needed
to be on His Word. The uncut stones also had symbolic meaning. Every
believer is a “living stone” that He writes His Word on: “you also,
<em>as living stones</em>, are being built up as a spiritual house for a
holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 2:5). Like the altar that the Jews built,
He also promised to write His Law on His believer’s hearts (Jer. 31:33).
The uncut stone symbolizes the fact that no one can add or take away
from the Word that God has written on your heart. Is your life a blank
slate for God to write on? Or, are you trying to mold your own
life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The reverence of the Temple was important to make it a place
of worship</u>. One of the most important reasons for having God’s glory
dwell amongst the Jews was to allow the Jews to worship Him. Proper
worship requires reverence. The building process was meant to stress
this fact. “Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be
shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an
acceptable service with reverence and awe;” (Heb. 12:28). Is your walk
filled with reverent worship?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus was the door and the narrow stairway leading to
heaven</u>. For an adjacent structure, a door led to a stairway and
chambers on the first, second, and third floors (2 Chron. 3:4, 9).
<em>“The doorway for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of
the house; and they would go up by winding stairs to the middle story,
and from the middle to the third.</em>” (1 Kgs. 6:8). Jesus is the
“door” leading to salvation for those who believe in Him (Jo. 10:7). The
stairway would have been narrow leading up. Jesus is both the “truth”
(Jo. 14:6) and the “way” (Jo. 14:6). “For the gate is small and the way
is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Jo.
7:14). There are no shortcuts or alternative paths to heaven. Some
believe that the disciples met in one of these chambers after Jesus’
ascension: “When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper
room where they were staying; . . .” (Acts 1:13). Are you following the
narrow path to Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus was the strong foundation to the Temple</u>. Solomon
built the Temple with “<em>beams and planks of cedar.</em>” (1 Kgs 6:9).
This was the strongest available materials that came from King Huram in
Lebanon (1 Kgs. 5:5-6; 2 Chr. 2:3). The wood symbolized Jesus’
incorruptible body (Ps. 16:10(b); Acts 13:35). It also symbolized His
majesty and might (Ps. 92:12; Ezek. 31:3). Like the mighty support
system for the Temple, you can call Jesus “my salvation” (Ps. 18:2); “my
strength” (Ps. 28:7; Jer. 16:19); “my shield” (Ps. 28:7; Gen. 15:1); “my
deliverer . . . my merciful one, my fortress, my stronghold” (Ps. 144:2;
Na. 1:7); the “strong tower” (Prov. 18:10); “fortress” (Jer. 16:19);
“refuge” (Jer. 16:19); “our shade” (Ps. 121:5); “hiding place” (Ps.
32:7); “my savior,” (2 Sam. 22:3). Is Jesus the source of your strength
in times of crisis? Or, do you depend upon yourself?</p></li>

<u>Obedience: God Desires Obedience More Than Sacrifice</u>. 1 Kgs.
6:11-13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s conditional promise to allow His holy presence to dwell
in Israel</u>. God was pleased with Solomon’s efforts. He then promised
to allow His glory to dwell in the Temple. Yet, it was conditional on
the obedience of Solomon and his descendants: “<sup>11 </sup><em>Now the
word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came to Solomon saying,
<sup>12 </sup>“Concerning this house which you are building, if you will
walk in My statutes and execute My ordinances and keep all My
commandments by walking in them, then I will carry out My word with you
which I spoke to David your father. <sup>13 </sup>I will dwell among the
sons of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel</em>.” (1 Kgs.
6:11-13). Sin would later cause God to first limit His blessings and
then destroy the Temple. Yet, this happened only after repeated
warnings.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s promise of an eternal kingship through David’s line was
not conditional</u>. This conditional promise was unrelated to God’s
unconditional promise for David’s line of kings to last forever through
Jesus: “He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Sam. 7:13). Yet, the promise to have
a human king sit on the throne was conditional: “so that the LORD may
carry out His promise which He spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your
sons are careful of their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their
heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of
Israel.”’ (1 Kgs. 2:4). As a result of continued rebellion, the human
line of kings through David would come to an end. Yet, the eternal line
through Jesus, the King of Kings, will last forever: ‘“Behold, the days
are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a
righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do
justice and righteousness in the land.” (Jer. 23:5). “and He will reign
over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.” (Lk.
1:33). ‘“I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to
all generations.’ Selah.” (Ps. 89:4, 36). If Jesus is your redeemer, is
He also Lord over you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God would discipline the descendants of David out of love</u>.
God warned David that the eternal kingship would not exempt the kings
from discipline, just as a loving father disciplines a wayward son:
“<sup>14 </sup>I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me;
when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the
strokes of the sons of men,” (2 Sam. 7:14). In a similar way, God
disciplines His people out of love: “Thus you are to know in your heart
that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines
his son.” (Dt. 8:5). “It is for discipline that you endure; God deals
with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not
discipline?” (Heb. 12:7). “But when we are judged, we are disciplined by
the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.” (1 Cor.
11:32). If God has disciplined you, rejoice because He loves you. If He
has corrected you, have you changed your ways for Him?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will not forsake you when He disciplines you</u>. Even
though God would discipline Solomon’s descents, He promised never to
forsake them: “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at
them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not
fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6; Heb. 13:5). ‘“Moreover, I will make
My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject you.”’ (Lev. 26:11).
“No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just
as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or
forsake you.” (Josh. 1:5). “For the LORD will not abandon His people on
account of His great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you
a people for Himself.” (1 Sam. 12:22). “<em><sup> </sup></em>but My
lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul,
whom I removed from before you.” (2 Sam. 7:15). Sin would, however,
limit the extent of their blessing to the land of Judah: ‘“However, I
will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your
son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which
I have chosen.”’ (1 Kgs. 11:13). “So the LORD was very angry with Israel
and removed them from His sight; none was left except the tribe of
Judah.” (2 Kgs. 17:18). “But I will not break off My lovingkindness from
him, nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.” (Ps. 89:33). Sin may prevent
you from experiencing the fullness of God’s blessings. Yet, He will
never leave you or abandon you because of sin unless you reject Jesus as
your source of atonement.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God desires obedience more than sacrifice</u>. God wanted
Solomon’s obedience more than his sacrifice. “Samuel said, ‘Has the LORD
as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the
voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed
than the fat of rams.” (1 Sam. 15:22). David previously learned that
“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, You will not despise.” (Ps. 51:17). Are you obedient in
your walk with Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. A
believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. Yet, Jesus is not your Lord if you
disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in
heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and
do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the
word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22).
“Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may
be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt.
7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them,
will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt.
7:26). If you call Jesus your Lord, is there any area of your life where
you are refusing to obey Him?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon builds the gold inner sanctuary for the Holy of
Holies</u>. After building the exterior structure, Solomon had his
builders create the inner sanctuary where true fellowship with God was
made possible through the blood of atonement: “<sup>14 </sup><em>So
Solomon built the house and finished it. <sup>15 </sup>Then he built the
walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of
the house to the ceiling he overlaid the walls on the inside with wood,
and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
<sup>16 </sup>He built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with
boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built them for it on
the inside as an inner sanctuary, even as the most holy place.
<sup>17 </sup>The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner
sanctuary, was forty cubits long. <sup>18 </sup>There was cedar on the
house within, carved in the shape of gourds and open flowers; all was
cedar, there was no stone seen. <sup>19 </sup>Then he prepared an inner
sanctuary within the house in order to place there the ark of the
covenant of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>20</sup> The
inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, twenty cubits in width, and
twenty cubits in height, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also
overlaid the altar with cedar. <sup>21 </sup>So Solomon overlaid the
inside of the house with pure gold. And he drew chains of gold across
the front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold.
<sup>22 </sup>He overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house
was finished. Also the whole altar which was by the inner sanctuary he
overlaid with gold</em>.” (1 Kgs. 6:14-22). Assuming a cubit is 18
inches, the inner sanctuary was in a cube shape, 30 feet in each
direction. It became known as the Holy of Holies: “Behind the second
veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,” (Heb.
9:3). It was in this room where the Ark of the covenant was kept (1 Kgs.
6:19). It was similar to the Holy of Holies inside the Tabernacle (Ex.
26:33-34).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The strong cedar support beams</u>. The Holy of Holies was
supported by cedar walls and floors from King Hiram (1 Kgs. 6:15-21;
5:8; 2 Chron. 3:5). The wood again symbolized Jesus’ incorruptible body
(Ps. 16:10(b); Acts 13:35) and His majesty and might (Ps. 92:12; Ezek.
31:3). He should also be your strength and support (Ps. 28:7; Jer.
16:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The purity of God</u>. The Holy of Holies was overlaid with
pure 24 karat gold (1 Kgs. 6:21-22). The Ark and other items inside were
also overlaid with pure gold (1 Kgs. 7:48-49). The gold symbolized God’s
riches, His beauty, His purity, and His divinity. The gold in the Temple
also foreshadows the gold throughout heaven: “The material of the wall
was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.” (Rev. 21:18).
“And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a
single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent
glass.” (Rev. 21:21). If your body is now the Temple of the Holy Spirit
(1 Cor. 3:16), God wants you to be pure as well: “Or what agreement has
the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God;
just as God said, ‘I will dwell in them and walk among them; and I will
be their God, and they shall be My people.”’ (2 Cor. 6:16). Are you
tolerating evil anywhere in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The veil protecting sinful mankind from God’s glory</u>.
Solomon built the Holy of Holies with “<em>chains of gold across the
front of the inner sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold.</em>” (1
Kgs. 6:21). The veil was needed because sin separated mankind from God:
“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God . .
.” (Is. 59:2(a)). God has looked down from heaven and observed that not
one person is holy and without sin: “[I]t is written, ‘There is none
righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who
seeks God.”’ (Rom. 3:10-11). “[T]here is no one who does good.” (Ps.
14:1; 53:1). “Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living
is righteous before you.” (Ps. 143:2). “If we claim to be without sin,
we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” (1 Jo. 1:8). God’s
holy presence is a consuming fire that cannot be in the presence of sin
(Heb. 12:29). Christ, however, came to restore our access to
God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Christ’s tearing of the veil</u>. Christ’s death later caused
the curtain to rip from the top to the bottom: “And behold, the
<em>veil</em> of the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the
earth shook and the rocks were split.” (Matt. 27:51; Mk. 15:38). His
blood made us clean (Heb. 9:8-15). We can therefore now enter the Holy
of Holies every day “with confidence” to petition in prayer for
ourselves and others: “Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the
throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in
time of need.” (Heb. 4:16). By contrast, the High Priest in Old
Testament times could only enter the Holy of Holies once per year and
only after making a blood sacrifice to pray for the nation. “but into
the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking
blood, . . .” (Heb. 9:7; Lev. 16:17-18, 29). Any believer in Christ is
also part of His nation of priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). Are you
using your access to pray with confidence for both your needs and the
needs of others?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The house for the Ark of the covenant</u>. The Holy of Holies
housed the Ark of the covenant of the Lord (1 Kgs. 6:19). The Ark housed
the Ten commandments (Ex. 25:16, 21; 40:20; Dt. 10:1-5). It also housed
the budding rod of Aaron (Nu. 17:10). This represents the new life of
the Holy Spirit, which is only made possible through Christ’s death (Jo.
1:4; 3:16; 11:25-26; 14:19). The New Testament reveals that the contents
of the ark also included a golden jar with some of the manna that rained
down from heaven for 40 years to sustain the Jews in the wilderness
(Heb. 9:4; Ex. 16:32-34). Jesus was the bread of life that rained down
on the Jews in the wilderness (Jo. 6:35; 6:48-51). He is also the Word
who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). At the Ark of the covenant, God’s
presence met with Israel to fellowship with them (Ex. 25:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be pure because God cares more about what is on the inside
than the outside</u>. The Holy of Holies and the gold fixtures were all
either solid gold or gold-plated. This gold would only have been seen by
the high priest and not by the masses. From this, God reveals that He
cares more about your purity on the inside than your outward
appearances. Jesus had a heart of gold. He sacrificed His own life so
that all could live, even those who persecuted Him (Jo. 3:16). He also
forgave those who crucified Him (Lk. 23:34). He lived to heal the lame,
to free those who were oppressed, and to give sight to the blind (Lk.
4:18). He also did nothing to develop an outward appearance that others
might consider to be handsome or attractive. “He has no stately form or
majesty that we should look upon Him, nor appearance that we should be
attracted to Him.” (Is. 53:2). He also did not seek to enrich Himself on
earth. He did not even have a bed to lay His head on (Matt. 8:20; 9:58).
Like the Temple, Jesus was a model to us. The gold should be in your
heart hidden from others. You should not worry about your outward
appearance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will know if you are a “whitewashed” tomb, lacking in
integrity</u>. We can maintain a pretty exterior for others to see while
allowing self-indulgence and sin to run rampant when no one is looking.
This is the exact opposite of what the Temple represented. God also
knows if you are leading a double life that is filled with hypocrisy.
Christ called the Pharisees who lived this way “whitewashed tombs”: “Woe
to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of
the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and
self-indulgence. <sup>26 </sup>You blind Pharisee, first clean the
inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become
clean also. <sup>27 </sup>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear
beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men’s bones and all
uncleanness. <sup>28 </sup>So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to
men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” (Matt.
25:25-28). Is there any hypocrisy in your walk with God?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The cherubim guarding the Holy of Holies</u>. Solomon also
built cherubim to protect the Ark: “<sup>23 </sup><em>Also in the inner
sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
<sup>24 </sup>Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits
the other wing of the cherub; from the end of one wing to the end of the
other wing were ten cubits. <sup>25 </sup>The other cherub was ten
cubits; both the cherubim were of the same measure and the same form.
<sup>26 </sup>The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was
the other cherub. <sup>27 </sup>He placed the cherubim in the midst of
the inner house, and the wings of the cherubim were spread out, so that
the wing of the one was touching the one wall, and the wing of the other
cherub was touching the other wall. So their wings were touching each
other in the center of the house. <sup>28 </sup>He also overlaid the
cherubim with gold. <sup>29 </sup>Then he carved all the walls of the
house round about with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and
open flowers, inner and outer sanctuaries. <sup>30 </sup>He overlaid the
floor of the house with gold, inner and outer sanctuaries.
<sup>31 </sup>For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of
olive wood, the lintel and five-sided doorposts. <sup>32 </sup>So he
made two doors of olive wood, and he carved on them carvings of
cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and
he spread the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
<sup>33 </sup>So also he made for the entrance of the nave four-sided
doorposts of olive wood <sup>34 </sup>and two doors of cypress wood; the
two leaves of the one door turned on pivots, and the two leaves of the
other door turned on pivots. <sup>35 </sup>He carved on it cherubim,
palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly
applied on the engraved work</em>.” (1 Kgs. 6:23-35). In 2 Chronicles,
the Bible repeats that two large cherubim stood guard above the Ark (2
Chr. 3:7, 10). In 2 Chronicles, the Bible also reveals that they faced
the door (2 Chr. 3:13). These were in addition to the two cherubim that
stood guard above the mercy seat: “You shall make two cherubim of gold,
make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat. Make one
cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; you shall make the
cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends. The cherubim
shall have their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their
wings and facing one another; the faces of the cherubim are to be turned
toward the mercy seat.” (Ex. 25:18-20; Nu. 7:89). “and above it were the
cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we
cannot now speak in detail.” (Heb. 9:5). In addition, the gold-plated
Holy of Holies had pictures of peaceful palm trees and other cherubim.
This all symbolized that the contents inside were worth
protecting.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The cherubim guarded the contents of the throne room</u>. God
did not need protecting. Yet, the cherubim guarded the contents of the
Ark from Satan who seeks to snatch God’s Word from mankind (Ex. 25:22;
Nu. 7:89; 1 Kgs. 8:6-8). Believers are to also guard God’s Word in their
heart to protect themselves from Satan’s temptations to sin: “Your word
I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You.” (Ps.
119:11). “The law of his God is in his heart; His steps do not slip.”
(Ps. 37:31). If you don’t memorize God’s Word, Satan will try to remove
it from your life: “When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does
not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been
sown in his heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the
road.” (Matt. 13:19). If you want to honor God and show Him reverence,
memorize and follow His Ten Commandments. Have you memorized His
Commandments?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The contents of the Ark brought the peace of the Holy
Spirit</u>. The cherubim protected the Word because it symbolized God’s
peace, made available to believers through the Holy Spirit. This is
represented by the fact that the cherubim first appeared in Scripture
protecting the peaceful Garden of Eden after God expelled mankind (Gen.
3:24). This point is emphasized by the palm trees and flowers on the
walls and doors (1 Kgs. 6:29, 32). This point is also emphasized by the
fact that the cherubim were made of olive wood (1 Kgs. 6:23). In the
Bible, olive oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (1 Sam. 16:13). If you
treasure God’s Ten Commandments in your heart and follow them, the Holy
Spirit will give you His peace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The cherubim’s wings symbolized the protections offered
through God’s mercy</u>. The wings of the massive cherubim extended 15
feet from one wing tip to another. They were so massive that they
touched both walls of the Holy of Holies (1 Kgs. 6:24-27). Their
extensive covering symbolized the complete mercy and grace that God
offers. This protection is available to anyone who accepts Jesus in
faith as their Lord and Savior.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The door leading to the throne symbolized Jesus</u>. The
entrance to the throne room had a large door (1 Kgs. 6:32-35). Jesus is
the “door” leading to salvation for those who believe in Him (Jo. 10:7).
As stated above, He is also the “truth” (Jo. 14:6) and the “way” (Jo.
14:6). Many will assume that all paths lead to the same place. Yet, the
way is narrow and runs exclusively through Jesus (Matt. 7:13-14; Is.
35:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The cherubim also guard the throne room in heaven</u>. The
image of cherubim in the Holy of Holies also provides a glimpse into the
throne room that believers will experience for eternity: “Let the people
tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; let the earth be moved!” (Ps.
99:1; 80:1; 1 Sam 4:4). “Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that
was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in
appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them.” (Ezek. 10:1). “It
was carved with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between
cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces, . . . Also there were
carved on them, on the doors of the nave, cherubim and palm trees like
those carved on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the
front of the porch outside.” (Ezek. 41:18, 25). Thus, the throne room
will be a place of God’s beauty, splendor, and glory. There, you will
also receive His protection, His mercy, His grace, and His peace that
will guard you: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all
comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”
(Phil. 4:7).</p></li>

Gratitude: Be Grateful for Jesus’ Completed Work of Salvation. 1 Kgs.
7:36-38.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon completes building of the Temple after seven
years</u>. After seven years, Solomon completed the Temple:
“<sup>36 </sup><em>He built the inner court with three rows of cut stone
and a row of cedar beams. <sup>37 </sup>In the fourth year the
foundation of the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was
laid, in the month of Ziv. <sup>38 </sup>In the eleventh year, in the
month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished
throughout all its parts and according to all its plans. So he was seven
years in building it</em>.” (1 Kgs. 7:36-38). The inner court that
surrounded the Temple was called the “court of the priests” (2 Chr. 4:9)
or the “upper court” (Jer. 36:10). The outer court or greater courtyard
is described in the next chapter (1 Kgs. 7:12). If the building of the
Temple took 7 years and 6 months to build and finished in the eighth
calendar month (1 Kgs. 6:38; 2 Chr. 5:1), the construction finished in
November of the seventh year. This would have been in time for either
Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, or Sukkot. These were times to celebrate the
new beginnings that came from the forgiveness of sin.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The completed work of salvation</u>. In the Bible, the number
seven symbolizes completion. The completed Temple allowed for the Jews
to conduct proper atonement sacrifices. The Temple, however,
foreshadowed the completed work of salvation made possible through
Jesus: “but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat
down at the right hand of God,” (Heb. 10:12). Thus, you can give thanks
that you no longer need to sacrifice animals for your salvation. Jesus’
death forever made that unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for Jesus’ one-time sacrifice for you</u>. If you
understand that Jesus represented the fulfillment of the Temple
sacrifices, you should respond with gratitude and praise: “in everything
give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess.
5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;” (Eph. 5:20; Ps. 116:1, 17-18;
56:12-13; 116:8; 107:1, 2, 22). How have you given thanks for God’s
mercy and grace, made possible through Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of gratitude, make your life a living sacrifice for
Christ</u>. Instead of making physical sacrifices, you are called upon
to make “spiritual sacrifices” to Him (1 Pet. 2:5). This includes
praising God in all that you do: “Through Him then, let us continually
offer up a <em>sacrifice of praise</em> to God, that is, the fruit of
lips that give thanks to His name.” (Heb. 13:15). This also includes
presenting your body as a living sacrifice for God: “Therefore I urge
you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies <em>a
living and holy sacrifice</em>, acceptable to God, which is your
spiritual service of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). Out of gratitude for His
mercy and grace, are you offering Christ the best of your life?</p></li>
