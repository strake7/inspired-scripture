<h1 id="proverbs-16-lessons-for-living-under-jesus-sovereign-rule"><strong>Proverbs 16: Lessons for Living Under Jesus’ Sovereign Rule</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>:  Proverbs 16 begins and ends with Solomon’s declarations that Yahweh is sovereign (Prov. 16:1, 33).  Yahweh, the great I AM, is another name for Jesus.  (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14).  Our God-given wisdom comes through Him (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 2:3).  Through Solomon’s declarations about Yahweh’s sovereignty, the Bible reveals seven lessons for living under Jesus’ sovereign rule.  These include: (1) trusting His plans, (2) faith in His atonement, (3) obedience, (4) seeking peace, (5) humility, (6) His wisdom in His Word, and (7) fearing Him.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one through four, Solomon stressed that Yahweh is sovereign over every person’s thoughts and actions.  Because Jesus is in full control of everything, you can trust in His plans for you.  <u>Second</u>, in verses five through eight, Solomon stressed the importance of seeking atonement and righteousness.  As your sovereign Lord and Savior, Jesus offers the only path through faith in Him to find righteousness.  <u>Third</u>, in verses nine through 13, Solomon stressed the importance of seeking out and obeying Yahweh’s sovereignty in every aspect of your life.  Because Jesus is sovereign, you should also seek out and obey His direction in every aspect of your life.  <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 14 through 17, Solomon stressed the importance of seeking to bring peace to difficult situations and to take refuge in Yahweh to avoid evil.  Because Jesus is in control, you can also show your trust in Him by seeking peace during a conflict and by taking refuge in Him to avoid evil.  <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 18 and 19, Solomon warned how pride leads to destruction.  Because Jesus is God and will judge sin, He wants you to always be humble.  <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 20 through 26, Solomon emphasized the importance of trusting Yahweh’s Word to both find and share wisdom.  <u>Finally</u>, in verses 27 through 33, Solomon stressed the importance of avoiding evil and trusting in Yahweh.  Jesus also wants you to trust and fear Him by hating evil.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sovereign plans will be accomplished</u>. Unless your plans and words are Jesus’ plans, they will not succeed. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>The plans of the heart belong to a person,</em> <em>but the answer of the tongue is from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Prov. 16:1). One commentator explains the meaning of this verse as follows, “after man has done his utmost in planning, his wisest plans may come to nought in the comparatively easy act of giving utterance to them with a view to their accomplishment, unless Jehovah guides his tongue. And the implied moral of the proverb is, If you cannot do the less without God, do not attempt to do the greater without Him; ‘In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/3-5.htm"><u>Proverbs 3:5-6</u></a>. (Thomas Thomason Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Prov. 16:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is in control</u>. You do not need to fear the future or evil people because Jesus is in control. “Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For you are just a vapor that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, ‘If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.”’ (Jam. 4:14-15). “Many plans are in a person’s heart, but the advice of the LORD will stand.” (Prov. 19:21). “The steps of a man are established by the LORD, and He delights in his way.” (Ps. 37:23). “I know, LORD, that a person’s way is not in himself, nor is it in a person who walks to direct his steps.” (Jer. 10:23). Even though you will experience pain, your pain fulfills His greater good. “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus knows the motives behind our actions</u>. Because Jesus is sovereign and omnipotent, He knows our true motives. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>All the ways of a person are clean in his own sight, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> examines the motives</em>.” (Prov. 16:2). “We too often content ourselves with looking at our ways; God looks at ourselves. He takes the inner man into account, estimates actions by motives, and so very often differs from our judgment of ourselves and of one another…We ought to keep ourselves in very close union with Jesus Christ, because if we cling to Him in simple faith, He will come into our hearts, and we shall be saved from walking in darkness, and have the light of life shining down upon our deeds.” (Alexander MacLaren’s Expositions of Holy Scripture, Prov. 16:2).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus examines our hearts to correct our motives</u>. Because the heart is deceitful, Jesus examines our motives. “Every person’s way is right in his own eyes, but the LORD examines the hearts.” (Prov. 21:2). “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10). “But the LORD said to Samuel, ‘Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”’ (1 Sam. 16:7). “And He said to them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but God knows your hearts; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God.”’ (Lk. 16:15). “that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things.” (1 Jo. 3:20). Because the heart is deceitful, every person should welcome Jesus’ examination and correction. “Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test and know my anxious thoughts; and see if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.” (Ps. 139:23-24).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek to fulfill Jesus’ sovereign will</u>. If you seek to fulfill Jesus’ will and not your own, your plans will succeed. “<strong><sup>3</sup></strong> <em>Commit your works to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and your plans will be established</em>.” (Prov. 16:3). “Refer all thy actions and concerns to God, and to his glory, as the end of them, and in the discharge of thy own duty depend upon God’s providence for assistance and success.” (Matthew Poole’s Commentary on Prov. 16:3).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Walk by faith in Jesus’ plans</u>. If you trust in Jesus’ plans, He will ensure your success. “Commit your way to the LORD, trust also in Him, and He will do it.” (Ps. 37:5). “for we walk by faith, not by sight—” (2 Cor. 5:7). “Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” (Ps. 55:22). “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). “For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” (Jer. 29:11).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust that evil people must submit to Jesus’ sovereign will</u>. Even when we encounter evil people who seemingly commit evil acts without immediate consequences, you can trust that Jesus only allows for this as part of His greater plans for good. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has made everything for its own purpose, even the wicked for the day of evil</em>.” (Prov. 16:4). “The assertion that “He has made the wicked for the day of evil,” does not mean that He created any one for punishment—<em>i.e., </em>predestined him for destruction. It only teaches that even the wicked are subservient to God’s eternal purposes; that Pharaoh, for instance, by his rebellion could not change God’s plans for the deliverance of His people, but only gave Him an occasion for showing forth His power, justice, goodness, and longsuffering.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 16:4).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Evil is allowed to exist as part of Jesus’ sovereign plans</u>. Jesus’ wants you to trust that He only allows for trials and tribulations to fulfill His greater plans. “The LORD of armies has sworn, saying, ‘Certainly, just as I have intended, so it has happened, and just as I have planned, so it will stand,”’ (Is. 14:24). “The One forming light and creating darkness, causing well-being and creating disaster; I am the LORD who does all these things.” (Is. 45:7). “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, saying, ‘My plan will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure’;” (Is. 46:10). “What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with great patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon objects of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,” (Ro. 9:22-23). “In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will,” (Eph. 1:11).</p></li>

Prov. 16:5-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>In His sovereign timing, Jesus will judge sin</u>. Even though Jesus temporarily allows evil to exist, all who refuse to repent out of pride will one day face His divine judgment. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; be assured, he will not go unpunished</em>.” (Prov. 16:5). “Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 16:5).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Pride causes sinners to deny Jesus’ sovereignty</u>. Pride is one of the things that Jesus “hates” (Prov. 6:16-17). “When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom.” (Prov. 11:2). “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:18). “Before destruction the heart of a person is haughty, but humility goes before honor.” (Prov. 18:12). “For the LORD is exalted, yet He looks after the lowly, but He knows the haughty from afar.” (Ps. 138:6). Jesus will judge those who exalt themselves. “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ … Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:6, 10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sovereign plan includes His atonement</u>. Jesus’ sovereign plans include mercy for all sinners. Believers only need to repent and believe in His atoning sacrifice. The “fear of the Lord,” defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:13), is the fruit of that faith. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>By mercy and truth atonement is made for wrongdoing, and by the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> one keeps away from evil</em>.” (Prov. 16:6). “God in His <strong>mercy and truth</strong> has provided <strong>atonement</strong> for <strong>iniquity</strong>. God’s <strong>mercy</strong> prompted the great sacrifice of Jesus Messiah on the cross, and His <strong>truth</strong> made it necessary to make atonement in a way that honored the righteousness of God … The great principle of <strong>the fear of the LORD</strong> is not only the beginning of wisdom (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Proverbs+1.7&amp;t=NKJV">Proverbs 1:7</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Proverbs+9.10&amp;t=NKJV">9:10</a>), it is also the foundation of a God-honoring life. To live in the <strong>fear of the LORD</strong> is to depart <strong>from evil</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 16:6).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus’ sovereign plans include His atonement and offer of mercy to all who believe<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sovereign plans are filled with mercy, compassion, and love</u>. Even though Jesus’ sovereign plans allow for evil and suffering to temporarily exist, He is a loving, compassionate, and merciful God. “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth; who keeps faithfulness for thousands, who forgives wrongdoing, violation of His Law, and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, inflicting the punishment of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.” (Ex. 34:6-7). “The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in mercy.” (Ps. 103:8). “Who is a God like You, who pardons wrongdoing and passes over a rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in mercy.” (Mic. 7:18). “I, I alone, am the one who wipes out your wrongdoings for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.” (Is. 43:25). Jesus came to fulfill these promises. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous, so that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9; Eph. 1:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you seek to fulfill Jesus’ will, He will guard you from evil people</u>. If Jesus is your Lord and Savior and you seek to fulfill His sovereign will, He will ensure that your enemies don’t succeed in their efforts to stop you. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>When a person’s ways are pleasing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he causes even his enemies to make peace with him</em>.” (Prov. 16:7). “The best way to have our enemies reconciled unto us, is for us first to be reconciled unto God; for such is the love which the Lord hath to pious and virtuous persons, that when all their designs and actions are such as he approves, he often inclines even those that were their foes to become their friends, disposing their hearts to kindness toward them.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on the Old and New Testaments, Prov. 16:7).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God repeatedly melted the hearts of enemies to allow His plans to be fulfilled</u>. When Jacob turned back to God and followed His will, his brother Esau reconciled with him (Gen. 33:4). Likewise, when David showed mercy upon Saul, Saul repented to David and allowed David and his men to escape (1 Sam. 24:16-17). Even Pharaoh at one point confessed his sins against God to Moses and Aaron (Ex. 10:16-17). “And who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?” (1 Pet. 3:13; Ro. 12:18; Heb. 12:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus and submitting to Him includes being content and righteous</u>. Persons who do not accept that Jesus is in control are more likely to take ethical shortcuts to obtain wealth. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>Better is a little with righteousness than great income with injustice</em>.” (Prov. 16:8). “A man that is honest in his dealings, many times will not be wealthy, but will be blessed by the Lord. This is better than great wealth.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 16:8).<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Place your treasures in heaven and flee from all forms of covetousness</u>. The Bible repeatedly stresses the importance of righteousness over wealth. “Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked.” (Ps. 37:16). “Better is a little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure, and turmoil with the treasure.” (Prov. 15:16). “But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either.” (1 Tim. 6:6-7). “Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have;…” (Hebr. 13:5). Jesus offers to help you find contentment in Him while living in a fallen world (Phil. 4:11; 2 Cor. 12:9). Those who place their contentment in money will find that their needs are never fully satisfied (Ecc. 4:6). Thus, believers must be wary of any form of covetousness (Lk. 12:15; 1 Tim. 6:9-11). If you trust in Jesus’ sovereignty, He will provide for your needs, not wants. “Do not worry then, saying, ‘What are we to eat?’ or ‘What are we to drink?’ or ‘What are we to wear for clothing?’ For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:31-33; Lk. 12:19-31).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will direct the steps of those who seeks out and obey His sovereign will</u>. If you pray for Jesus’ will and submit to it, He will direct you. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The mind of a person plans his way, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> directs his steps</em>.” (Prov. 16:9). “Man meditates and prepares his plans with the utmost solicitude, but it rests with God whether he shall carry them to completion or not, and whether, if they are to be accomplished, it be done with ease or with painful labor (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-12.htm"><u>Genesis 24:12</u></a>, etc.).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 16:9).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Unless Jesus directs your steps, your success will not last over time</u>. In the long term, only Jesus’ plans endure. “Many plans are in a person’s heart, but the advice of the LORD will stand.” (Prov. 19:21). “Remember the former things long past, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, ‘My plan will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure’;” (Is. 46:9-10).</p></li>

<p>Seek to fulfill Jesus’ will, and He will ensure your success<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be obedient in following Jesus’ will so that you do not stumble others</u>. In whatever circle of authority or influence that Jesus has placed you, be sure that you are obedient in accurately representing His will. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>A divine verdict is on the lips of the king; his mouth should not err in judgment</em>.” (Prov. 16:10). Because all human leaders will sin and fall short, “it is best to understand this of the King of kings, of the King Messiah; into whose lips grace is poured, and from whence none but words of wisdom, grace, and truth, flow; who taught the way of God in truth; who had the word of God in his heart and in his month continually; and on whom the Spirit of wisdom without measure dwelt; and is the wisdom and word of God, as well as the power of God; his mouth transgresseth not in judgment;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 16:10).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus gives leaders their authority, they must not abuse it</u>. When a leader rules with wisdom, that wisdom comes from Jesus. “By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly.” (Prov. 8:15-16). In His sovereignty, Jesus also controls when a leader’s rule begins and ends. “It is He who changes the times and the periods; He removes kings and appoints kings; He gives wisdom to wise men, and knowledge to people of understanding.” (Dan. 2:21; Ps. 75:6-7; Job 12:23; Is. 40:23). Thus, believers should still submit to authority unless they are asked to do evil. “Every person is to be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.” (Rom. 13:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey Jesus by being righteous in all areas of your life</u>. As one example of righteousness, believers must not deceive others in their business dealings. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>A just balance and scales belong to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; all the weights of the bag are His concern</em>.” (Prov. 16:11). “People are not to think that trade lies outside the divine law. God has commanded there also all that belongs to truth and right.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 16:11).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>If you trust Jesus’ sovereign plans, you do not need to embrace evil to get ahead</u>. Because believers represent Jesus’ light to the lost, they must never defraud others in business or in any other context. “A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is His delight.” (Prov. 11:1; 20:10, 23; Lev. 19:35-36; Dt. 25:13-16). “You shall have accurate balances, an accurate ephah, and an accurate bath.” (Ezek. 45:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Leaders who embrace evil abuse their God-given authority</u>. Because all authority is God-given, it is an abomination to Him when they abuse it. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>It is an abomination for kings to commit wicked acts, because a throne is established on righteousness</em>.” (Prov. 16:12). “Rulers are rightly expected, by their position, to hate evil; for their power is sustained by righteousness.” (Jamieson-Fauset-Brown Bible Commentary, Prov. 1:12).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Leaders show their fear of the Lord when they rule righteously</u>. Rulers should always fear God by avoiding evil to ensure that they do not misrepresent Him. “The God of Israel said it; the Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘He who rules over mankind righteously, who rules in the fear of God,” (2 Sam. 23:3). “By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly.” (Prov. 8:15). “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1; Ro. 13:3-5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To obey Jesus’ will, leaders should surround themselves with godly counselors</u>. A God-fearing ruler will seek to ensure that Jesus’ will is done by seeking out and listening to Spirit-led counselors. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>Righteous lips are the delight of kings, and one who speaks right is loved</em>.” (Prov. 16:13). “As a king, Solomon appreciated those who spoke with godly truth. Indeed, the rise or fall of an entire kingdom depended upon righteousness. Proverbs 14:34 assures us that ‘righteousness exalts a nation.’ Although few people are ruled by a king, it is still true that a righteous leader and a righteous nation are essential to peace and prosperity. Regardless of the exact relationship, those who seek advice should appreciate godly counselors.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 16:13).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>To obey Jesus’ will, speak the truth out of love</u>. Regardless of whether you are advising a leader or a friend, following Jesus’ will requires that you speak the truth out of love. “Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, but those who deal faithfully are His delight.” (Prov. 12:22). “One who walks with integrity, practices righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart. He does not slander with his tongue, nor do evil to his neighbor, nor bring shame on his friend;” (Ps. 15:2-3). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in secret You will make wisdom known to me.” (Ps. 51:6; 119:29).</p></li>

Prov. 16:14-17.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Respond to those driven by their flesh by seeking peace and reconciliation</u>. Many leaders will sadly abuse their God-given authority and hurt others through evil actions. When this happens, believers should seek peace and reconciliation. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>The fury of a king is like messengers of death; but a wise person will appease it</em>.” (Prov. 16:14). “Whether at home, school, or work, understanding how to approach authority figures thoughtfully is instrumental in maintaining harmony. Embracing wisdom means developing empathy toward others, genuinely seeking to understand their perspectives and needs. Another crucial take-away from this proverb is the reminder of the profound impact our words and actions can have during tense situations. Choosing a response guided by peace instead of fear can lead to favorable outcomes.” (ExplainingtheBible.com, Prov. 16:14).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers should employ prayer and peaceful words when faced with evil leaders</u>. Without any checks on their power, an angry king could mean a quick death for someone who had provoked his anger. Haman’s quick execution after Esther exposed his deceit is a good example of this (Esther 7:7-8). Believers must first turn from evil to lessen the chance of provoking a powerful person’s anger. “Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” (Ps. 34:14). The second lesson is to turn to Jesus for wisdom and direction (Jam. 1:5). The third lesson is to trust Jesus and not your own understanding (Prov. 3:5-6). The fourth lesson is to obey Jesus’ guidance (Lk. 6:46). When the situation remains tense, the fifth lesson is to remain calm in the face of anger. “If the ruler’s temper rises against you, do not abandon your place, because composure puts great offenses to rest.” (Ecc. 10:4). The sixth lesson is to respond to anger with gentle words. “A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” (Prov. 15:1). The final lesson is to pursue peace when it is possible. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.” (Matt. 5:9; Jam. 3:18; Heb. 12:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Bringing peace to a difficult situation will bless others</u>. When you obey Jesus’ sovereign will to bring calm and reconciliation, you bring Jesus’ blessings to those around you. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>In the light of a king’s face is life, and his favor is like a cloud with the spring rain</em>.” (Prov. 16:15). “As we reflect on Proverbs 16:15, we are called to embody the characteristics of a good leader. Leaders have the privilege of influencing others positively. Our ability to show kindness, support, and approval can significantly impact the lives around us. We should remember that our energy can uplift or bring down an entire community. Let us choose to shine brightly in our everyday interactions and create an atmosphere where everyone can thrive. By fostering kindness and encouragement, we contribute to a world full of hope and vitality.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 16:15).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Calming a leader who lives by the flesh brings blessings to those living under the leader</u>. When a worldly leader is placated, his or her subjects benefit. An example of this was when Pharaoh appointed Joseph to be the second most powerful person in Egypt (Gen. 41:37-44). Another example was when the Persian King Ahasuerus (aka Xerxes) appointed Mordecai as the number two person (Esth. 8:1-7; 10:3). In both cases, the king’s favor brought blessings (symbolized as rain) on God’s people. But believers must avoid seeking the favor of powerful people. “The fear of man brings a snare, but one who trusts in the LORD will be protected.” (Prov. 29:25). Instead, believers should seek Jesus’ favor and trust Him to provide. “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in noblemen.” (Ps. 118:9). “Many are saying, ‘Who will show us anything good?’ Lift up the light of Your face upon us, LORD!” (Ps. 4:6; 30:5; 31:16; 80:3; Nu. 6:25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is greater than money</u>. Jesus’ wisdom can bring calm to potentially deadly situations. Thus, His wisdom is greater than any worldly treasure. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver</em>.” (Prov. 16:16). “Many throughout biblical history, such as Daniel, demonstrate how seeking divine wisdom leads not merely to spiritual enrichment but often results in material blessings as well. Conversely, pursuing superficial riches can lead to folly and spiritual emptiness.” (TheBiblesays.com on Prov. 16:16).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom should be your greatest treasure</u>. Solomon declared that those who understand and follow the treasures of Yahweh’s wisdom are blessed (Prov. 16:16; see also, 2:4-5; 3:3-15; 8:10-11). Job revealed that God’s wisdom is greater than any worldly treasure (Job 28:15-19). Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). “[I]n whom are hidden all the <em>treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes His wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To follow Jesus’ path of wisdom, stay on the narrow path of righteousness</u>. Jesus offers peace and refuge from evil if you follow His narrow, righteous path. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>The highway of the upright is to turn away from evil; one who watches his way protects his life</em>.” (Prov. 16:17). “The imagery of roads (‘highway’ and ‘way’) is used to motivate youth to choose ethical integrity. Dorsey explains the imagery: In Iron Age Israel (1100-600 B.C.), <em>the highway</em> was the main prepared thoroughfare and normally passed by cities, not through them. Those wishing to enter the city did so by ‘turning aside’ onto an access road (cf., Judg. 19:11, 12, 15). Here, the metaphor depicts the course of life <em>of the upright…</em> Those who do not deviate from piety and ethics by definition <em>turn aside from evil</em> (see 3:7; 14:16; 16:6), which implicitly likens evil to a condemned city (13:14-15; 15:24). By turning aside from the condemned cities, the upright stay on the unimpeded road to life. Verse 17b escalates the impersonal metaphor of a highway to the dynamic personal metaphor of a person on a journey. Like 2:8, 11, the verset puns on the synonyms ‘guard’ and ‘protect.’ <em>Those who guard their way</em> (see on 1:15) through great care <em>protect their life</em>.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 16:17).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Through prayer, the Word, and trust, Jesus will keep you on His narrow path</u>. David called upon God to make known the way of life: “You will make known to me the way of life; ....” (Ps. 16:11). “Make me know Your ways, LORD; teach me Your paths.” (Ps. 25:4). This requires prayer (Jam. 1:5). And it requires the study of the Word (Ps. 119:105). You must also trust God above your own instincts (Prov. 3:5-6). God further warns that only fools reject His narrow path leading to life. “A highway will be there, a roadway, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks that way, and fools will not wander on it.” (Is. 35:8). Jesus also warned that the path leading to eternal life is narrow. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14; Lk. 13:23-24).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Jesus’ sovereign authority may face judgment</u>. Pride will sadly cause many to rebel against Jesus’ authority in their lives. Unless they repent, they may face discipline or judgment. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling</em>.” (Prov. 16:18). “The phrase ‘Pride goes before destruction’ highlights the inevitable downfall that follows a prideful heart. Pride, in this context, refers to an inflated sense of self-importance and arrogance. The companion phrase, ‘a haughty spirit before a fall,’ reinforces this idea by illustrating that an arrogant attitude precedes disaster. Together, these phrases remind us that pride and arrogance set the state for failure and ruin.” (Reverend Michael Johnson, GodsBless.ing on Prov. 16:18).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus includes “hating” pride</u>.  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of all knowledge  (Prov. 1:7; 9:10; Ps. 111:10).  The fear of the Lord is defined as “hating” evil, which includes pride:  “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; <em>pride</em> and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.”  (Prov. 8:13; Ps. 97:10; Jam. 4:6; 1 Pet. 5;5; Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). The unsaved who are filled with pride and boasting will one day face God’s judgment (Prov. 16:18).  “A man’s pride will bring him low, . . .”  (Prov. 29:23). “The boastful will not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do injustice.” (Ps. 5:5). “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled,...” (Matt. 23:12). Satan is the father of pride.  His pride also caused his downfall.  He desired that others bow before him because of a blessing he did not earn (Is. 14:13-16).  When you are prideful, you are also under his influence. Instead, believers should imitate Jesus’ example. He humbled Himself and became a servant so that all might live (Phil. 2:7). “Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you” (Jam. 4:10).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who fear Jesus value humility and modesty over pride and wealth</u>.  If you accept that Jesus is your sovereign Lord, you will be humble and content. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>It is better to be humble in spirit with the needy than to divide the spoils with the proud</em>.” (Prov. 16:19). “Here again is a thrust made against that which God hates – pride. Pride is number one on God’s ‘hate parade’ (Prov. 6:16-19). This is the thing that brought down the archangel whom we know as Satan today … What was [his] sin? It was pride: he attempted to lift himself above God, because he was such a great creature whom God had created and given the power of free choice … where there is free choice, there is also the possibility of pride and rebellion against God.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 16:19).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will exalt the humble and humble the prideful</u>. If your faith in Jesus as your sovereign Lord prompts you to be humble, He will one day honor you. “A person’s pride will bring him low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”’ (Jam. 4:6). “You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” (1 Pet. 5:5). “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” (Lk. 14:11).</p></li>

<li><p><u>Trust in Jesus’ sovereign plan as revealed through His Word</u>. Because Jesus is sovereign, you can trust His Word to guide you. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>One who pays attention to the word will find good, and blessed is one who trusts in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Prov. 16:20). “These clauses are parallel. The man that heeds the Word of God is exactly the same man that trusts in Jehovah. A man can do neither without doing both. ‘There can be no real blessedness in life without one's trusting in the Lord. Men are so constituted that if their souls are to find rest, they must trust the loving power and wisdom of that Being who is stronger and wiser than themselves."’ (James Coffman’s Commentaries on the Bible, Prov. 16:20).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus promises to bless those who follow His Word</u>. If you have the faith to follow Jesus’ Word, He will bless your path. “Blessed are those who comply with His testimonies, and seek Him with all their heart.” (Ps. 119:2). “But He said, ‘On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it.”’ (Lk. 11:28). “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments … The one who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10). “for it is not the hearers of the Law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the Law who will be justified.” (Ro. 2:13). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves … But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the law of freedom, and has continued in it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.;” (Jam. 1:22, 25).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who study Jesus’ Word will be blessed</u>. In addition to blessing your path, Jesus wants you to bless others with the wisdom of His Word. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>The wise in heart will be called understanding, and sweetness of speech increases persuasiveness</em>.” (Prov. 16:21). “Wisdom is recognized, and where there is ability to impart it, it becomes helpful to others.” (G. Campbell Morgan’s Exposition on the Whole Bible, Prov. 16:21).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to speak His Words of life</u>. When you speak the wisdom of His Word to others in need, you speak righteousness and potentially bring life to the lost. “The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, but the perverted tongue will be cut out.” (Prov. 10:31). “The tongue of the wise makes knowledge pleasant, but the mouth of fools spouts foolishness.” (Prov. 15:2). “The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.” (Ps. 37:30). “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.” (Jam. 3:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers a fountain of life through the study of His Word</u>. The Word exposes your sins and guides your path. Only a fool rejects the wisdom Jesus offers in His Word. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it, but the discipline of fools is foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 16:22). “The phrase ‘fountain of life’ symbolizes the life-giving aspects of wisdom, suggesting that true understanding has the power to nourish and sustain our spirits. Conversely, the reference to the ‘instruction of fools’ hints at the negative consequences of failing to seek wisdom. It implies that ignoring instruction can lead one to folly and destruction.” (Christinanitypath.com on Prov. 16:22).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who are wise seek Jesus’ instruction and welcome His discipline</u>. If you fear Jesus, you will welcome the wisdom offered through His Word. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). “The beginning of wisdom is: acquire wisdom; and with all your possessions, acquire understanding.” (Prov. 4:7). “One who gets wisdom loves his own soul; one who keeps understanding will find good.” (Prov. 19:8; 2:6; Ecc. 7:12; Job 12:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who are wise use Jesus’ Word to bring wisdom and understanding to others</u>. If your heart is set on Jesus, you will show His love to others by sharing the wisdom of His Word. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>The heart of the wise instructs his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips</em>.” (Prov. 16:23). “The man that has studied the Word of God learns that his tongue can be a blessing or a curse. A blessing if controlled by words of wisdom, and a delight to those that come in contact with him.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 16:23).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who are wise use Jesus’ Word to bring life and encouragement</u>. With the power Jesus gives you, you can heal or create sorrow. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:21). “Words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious, while the lips of a fool consume him;” (Ecc. 10:12). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6). “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Use Jesus’ Word to heal and bring life</u>. With the Word, you can heal the brokenhearted. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones</em>.” (Prov. 16:24). “Honey took its place not only among the luxuries, but among the medicines of the Israelites. This two-fold use made it all the more suitable to be an emblem both of the true Wisdom which is also true obedience, and of the ‘pleasant words’ in which that Wisdom speaks.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 16:24).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be careful with your words so that you properly represent Jesus</u>. To accurately reflect the light of Jesus within you, speak His Words to bring healing. “There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.” (Prov. 12:18). “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit.” (Prov. 15:4). “Like apples of gold in settings of silver, is a word spoken at the proper time.” (Prov. 25:11). “But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, free of hypocrisy.” (Jam. 3:17).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ Word offers the path to life</u>. Only a fool rejects the wisdom offered in Jesus’ Word to find eternal life with Him. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death</em>.” (Prov. 16:25). “Every man thinks his way is right, because it feels and seems right. But God warns that such thinking leads to death. Most men are too in love with their opinions to change, even if the Bible condemns their thoughts to be sinful and self-destructive. There is only one criterion for truth and wisdom, and that is the will of God revealed in the Bible.” (LetGodbetrue.com on Prov.16:25).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers a narrow path to life through faith in Him</u>. For emphasis, Solomon repeated this proverb. “There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12). A person cannot rely upon their instincts to pick the right path because the heart is deceitful. “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). Jesus offers a narrow path that a person must diligently follow. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14). “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.” (Jo. 10:9; Acts 4:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus desires laborers who will hunger to share His Word</u>. Just as a person will work out of a desire to provide for his or her needs, Jesus desires laborers that will hunger to serve Him by sharing His Word. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>A worker’s appetite works for him, for his hunger urges him on</em>.” (Prov. 16:26). “Man is born for labor; it is a part of the curse inflicted on him for sin; and his condition and circumstances are such as make it necessary, for such who will not work ought not to eat; … It may be applied to Gospel ministers, who labor in the Lord's vineyard, in the word and doctrine; and though in the first place they labor to promote the glory of God and the interest of Christ, and the good of souls, yet it also turns to their own account; and indeed they labor to be accepted of the Lord, and at last shall hear, ‘Well done, good and faithful Servant; enter into the joy of thy Lord’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm"><u>Matthew 25:23</u></a>.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 16:26).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to use your talents to serve Him</u>. Solomon repeatedly urged believers to be diligent workers and avoid the sin of slothfulness (Prov. 10:4-5; 12:24; 13:4; 19:15; 20:4; 21:25; Ecc. 10:18). Jesus also warns against failing to use your spiritual gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30; 2 Thess. 3:10-12).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who accept that Jesus is sovereign fear Him by hating evil</u>. A “worthless person” rejects Jesus’ holy path and speaks evil words that cause harm to others. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>A worthless person digs up evil, while his words are like scorching fire</em>.” (Prov. 16:27). “This and the three following verses are concerned with the case of the evil man. An ungodly man - a man of Belial - diggeth up evil. A man of Belial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm"><u>Proverbs 6:12</u></a>) is a worthless, wicked person, what the French call a <strong>vaurien.</strong> Such a one digs a pit for others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm"><u>Proverbs 26:27</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm"><u>Psalm 7:15</u></a>), devises mischief against his neighbor, plots against him by lying and slandering and overreaching.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 16:27).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>To avoid evil, guard you heart and your tongue</u>. Those who fail to control their tongues can cause great harm. “And the tongue is a fire, the very world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our body’s parts as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.” (Jam. 3:6). “It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles the person.” (Matt. 15:11). “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37; Ps. 39:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Failing to control you tongue can also ruin your friendships</u>. When you fail to control your tongue, the people who are hurt first are frequently those closest to you. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>A perverse person spreads strife, and a slanderer separates close friends</em>.” (Prov. 16:28). “Twisted, <strong>perverse</strong> people love to sow <strong>strife</strong> the way a farmer sows seeds. When there is much strife, there is some <strong>perverse</strong> person sowing the strife … This is one way that the <strong>perverse man sows strife</strong> – by whispering gossipy words. The strife they sow is so powerful that it can separate <strong>the best of friends</strong>. Often, such people show they are <strong>perverse</strong> because they count it a victory and an accomplishment to sow such strife and to separate even <strong>the best of friends</strong>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 16:28).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Avoid the company of those who spread strife<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>With your tongue you can build up or rip apart relationships</u>. If you fail to control your tongue, you can crush people’s spirits. “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit.” (Prov. 15:4; Ps. 140:3). “So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, the very world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our body’s parts as that which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell. For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. But no one among mankind can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.” (Jam. 3:5-8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>An uncontrolled tongue can also lead people astray</u>. In addition to ruining relationships and crushing people’s spirits, you can also lead people to commit evil acts when you fail to control your tongue. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>A person of violence entices his neighbor and leads him in a way that is not good</em>.” (Prov. 16:29). “This verse speaks deeply about the nature of influence and how our actions can affect those around us. The ‘violent man’ mentioned is an individual who employs harmful tactics to sway others. This violence does not only refer to physical aggression, but it can also include manipulation, coercion, or any form of behavior that leads another person into wrongdoing. This passage warns us that the repercussions of one person’s bad influence can lead to negative paths for others as well. In essence, it serves as a reminder that our choices matter, and how we live our lives can either uplift others or lead them astray.” (ExplainingtheBible.com on Prov. 16:29).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Avoid the company of people who speak or engage in evil acts</u>. In addition to guarding your tongue, you must also watch your company to control your heart. “My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. If they say, ‘Come with us, let’s lie in wait for blood, let’s ambush the innocent without cause; let’s swallow them alive like Sheol, even whole, like those who go down to the pit;”’ (Prov. 1:10-12). “One who walks with wise people will be wise, but a companion of fools will suffer harm.” (Prov. 13:20). “Do not make friends with a person given to anger, or go with a hot-tempered person, or you will learn his ways and find a snare for yourself.” (Prov. 22:24-25). “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.”’ (1 Cor. 15:33; Ps. 1:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Avoid the company of people who are deceitful</u>. Selecting the right friends should include avoiding those who are openly deceitful in dealing with others. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>He who winks his eyes does so to devise perverse things; he who compresses his lips brings evil to pass</em>.” (Prov. 16:30). “The physiognomy of the man of Belial, the half-closed eyes that never look you straight in the face, the restlessness or cunning of which biting the lips is the surest indication.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 16:30).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>You will know which persons to avoid by their fruits</u>. A person is openly deceitful when they devise evil. “Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,…” (Prov. 12:20; Ps. 64:5-6). You will know a deceitful or evil person by their fruits. “You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, express any good things? For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart. The good person brings out of his good treasure good things; and the evil person brings out of his evil treasure evil things.” (Matt. 12:34-35). “For there is no good tree that bears bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree that bears good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush. The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.” (Lk. 6:43-45).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who fear Him and embrace righteousness</u>. Those who embrace Jesus’ wisdom will receive His blessings. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>A gray head is a crown of glory; it is found in the way of righteousness</em>.” (Prov. 16:31). “Proverbs 16:31 highlights the value of age and experience, encapsulated in the metaphor of ‘gray hair’ as a ‘crown of glory.’ This verse speaks to the respect and honor to those who have lived long and righteous lives. Gray hair in biblical times was a visible sign of wisdom and experience, often associated with a life well-lived.” (Reverend Michael Johnson, GodsBless.ing on Prov. 16:31).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who embrace Jesus’ wisdom will frequently gain honor and respect</u>. Those who have walked in Jesus’ wisdom for years will frequently become trusted advisors to others in need. “You shall stand up in the presence of the grayheaded and honor elders, and you shall fear your God; I am the LORD.” (Lev. 19:32). “Wisdom is with the aged, and with long life comes understanding.” (Job 12:12). “You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders;...” (1 Pet. 5:5). “Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father, …,” (1 Tim. 5:1). King Rehoboam committed a great sin that led to Israel’s division when he rejected the wise counsel of his elder advisors to instead accept the advice of young men who agreed with him (1 Kgs. 12:6-8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fear Jesus also control their anger</u>. Believers represent Jesus’ light. Thus, they must restrain themselves from lashing out in anger when they are upset. “<strong><sup>32 </sup></strong><em>One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and one who rules his spirit, than one who captures a city</em>.” (Prov. 16:32). “The long suffering, non-irascible man is more of a hero than the valiant commander of a great army. One overcomes external foes or obstacles; the other conquers himself;” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 16:32).<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Outside of narrow circumstances, those who fail to control their anger misrepresent Jesus</u>. While Jesus did show anger towards the religious leaders who led people astray, uncontrolled anger in most cases misrepresents the love and hope that Jesus offers, “for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Prov. 14:29). “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, for anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9). “Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.” (Matt. 5:5). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20). “So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so must you do also.” (Col. 3:12-13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>In all your actions, trust that Jesus is in control and avoid evil</u>. Part of fearing Jesus and avoiding evil is knowing that He is sovereign. “<strong><sup>33 </sup></strong><em>The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Prov. 16:33). “In other words, much that we attribute to chance is due to the providence of God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-29.htm"><u>Matthew 10:29-30</u></a>.) This should be an encouragement to trust in Him.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary on Prov. 16:33).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Trust that Jesus is full control and live a life that honors Him<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Honor Jesus with all your actions and trust that He is in control</u>. All authority has been given to Jesus. “And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.”’ (Matt. 28:18). Thus, you can trust that He is sovereign. “A man’s steps are ordained by the LORD; how then can a person understand his way?” (Prov. 20:24). “The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He pleases.” (Prov. 21:1). “The steps of a man are established by the LORD, and He delights in his way.” (Ps. 37:23). “The LORD has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all.” (Ps. 103:19). “I know, LORD, that a person’s way is not in himself, Nor is it in a person who walks to direct his steps.” (Jer. 10:23). This includes knowing that everything He does is for a greater good. “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</p></li>
