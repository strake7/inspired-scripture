<p><u>Introduction</u>: When Solomon became king, God blessed him and made him the wisest person on Earth: “Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.” (1 Kgs. 3:12b). Other leaders then came to hear his God-given wisdom. (2 Chr. 9:22-23). To share his God-given wisdom with everyone, Solomon also wrote three thousand proverbs. “He also told three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered 1,005.” (1 Kgs. 4:32). Some are recorded within the book of Proverbs.</p>
<p><u>Collections within Proverbs</u>. Proverbs include: (1) a prologue and an epilogue (Prov. 1:8-9:18), (2) Solomon’s proverbs (Prov. 10:1-29:27), and (3) Agur and Lemuel’s proverbs (Prov. 30:1- 31:31). From the whole counsel of God, Proverbs reveals several lessons about true wisdom.</p>
<p>1) <u>True wisdom comes from Jesus</u>. As part of the prologue to Proverbs, Solomon made clear that true wisdom comes from Yahweh: “<em>For the LORD gives wisdom</em>; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). The New Testament reveals our God-given wisdom comes through Jesus. “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, <em>who became to us wisdom from God</em>, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus also revealed that the entire Old Testament is about Him (Lk. 24:44). His wisdom is a gift that comes from knowing Him as your Lord and Savior. “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, <em>may give you a spirit of wisdom</em> and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.” (Eph. 1:17). His wisdom seeks to bring every person’s life into harmony with His originally intended order.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>2) <u>True wisdom includes both fearing Jesus and being an imitator of His righteousness</u>. The prologue to Proverbs also begins with Solomon’s revelation that “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction</em>.” (Prov. 1:7). The fear of Yahweh is defined as “hating” what He calls evil (Prov. 8:13). Some of the many examples include many avoiding evil (Prov. 2:14-18), avoiding evil companions (Prov. 1:10-19; 4:17; 23:6-8; 27:19), avoid drunkenness (Prov. 20:1; 31:5), controlling one’s tongue (Prov. 10:19-20; 11:9; 11:13; 13:3; 15:1,4; 17:9), avoiding unfair business practices (Prov. 11:1; 16:11; 20:10), honoring your marriage (Prov. 11:29; 14:1; 19:13; 21:19), having self-control (Prov. 16:32; 25:8), and having integrity (Prov. 2:7). Others describe the fear of Yahweh as a reverent respect and submission that is rooted in a love for Him. “The fear of the LORD is that affectionate reverence, by which the child of God bends himself humbly and carefully to his Father’s law.” (Charles Bridges on Proverbs).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Isaiah declared that the promised Messiah would fulfill these definitions. “The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom</em> and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, <em>the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD</em>.” (Is. 11:2). Without the fear of the Lord, a person’s sinful desires can overpower their God-given wisdom and knowledge. Thus, a person who fears God also guards his or her heart (Prov. 4:23). Solomon’s failure to guard his heart later led to his idolatry and other serious sins. His failures also likely prompted him to write the book of Ecclesiastes. The fear of the Lord should then lead to a believer to seek to be “sanctified” by an “imitator” of Jesus’ righteousness (Eph. 5:1).</p>
<p>3) <u>True wisdom must be sought out through the Word, prayer, and Spirit-led counsel</u>. Proverbs also begins with a call for people to hear and respond to the call of Yahweh’s wisdom: “<em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Wisdom shouts in the street, she raises her voice in the public square.</em>” (Prov. 1:20). In the New Testament, Paul also calls upon everyone to search out and follow Jesus’ wisdom instead of worldly wisdom. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Yet we do speak <em>wisdom</em> among those who are mature; <em>a wisdom</em>, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>but we speak <em>God’s wisdom</em> in a mystery, <em>the hidden</em> <em>wisdom</em> which God predestined before the ages to our glory; <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>the wisdom</em> which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;” (1 Cor. 2:6-8). Jesus is the Word and wisdom who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). Beginning at least at age 12, Jesus taught and “amazed” people with His wisdom (Lk. 2:41-52). He continued to teach wisdom until He was crucified. Today, He seeks your fellowship (Rev. 3:20). When you read His Word, His wisdom is a light that guides your path (Ps. 119:105). The Holy Spirit will also “teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26). Jesus’ wisdom is further available when you pray and ask Him for it. “But <em>if any of you lacks wisdom</em>, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). As long as it does not conflict with the Word, Jesus can also use the counsel of godly people to share His wisdom with you (e.g, Prov. 11:14; 12:15; 15:22). As two commentators conclude, “Thus, as Christians read the book of Proverbs in the light of the continued revelation of the New Testament, they are confronted with the same questions as the ancient Israelites, but with a different nuance.  Will we dine with Wisdom or with Folly?  The Wisdom who beckons us is none other than Jesus Christ, while the folly that attempts to seduce is any created thing that we put in place of the Creator (<a href="https://ref.ly/Rom.1.22-23;kjv1900?t=biblia">Rom.1:22-23</a>).” (Raymond Dillard and Tremper Longman on Proverbs).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>4) <u>True wisdom should also be taught and followed within families and communities</u>. Israel was God’s “kingdom of priests” (Exod. 19:6). This meant that every person had a role in sharing God’s wisdom. Because no schools existed in Old Testament times, instruction regarding wisdom began within the families. Moses commanded parents to teach their children the Ten Commandments and the interpretive rules in the home (Dt. 6:7-9). In Proverbs, children are urged to follow the godly instruction of their parents (Prov. 1:8-9; 6:20: 10:1). This also means that God meant for families to study the Word together. Godly instruction also extended to communities (Dt. 6:4). Jesus came to fulfill God’s Word, including the Law, all prophecy, and offer salvation (Matt. 5:17). To save the lost, Jesus shared His wisdom through His teachings (Mk. 1:21-22, 6:6). His wisdom teachings included His parables (e.g., Matt. 13:13). The Greek word “parabole” (παραβολή) is a translation of the Hebrew word “mashal” (<span dir="rtl">מָשָׁל</span>) or “proverb”.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> He taught wisdom parables to the crowds (Matt 13:10-17). But he revealed their hidden meanings to His disciples (Matt. 13:11). Jesus also wants you to become His disciple (Lk. 9:23). If you will search out what He offers, He will share His wisdom with you. “It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.” (Prov. 25:2).</p>
<p>5) <u>True wisdom trusts in God to fulfill every promise in His perfect timing</u>. If the book of Proverbs were viewed as a legal document, it would best be interpreted as “God’s principles” or “statements of intent” without the full Covenant terms or God’s exceptions to His principles. In other words, the individual promises in Proverbs must never be read in isolation. For example, Solomon declared:  “The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, but He will reject the craving of the wicked.”  (Prov. 10:3).  “The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, but the stomach of the wicked is in need.”  (Prov. 13:25).  “One who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like the green leaf.”  (Prov. 11:28).  “A faithful man will abound with blessings, . . .”  (Prov. 28:20(a)).  The psalms are also filled with similar claims (Ps. 37:25; Ps. 1:3).  Finally, even Jesus promised that a faithful person who seeks to do His will and live according to His righteousness, will receive His provision (Matt. 6:33). There are, however, many righteous believers who have lived with chronic food insecurity. Some have even suffered starvation. Many wicked people have also enjoyed abundant wealth and have never wanted. The book of Job comes before the book of Proverbs to explain these paradoxes. God is sovereign (Prov. 16:9). Even though His intent is to bless the righteous, He may delay a blessing or a judgment as part of His perfect plan (Ro. 8:28). A blessing at the wrong time might allow someone to drift from God or refuse to depend upon Him. Conversely, a withheld judgment may be meant to give sinners a chance to repent (2 Pet. 3:9). Thus, a proverb promising a blessing should never be viewed as a contractual promise that a believer can demand in his or her timing. If a promise is not fulfilled on Earth, it will be fulfilled in heaven. Jesus is faithful (Rev. 19:11).</p>
<p>6) <u>True wisdom requires that you approach God with the right attitude</u>. God cares deeply about each person’s heart. Therefore, many proverbs emphasize the mindset one should have when seeking God’s wisdom. First, believers must place their trust in God alone (Prov. 3:5–6; 16:20; 29:25). Second, they must be humble and free from pride (Prov. 11:2; 22:4). Third, they must submit to God and be willing to accept godly correction (Prov. 9:8; 13:24; 27:17). Fourth, their motivation must be rooted in their love for God and others (Prov. 10:12; Matt. 22:27; Dt. 6:5).</p>
<p>7) <u>True wisdom can bring God’s blessings upon your relationships</u>. When Moses gave the Ten Commandments, he stated that faith-led obedience could lead to certain types of blessings in God’s timing (Lev. 26:1-13; Dt. 28:1-14). Derek Kidner observes that Proverbs complements God’s Law and the prophets’ teachings by helping believers to live in harmonious relationships. “There are details of character small enough to escape the mesh of the Law and the broadsides of the prophets, and yet decisive in personal dealings. Proverbs moves in this realm, asking what a person is like to live with, or to employ; how he manages his affairs, his time and himself.” (Derek Kidner on Proverbs).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The blessings that Jesus offers through faith-led obedience to His Proverbs are primarily spiritual and not material. He offers blessings through a right relationship with Him and others around you. As two scholars conclude, “Proverbs is a ‘how to be book, not a ‘how to get’ book.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="chapter-1-lessons-regarding-the-true-wisdom-that-jesus-offers"><strong>Chapter 1: Lessons Regarding the True Wisdom That Jesus Offers</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Chapter one begins Solomon’s prologue (Prov. 1:8-8:36). Here, Solomon offers believers lessons regarding the true wisdom that Yahweh alone offers. Yahweh is another name for the great “I AM”. In the New Testament, Jesus reveals that He is the I AM of the Old Testament (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Jesus is also wisdom personified (1 Cor. 1:30). His wisdom: (1) is available with a receptive heart, (2) when you fear Him, (3) when you obey godly instruction, (4) when you separate yourself from evil, (5) but it calls for your repentance, (6) it brings discipline when you ignore it, but (7) it offers a path for Jesus to bless you when you follow it.</p>

<p>Jesus is wisdom incarnate<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><u>First</u>, Solomon promised that Yahweh’s wisdom and instruction are available to all who receive it with a receptive heart. Today, Jesus’ wisdom is also freely available to all with an open heart to the instruction offered through His Word, prayer, and the Holy Spirit. <u>Second</u>, as a foundational premise to Proverbs, Solomon revealed that the beginning of all knowledge and wisdom starts with the fear of Yahweh. This means hating evil (Prov. 8:13). You will persevere in Jesus’ wisdom if you have a reverent love for Him that includes hating what He calls evil. <u>Third</u>, Solomon urged his son to obey godly instruction. Receiving and maintaining Jesus’ wisdom also requires families to teach His wisdom and for children to obey it. <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon also urged his son to avoid the company of those who might tempt him to commit sins against Yahweh. Maintaining your walk in Jesus’ wisdom also requires that you separate yourself from persons living in rebellion against Him. <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon stated that Yahweh’s wisdom calls for all to turn away from the sin. Jesus’ wisdom also includes a call to repentance. <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon warned that those who fail to listen to Yahweh’s wisdom are fools who will one day experience judgment. Those who refuse to accept the wisdom of Jesus’ call to repentance will also face discipline and eventual judgment. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon promised a blessing for those who follow Yahweh’s wisdom and fear Him. Jesus will also bless those who follow the wisdom He offers.</p>

Prov. 1:1-6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Be receptive to Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Until Jesus took human form, Solomon was the wisest person to ever live (1 Kgs. 3:12b). He began his teachings on wisdom with a promise that an open mind and a receptive heart would allow any believer to receive the blessing of Yahweh’s wisdom and knowledge. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>To know wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding, <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>to receive instruction in wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and integrity; <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>to give prudence to the naive, to the youth knowledge and discretion, <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>a wise person will hear and increase in learning, and a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel, <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles</em>.” (Prov. 1:1-6). “It is helpful to remember the difference between <strong>wisdom</strong> and <em>knowledge</em>. One may have knowledge without wisdom. Knowledge is the collection of facts; <strong>wisdom</strong> is the right use of what we know for daily living. Knowledge can tell one how financial systems work; <strong>wisdom</strong> manages a budget properly…<strong>To receive the instruction of wisdom</strong>: Proverbs is something of a school of wisdom. We come to it with open hearts and minds, receiving its teaching. If we do, it will show as <strong>justice, judgment, and equity</strong> flow from our lives.” (David Guzik on Prov. 1:2-3) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>True wisdom is found in Jesus’ Word, prayer, and the Spirit</u>. Paul stated that Jesus’ wisdom was beyond his ability to find it on his own (Ro. 11:33-34). But Paul revealed that God’s wisdom is made known to us through faith in Jesus Christ: “that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and that they would attain to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God’s mystery, that is, Christ Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” (Col. 2:2-3). “To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, . . . so that the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 3:8, 10). Jesus is the Word and wisdom who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14; 1 Cor. 1:30). He will freely give you His wisdom when you read his Word (Ps. 119:105), pray (Jam. 1:5), and submit to the Spirit (Jo. 14:26).</p></li>
<li><p><u>True wisdom is available when you have an open and receptive heart</u>. Because of their sins, Yahweh called His people “obstinate” (Ex. 33:6 NASB) or “stiff-necked (NKV/ NIV). In the New Testament, believers are called upon to “purify their hearts” and not to be double minded between the things of God and the world. “Come close to God and He will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (Jam. 4:8). Jesus’ wisdom is freely available when you cleanse your heart of your worldly beliefs and search for Him with your whole undivided heart. “And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>True wisdom leads to knowledge, but knowledge is not required to receive God</u>. For those with an open heart“<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>to receive instruction</em>” regarding God’s wisdom, God will “<em><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>give prudence to the naive, to the youth knowledge and discretion,</em>” (Prov. 1:3-4). In other words, you don’t need a seminary degree or even a college degree to receive God’s wisdom. You only need an open heart to receive what Jesus freely offers. As one commentator observes, “Friend, you may not be brilliant, but when you receive Christ and come to know Christ, then you have wisdom.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 1:2-4).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>

Prov. 1:7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fear of the LORD allows you to persevere in following the wisdom that He offers</u>. A receptive mind and heart are necessary but not sufficient conditions to receive and maintain Jesus’ wisdom in your life. For Jesus’ wisdom to endure, you need a reverent love where you “hate” what Jesus defines as evil and love what He defines as good. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction</em>.” (Prov. 1:7). This statement is the lens through which the entire book of Proverbs must be interpreted. “<em>Beginning of knowledge</em> refers to the epistemological foundation of Proverbs. What the alphabet is to reading, what notes are to music, what numerals are to mathematics, the fear of I AM is to gaining the book’s <em>wisdom and instruction</em>.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Some also believe that this revelation forms a literary marker that divides the book of Proverbs into three sections (1-9; 10-29; 30-31) (Craig Bartholomew and Ryan O’Dowd on Proverbs).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon squandered His God-given wisdom because He lost His fear of Yahweh</u>. Even though God blessed Solomon with greater wisdom and wealth than any other person (1 Kgs. 4:29-34; 10:23), Solomon misused God’s blessings and committed several deadly sins. <em>First</em>, he took 1,000 wives, including 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kgs. 11:3-4). He violated God’s law that he have only one wife 999 times (Dt. 17:17). More importantly, his many wives, especially his pagan ones, turned his heart against God (1 Kgs. 11:4). <em>Second,</em> because of his foreign wives, Solomon began to worship other gods (1 Kgs. 11:5-6). This violated God’s First Commandment (Ex. 20:2-3; Dt. 5:6-7). His foreign wives also led him to build idols and pagan altars for the Jews to worship the pagan gods like Chemosh and Molech (1 Kgs. 11:5-8). This also violated God’s Second Commandment (Ex. 20:4-6; Dt. 5:8-10). <em>Third</em>, to become king, Solomon would have taken an oath to obey God’s laws. His failure to follow his oath as the King of Israel blasphemed God’s holy name (Lev. 19:12). This violated God’s Third Commandment (Ex. 20:7; Dt. 5:11). <em>Fourth</em>, by worshipping other gods and stumbling generations of Jews to do the same, Solomon dishonored both his father David and God the Father. This violated God’s Fifth Commandment (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). <em>Fifth</em>, Solomon tried to kill his servant Jeroboam after the prophet Ahijah told Solomon that God would give Jeroboam 10 of the 12 tribes for Solomon’s rebellions (1 Kgs. 11:40). In addition to being another form of rebellion against God, this violated God’s Sixth Commandment (Ex. 20:13; Dt. 5:17). <em>Sixth</em>, Solomon hoarded gold and wives out of covetousness. This violated God’s Tenth Commandment (Ex. 20:17; Dt. 5:21). <em>Finally</em>, because his heart grew hard, he refused to listen to the prophet Ahijah’s warnings that Solomon’s sins would lead to the division of Israel (1 Kgs. 11:9-13). Just as Solomon’s heart was divided between God and the world, so was Israel. Thus, Solomon’s life shows that wisdom and knowledge are not enough to maintain your walk with God. You also need the fear of Yahweh.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Reverent fear in the form of avoiding evil leads to the blessing of enduring wisdom</u>. After observing the mistakes in his own life, Solomon formed the Spirit-led foundational truth for the entire book Proverbs. “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge</em>; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom</em>, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10). An unknown psalmist later repeated Solomon’s revelation that, “<em>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;</em>” (Ps. 111:10). The prophet Samuel also urged believers in his farewell address to fear Yahweh: “<em>Only fear the LORD and serve Him in truth with all your heart</em>; for consider what great things He has done for you.” (1 Sam. 12:24). Fearing the Lord is defined in the Bible as “hating” what God calls evil (Prov. 8:13). Thus, if you fear God by avoiding what He calls evil, He offers the blessing of true, enduring wisdom.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Only fools reject Jesus’ free gift of wisdom</u>. Solomon further warned that “<em>fools despise wisdom and instruction</em>.” (Prov. 1:7b). This warning applies to both formal atheists and casual believers who reject the authority of Jesus’ Word as sovereign and controlling over their lives. “To confirm this truth, that an eye to God must both direct and quicken all our pursuits of knowledge, he <em>observes, Fools</em> (atheists, who have no regard to God) <em>despise wisdom and instruction;</em> having no dread at all of God's wrath, nor any desire of his favor, they will not give you thanks for telling them what they may do to escape his wrath and obtain his favor. Those who say to the Almighty, <em>Depart from us,</em> who are so far from fearing him that they set him at defiance, can excite no surprise if they desire not the knowledge of his ways, but despise that instruction. Note, Those are fools who do not fear God and value the scriptures; and though they may pretend to be admirers of wit they are really strangers and enemies to wisdom.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 1:7b).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>

Prov. 1:8-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Heeding Spirit-led parenting leads to wisdom</u>. To both his own son (possibly his heir Rehoboam) and as an example to other children, Solomon urged his son to listen to the godly counsel of his parents. “<em><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not ignore your mother’s teaching; <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>for they are a graceful wreath for your head and necklaces for your neck</em>.” (Prov. 1:8-9). ‘“The instruction of the father,’ and ‘the law of the mother’ are to be accepted with childlike submission and unquestioning obedience, and will lend grace and dignity to the life and character, because and in so far as they are the instruction and the law of God Himself, the Universal Father, and because parents are His vicegerents in the education of their children (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20-21</a>). And every true teacher is, in measure and degree, His and their deputy and representative.” (Thomas Thomason Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Prov. 1:8-9).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The fear of Jesus includes obedience</u>. Solomon later exhorted everyone that the fear of God includes obedience: “The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is: <em>fear God and keep His commandments</em>, <em>because this applies to every person</em>.” (Ecc. 12:13). Moses also proclaimed that fearing God includes a desire to obey out of obedience. “And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to <em>fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways and love Him</em>, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,” (Dt. 10:12). Job was “blameless” because his reverent fear of God led him to always obey: “There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, <em>fearing God</em> <em>and turning away from evil.</em>” (Job 1:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rehoboam’s failure to heed Solomon’s wisdom</u>. Sadly, Rehoboam refused to obey or fear Yahweh when he became king. His evil and misguided reign even led to the breakup of Israel into two nations. Upon becoming king, he responded to the people’s complaints about Solomon’s taxation and work requirements by threatening to punish the people with labor and tax requirements far worse than anything that Solomon had imposed (1 Kgs. 12:12-15). Rehoboam’s threats allowed Jeroboam to incite the northern tribes into breaking away to form a separate kingdom (1 Kgs. 12:16-20). Despite knowing that the division of Israel was God’s punishment for Solomon’s idolatry (1 Kgs. 11:11, 35), Rehoboam failed to lead the nation into repentance. Instead, he tried and failed to stop God’s prophecy from coming true by using his army to brutally impose his will (1 Kgs. 12:21-24). Rehoboam also sinned by taking 18 wives when God allowed only one. Thus, it is not enough for children to hear godly parental wisdom. They must also obey it.</p></li>
<li><p><u>In order for children to obey godly instruction, parents must first teach it</u>. Solomon’s exhortation only has meaning within the context of God’s Word. As beneficiaries of God’s Law, the Jews were obligated to teach it to their children and grandchildren. They were further to look for teaching moments wherever they arose: “You shall teach them to your sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up.” (Dt. 11:19). “You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.” (Dt. 6:7). “. . . but make them known to your sons and your grandsons.” (Dt. 4:9). “ . . . and that they may teach their children.’” (Dt. 4:10; Prov. 22:6; Ps. 78:4-6). In case any Christian feels freed of this requirement, Paul is clear that it still applies: “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Eph. 6:4). Do you know God’s law well enough to teach it? Do you teach your children God’s law?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Reverent obedience and fearing Jesus should be based upon your love for Him</u>. Jesus says that if you love Him, you will keep His “Commandments” (Jo. 14:15, 21; 15:10; 1 Jo. 5:3; 2 Jo. 1:6; Matt. 19:17). He again is the great “I AM” who gave Moses the Ten Commandments  (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). Thus, any time the Bible uses the word “LORD” it is a substitute for the name Yahweh. Because Jesus is Yahweh and the author of the Ten Commandments, He is entitled to reverent fear. But He came to correct people’s motives in following the Ten Commandments.  He wants your obedience to be motivated by love and not obligation.  He therefore summarized the Ten Commandments as something that comes naturally once a person loves the LORD and his or her neighbor (Matt. 22:35-38; Lk. 10:27; Dt. 6:5).  Moses taught us to live obediently as it is written.  Jesus taught us to love obediently as it is written.  Whether you keep the Ten Commandments out of love (and not obligation) is also the test regarding whether you really “know” Jesus:  “By this we know that we have come to <em>know</em> Him, if we keep His commandments.”  (1 Jo. 2:3).  Some will come to Jesus boasting of their works or compliance with the Law.  But if their works or their compliance with the Law was not motivated by a love for Him, He may respond “I never <em>knew</em> you.”  (Matt. 7:23). If you obey the Law for the right reasons, you become a slave to righteousness.  But if you do not obey the Law, you are likely to become a slave to sin (Ro. 6:12, 16; Jo. 8:34). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is not your Lord if you refuse to do what He says</u>. When your faith does not produce the fruit of obedience, it is time to examine your heart: “Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” (Jam. 2:17). A believer may proclaim Jesus as Lord. But He is not your Lord if you disobey Him: “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?” (Lk. 6:46). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24). “Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” (Matt. 7:26). Jesus also warned: “For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:14). Is your faith evidenced through obedience to Jesus’ Word?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Separate yourself from unholy influences</u>. Solomon warned his son to avoid persons living in rebellion against God who might tempt him to sin. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>If they say, ‘Come with us, let’s lie in wait for blood, let’s ambush the innocent without cause; <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Let’s swallow them alive like Sheol, even whole, like those who go down to the pit; <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We will find all kinds of precious wealth, we will fill our houses with plunder; <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>throw in your lot with us; we will all have one money bag,’ <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>my son, do not walk on the way with them. Keep your feet from their path, <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>for their feet run to evil, and they are quick to shed blood. <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net in the sight of any bird; <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>but they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Such are the ways of everyone who makes unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors</em>.” (Prov. 1:10-19). “The first great danger which besets the simple and the young is that of evil companionship. The only safety is to be found in the power of saying ‘No,’ to all such invitations.” (Albert Barnes, Notes on the Bible, Prov. 1:10).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Bad company can pull you off your walk</u>. The Bible clearly warns: “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.”’ (1 Cor. 15:33). “Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers!” (Ps. 1:1). “He who begins with his own heart begins at the fountain head, and is not likely to tolerate evil companions.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 101:5).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> If you spend your free time with people who reject God’s Word, they may corrupt your walk.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be holy because Jesus is holy</u>. Yahweh repeatedly called for His people to “consecrate” themselves by being holy: ‘“For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy.”’ (Lev. 11:44). ‘“Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.”’ (Lev. 19:2). “You are to be my holy people.” (Ex. 22:31). These instructions also apply to Christians: “for it is written: ‘Be holy, because I am holy.’” (1 Pet. 1:16). “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Cor. 7:1).</p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-1/media/image4.jpg" style="width:6.04956in;height:3.95339in" alt="1 Peter 1:16 because it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”" /></p>
<p>Walk in Jesus’ wisdom by resisting temptation and remaining holy for His use<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Put on the armor of God to resist temptation</u>.  Guarding your heart from people who might induce you to sin requires that you put on the armor of God:  “Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.”  (Eph. 6:11).  “The night is almost gone, and the day is near.  Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.”  (Ro. 13:12).  Jesus has also left you with His Word as a sword against the devil. “For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.”  (Heb. 4:12).  Are you using each part of God’s armor against the devil?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t turn to people living in rebellion for advice</u>. Solomon later revealed that true wisdom comes from God alone: “For the LORD gives wisdom; <em>from His mouth come knowledge and understanding</em>.” (Prov. 2:6). The psalmists also knew that true wisdom comes from God. “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in secret You will make wisdom known to me.” (Ps. 51:6). Job also proclaimed that wisdom comes from God: “Wisdom and might are with Him; advice and understanding belong to Him.” (Job 12:13). God also affirmed to Job that all wisdom comes from Him: “Who has put wisdom in the innermost being, or given understanding to the mind?” (Job 38:36). Solomon could not find true wisdom through his own efforts: “I tested all this with wisdom, and I said, ‘I will be wise,’ but wisdom was far from me. What has been is remote and very mysterious. Who can discover it?” (Ecc. 7:23-24). If the wisest man on Earth could not find true wisdom without God, nor can someone living in open rebellion.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Even when the world thinks it foolish, God wants you to rely upon His wisdom</u>. Even if it is unpopular and you are mocked, God wants you to only rely upon His wisdom. “For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Cor. 1:18; 2:14). His wisdom is the truth that will set you free (Jo. 8:32). Thus, you should ignore the temptations and advice that sinners offer you.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repentance-jesus-wisdom-includes-a-call-to-repentance.-prov.-120-23."><strong>5). <u>Repentance: Jesus’ Wisdom Includes a Call to Repentance</u>. Prov. 1:20-23.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus, through the Spirit, makes His wisdom known to anyone who seeks Him</u>. Solomon stated that God’s wisdom calls out for everyone to follow His call and “turn” to His rebuke. “<em><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Wisdom shouts in the street, she raises her voice in the public square; <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>At the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the gates in the city she declares her sayings: <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>‘How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking? And how long will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing and fools hate knowledge? <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Turn to my rebuke, behold, I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you</em>.” (Prov. 1:20-23). “Having shown the counsels and invitations of folly and of wicked men, he now declares the voice of wisdom. The Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">חכמות</span>, rendered <em>wisdom </em>here, is in the plural number, and is literally <em>wisdoms. </em>It was probably intended to include various kinds, or, rather, all the kinds of Wisdom 1 st, The works of creation, (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-6</a>,) the light and law of nature, the dispensations of divine providence, the human understanding, are wisdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-36.htm">Job 38:36</a>. By these God speaks to the children of men, and reasons with them;” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on the Bible, Prov. 1:20-23).<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus, the personification of wisdom, calls upon everyone to repent</u>. Wisdom’s call in Proverbs 1:20-23 cannot be divorced from its preceding verses. Wisdom cries out to the wayward Prodigal son in Proverbs 1 who ignored the Father’s warnings not to embrace sin. Wisdom calls upon the Prodigal son to “<em>Turn to my rebuke,</em>” (Prov. 1:23) or “repent” (Prov. 1:23). This again foreshadows Jesus. Jesus began His ministry with a universal call to repentance. “From that time Jesus began to preach and say, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”’  (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus came “saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”’  (Mk. 1:15).  His disciples also began their ministry with a call to repentance:  “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”’  (Acts 2:38).  If you confess your sins, Jesus will forgive you: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 Jo. 1:9). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus was crucified at the cross and now cries out to sinners because He loves everyone</u>. Out of love, Jesus died a brutal death at the cross so that everyone could be saved (Jo. 3:16). He now cries out with His wisdom to save all sinners. “How wonderful to know that God always gives us a way to escape when the wicked one tries to destroy us. When the sinner tries to snare you, wisdom cries out to save you from the fall. When a person knows the wisdom of God, it will go with him or her wherever they go, and warn them of the mistake they are about to make.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 1:20).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon spoke of the Holy Spirit</u>. For those who repent, Yahweh promised that He “<em>will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you</em>.” (Prov. 1:23). The prophet Joel later repeated this promise. “It will come about after this that <em>I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;</em> and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, your young men will see visions.” (Joel 2:28). Isaiah also repeated this promise. ‘“For I will pour water on the thirsty land and streams on the dry ground; <em>I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring</em>, and My blessing on your descendants;” (Is. 44:3). Peter later connected these multiple prophecies to the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:17-18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’s wisdom, in coordination with the Holy Spirit, is available to all who repent</u>. For two reasons, some object to connecting Jesus in these verses. First, Proverbs 1:20-23 refers to wisdom with the female gender “she” and “her” (Prov. 1:20-21). But Solomon’s reference to wisdom by the female gender is a construct of Hebrew grammar. In Hebrew, wisdom or “chokhmah” (<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>) is grammatically feminine.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The female nature of the word also underscores the desirability of God’s Wisdom. “She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her.” (Prov. 3:15). In Proverbs 8, wisdom is called a “master <em>workman</em>;” (Prov. 8:30). Thus, Jesus is a man. Second, some argue that wisdom in Proverbs 8 appears to reference being “born” when everything was created: “<strong><sup>22</sup></strong> <em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> created me</em> at the beginning of His way, before His works of old.” (Prov. 8:22). The philosopher Arius (256-336) relied upon Proverbs 8:22 and Colossians 1:15 to teach the ancient heresy of “Arianism”. He taught that Jesus was not coeternal with God the Father.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> Yet, for several reasons, this is a heresy. <em>First</em>, multiple other verses make clear that Jesus is eternal, and He created all things (Heb. 1:1-2; 13:8; Jo. 1:1-4, 10; 8:58; Rev. 1:8; 3:14). <em>Second</em>, wisdom came from Jesus as a part of Him. The word “LORD” is the English interpretation of Yahweh. This is another name for the great “I AM.” As stated above, Jesus is the great I AM “Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was born, <em>I am</em>.”’ (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). <em>Third</em>, Solomon’s choice of Hebrew words made clear that Jesus summoned the wisdom within Himself instead of creating something from nothing. The words in English “<em>created me</em>” come from the Hebrew word “qā·nā·nî” (<span dir="rtl">קָ֭נָנִי</span>). This word appears 85 times in the Bible. In none of the usages of this word is something created from nothing. It more commonly means “to procure, by purchase, to own” and then bring the item forth. As one example, “the field which Abraham purchased (“qā·nā·nî” (<span dir="rtl">קָ֭נָנִי</span>)) from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.” (Gen. 25:10; see also Gen. 33:19; 47:19-20; 49:30; 50:13; Ex. 15:16; 21:2; Lev. 22:11; 25:14-15, 28, 30, 44, 45, 50; 27:24; Dt. 28:68; 32:6; Josh. 24:32; Ruth 4:4-5, 8-10; 2 Sam. 12:3; 24:21).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Jesus paid the price at the cross to share His wisdom leading to salvation (Jo. 3:16; 1 Pet. 2:22-25). <em>Fourth,</em> if Solomon wanted to convey that wisdom was created from nothing, he would have used the Hebrew word “bā·rā” (<span dir="rtl">בָּרָ֣א</span>) as that term appears in Genesis 1:1.<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <em>Fifth</em>, if Yahweh were to be considered God the Father and if He “created” wisdom for the first time with Jesus as this false doctrine teaches, then God the Father did not have access to true wisdom before Jesus. It allegedly came into being with Jesus. But this would be an absurd interpretation. <em>Sixth</em>, wisdom in this poem becomes the “representation” of Jesus the same way His printed Word in the Bible “represents” the eternal Word that became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). This is made clear in the same chapter of Proverbs: “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.” (Prov. 8:12). There is not a separate divine being called “prudence” who is dwelling with Jesus. <em>Finally</em>, although church leaders can make mistakes, this has been the united view of the Church since the first Counsel of Nicaea resolved this exact issue in 325 AD. Among the great church fathers to resolve the issue, the Greek philosopher Justin Marty (circa 100-165 A.D.) taught that the wisdom personified in Proverbs referred to Jesus Christ. But one accepted minority view came from the Greek Bishop Irenaeus of Lyon (circa 130 – 202 A.D.) He believed that these verses instead referenced to the Holy Spirit.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> He pointed out that the Holy Spirit created with Jesus (Gen. 1:2). But the Triune God works together as one.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is preeminent over all creation</u>. In Colossians 1:15, Jesus is called “the firstborn of all creation.” But this does not mean that Jesus was the first to be “born” as Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons believe. Instead, “firstborn” means “preeminent one.”<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> In Exodus, Yahweh referred to Israel as His “firstborn”. “Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: “<em>Israel is My son, My firstborn</em>.”’ (Ex. 4:22). God did not give “birth” to Israel. Instead, like Jesus, it had a preeminent honor. Thus, these verses are all meant to stress Jesus’ preeminent role is bringing forth His wisdom for mankind.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Diligently read Jesus’ Word and pray for His wisdom</u>. Like wisdom shouting in the street, Jesus’ wisdom is there when you look for it. But you must diligently read His Word and pray for His wisdom to be revealed to you: “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). “For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in secret You will make wisdom known to me.” (Ps. 51:6). “For to a person who is good in His sight, He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, . ..” (Ecc. 2:26). When you pray and submit to Jesus, the Holy Spirit will guide your path and reveal His wisdom to you: “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13). “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:16). God wants you to seek His guidance through prayer and the Word. “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19). Do you pray and read the Word when you need wisdom?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Diligence requires daily prayer and reading the Word</u>. The search for God’s wisdom does not end until you get to heaven. Just as the Jews had to turn every day to God in the wilderness for their mana, you must turn daily to God through prayer and reading the Word to find how His wisdom applies to the changing needs of your life. “Evening and morning and at noon, I will complain and moan, and He will hear my voice.” (Ps. 55:17). You must also listen and apply the wisdom that God provides: “The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, So that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.” (Is. 50:4). Are you reading the Word and praying every day so that God can guide you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for the wisdom to stay on God’s path</u>. David prayed for God’s wisdom to stay on His path. “<em>Teach me Your way</em>, LORD; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.” (Ps. 86:11). In contrast, Solomon misused his God-given wisdom for his own glory. Thus, you should always pray for God’s wisdom to guide you on His path.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Share Jesus’ wisdom with others</u>. Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). He proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes God’s wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44). That means that you can share Jesus’ wisdom merely by sharing the Word and encouraging those who hear it to believe. There are many people who are searching for treasures in the wrong places. Many of these people are lost in darkness. Are you sharing the Word as part of Jesus’ Great Commission (Matt. 28:16-20)?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Continually seek out Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Jesus also wants you to continually seek out His wisdom as your greatest treasure: “Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.” (1 Chr. 16:11). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.” (Ps. 51:6). “Seek the LORD so that you may live, . . .” (Amos 5:6a). Are you seeking out His wisdom as your greatest treasure?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Walking in rebellion against Jesus’ Wisdom may expose you to discipline and judgment</u>. For those who embrace the call of sin (Prov. 1:10-19) and reject wisdom’s call to “turn” or repent of sin (Prov. 1:23), wisdom will allow first discipline and then judgment. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention; <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>and you neglected all my advice and did not want my rebuke; <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>I will also laugh at your disaster; I will mock when your dread comes, <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>when your dread comes like a storm and your disaster comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me, <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>They did not accept my advice, they disdainfully rejected every rebuke from me. <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes. <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>For the faithlessness of the naive will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them</em>.” (Prov. 1:24-32). “A pause may be imagined, and seems to be implied, between this and the preceding verses (22 and 23), when the address passes into a new phase - from that of invitation and promise to that of judgment and stern denunciation (vers. 24-27).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 1:24).<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> “Wisdom’s call having been rejected, she now changes her tone from “mercy” to “judgment” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-1.htm">Psalm 101:1</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm">Romans 10:21</a> : “All day long I have stretched forth my hands,” &amp;c.)” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 1:24).<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus gives sinners many opportunities to repent</u>. Jesus warned that He will judge only those who reject His calls (Prov. 1:24-25, 30). He judged Israel only after His repeated calls for it to repent and turn back to Him. ‘“And now, because you have done all these things,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I spoke to you, speaking again and again, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer,”’ (Jer. 7:13). ‘“I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will bow down to the slaughter. Because I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not listen. Instead, you did evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.”’ (Is. 65:12). Yahweh is slow to anger and quick to forgive. “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;” (Ex. 34:6). “The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in mercy.” (Ps. 103:8). Jesus does not want any to perish (2 Pet. 3:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Mankind’s rebellion against God is futile</u>.  Although mankind may try to replace God’s morality with its own, its efforts are doomed to fail:  “<em><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>I will also laugh at your disaster; I will mock when your dread comes,</em>” (Prov. 1:26). “<em>He who sits in the heavens laughs, the Lord scoffs at them</em>.”  (Ps. 2:4). Everyone is a sinner (Ro. 3:23). Part of the wisdom of the fear of Jesus is to have a reverent respect for your need for salvation. “So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;” (Phil. 2:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Jesus’ wisdom face calamity and judgment</u>. Solomon prophetically spoke of people who reject the call of Yahweh’s wisdom as facing “<em>disaster</em>”; “<em>storms</em>,” “<em>whirlwinds</em>”, “<em>distress</em>,” “<em>anguish</em>”, and “<em>destruction.</em>” (Prov. 1:24-32). This will only happen because “<em>they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</em>” (Prov. 1:29)<em>.</em> Jesus repeated this warning in the New Testament. “And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:26-27).</p></li>

<h2 id="jesus-blessings.-jesus-blesses-those-who-follow-his-wisdom.-prov.-133."><strong>7) <u>Jesus’ Blessings. Jesus Blesses Those Who Follow His Wisdom</u>. Prov. 1:33.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who listen to Jesus’ wisdom and turn from evil will be blessed</u>. Jesus promises to bless those who heed His repeated calls of wisdom by repenting and returning to Him. “<strong><sup>33 </sup></strong><em>But whoever listens to me will live securely and will be at ease from the dread of evil</em>.” (Prov. 1:33). “To Wisdom, or Christ; to the cry and call above; to the voice of his Gospel, not only externally, but internally; so as spiritually and experimentally to understand it, to distinguish it from the voice of a stranger; so as to approve of it, and receive it in the love of it … they dwell in Christ the Rock of ages, against which the gates of hell cannot prevail, and on which their souls are built; and so remain safe amidst the floods, storms, and tempests, that beat upon them; the refuge to which they flee, the strong hold to which they turn, and whither they run and are safe; the ark in which they ride safely, amidst all the waves and billows of affliction and tribulation; their place of defense, where they are safe from Satan;” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 1:33).<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is faithful to bless those whose obey His calls</u>. In reference to wisdom’s call, Solomon later declared, “Now then, sons, listen to me, for <em>blessed are those who keep my ways</em>.” (Prov. 8:32). The psalmists also promised blessings when the reverent fear of Yahweh produces obedience. “<em>Blessed is everyone who fears the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who walks in His ways</em>.” (Ps. 128:1). “<em>Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD</em>.” (Ps. 119:1). God’s prophets also made similar promises. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; <em>then you will find a resting place for your souls</em>.” (Jer. 6:16a).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ “call” includes the blessing of salvation</u>. Those who respond to wisdom’s calling by accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior “<em>will live securely</em>” (Prov. 1:33). This means that they will enjoy the blessing of salvation by living with Jesus for all eternity. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”  (Jo. 3:16).  “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’”  (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). What Jesus offers is a “free” gift that only requires faith in Him:  “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  (Ro. 6:23).</p></li>

<p>The greatest act of wisdom is accepting Jesus’ call and His free gift of eternal life<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ “call” also includes the blessing of His fellowship</u>. Like wisdom calling in the streets, Jesus calls you to seek out His fellowship. “God is faithful, through whom <em>you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord</em>.” (1 Cor. 1:9). Jesus also offered to believers that they could enjoy spiritual intimacy with Him, symbolized by dining together with Him: ‘“Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, <em>I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me</em>.”’ (Rev. 3:20). He offered this so that you could find both fellowship and peace through Him (Jo. 16:33). Without His fellowship, your peace will be only temporary and easily broken (Eph. 2:13-15; Ro. 5:1). When you are in fellowship with Him, He offers the “peace that surpasses all understanding.” (Phil. 4:7). Sadly, many believers have been led to believe that being saved is the end all be all of being a Christian. But it is only the first step in a person’s walk with Jesus. If you want fellowship with Him, you must accept His calling on the door of your heart. Are you using your freedom to seek Jesus’ fellowship?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is worth more than any earthly treasure</u>. The blessing Jesus promises is spiritual. These include eternal salvation, fellowship with him, and right relationships with those around you. Some might prefer money and power. But after living as the Prodigal son, Solomon lamented that the blessing of Yahweh’s wisdom was greater than any of the wealth that he had accumulated: “How blessed is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver and her gain better than fine gold. She is more precious than jewels; and nothing you desire compares with her.” (Prov. 3:13-15). “Accept my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than jewels; and all desirable things cannot compare with her . . . My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, and my yield better than choicest silver.” (Prov. 8:10-11, 19). “How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver.” (Prov. 16:16). “Buy truth, and do not sell it, get wisdom, instruction, and understanding.” (Prov 23:23).</p></li>
