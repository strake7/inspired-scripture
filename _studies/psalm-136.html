<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, the psalmist gave thanks 26 times for God’s “<em>Ḥesed</em>” (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>). In the NASB, this word is translated as His “<em>faithfulness</em>.” In the KJB, and the NKJV, this word is translated as His “<em>mercy</em>”. In the NIVB, this same word is translated as His “<em>love</em>”. Other translations offer other interpretations. Thus, this Hebrew word is hard to translate. But it is rich in its meaning. According to many Hebrew scholars, this word “generally refers to an act of kindness from a more powerful figure in a relationship—in this case God—to a less powerful one. . . When used of God and Israel, it is often associated with God’s covenant or <span dir="rtl">בְּרִית</span> with Israel, as in Isaiah 54:8–10:  In slight anger, I hid My face for a moment from you; but with <strong>kindness (<em>chesed</em>)</strong> everlasting I will take you back in love—said YHWH your Redeemer.… <sup>‎</sup>”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The setting of Psalm 135 likely corresponds with a call and response worship format praising God’s “<em>Ḥesed</em>” found in Ezra 3. There, priests sang out in praise after God allowed them to start the Temple rebuilding. “This refrain was evidently sung as a response, either by a choir of priests and Levites answering the choir or the singer who chanted the first line; or by the whole congregation. We read that at the laying of the foundation stone of the Second Temple the priests and Levites ‘answered one another in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, saying, For he is good, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever toward Israel”’ (Alexander Kirpatrick on Ps. 136).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In Psalm 136, the Bible reveals several reasons to give thanks for God’s “<em>Ḥesed</em>”. These include His: (1) goodness, (2) sovereignty, (3) creation, (4) deliverance, (5) guidance, (6) provision, and (7) loving grace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the palmist thanked God that His goodness was everlasting. You can also give thanks because God is always good to you. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that God is more powerful than any worldly power. You can also give thanks that God is all-powerful with no power able to prevent Him from fulfilling His promises to you. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist also gave thanks for God’s wondrous creation. You can also give thanks for God’s great works of creation that you get to enjoy every day of your life. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist thanked God for delivering the Jews from Egyptian bondage and from Pharaoh’s army at the Red Sea. You can also give thanks for God’s many acts of deliverance in your life. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist thanked God for guiding the Jews in the wilderness on their way to the Promised Land. You can also give thanks that the Holy Spirit guides you through the wilderness of life to the eternal Promised Land in heaven. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that God gave the Jews a land inheritance after their many victories in battle. You can also give thanks that God is faithful to provide for you. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist gave thanks that God rescued the Jews from their lowly and undeserving state to faithfully provide for them. You can also give thanks that God rescued you out of loving grace from your lowly and undeserving state of sin to faithfully provide for you for all eternity. Thus, for many reasons, God’s goodness and His “<em>Ḥesed</em>” are worthy of your thanksgiving.</p>
<h2 id="his-goodness-give-thanks-because-god-is-always-good-to-you.-ps.-1361."><strong>1. <u>His Goodness: Give Thanks Because God is Always Good to You</u>. Ps. 136:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s goodness</u>. The psalmist began his praises for God by giving thanks for His goodness: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is good, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:1). He is “good” (<span dir="rtl">ט֑וֹב</span> (ṭō·wḇ)) translates as “Pleasant, agreeable, good.” In the Bible, it first appears to express the perfection of God’s creation before original sin corrupted it.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But this does not just describe what God does. It also describes who He is. “The fact that God <strong>is good</strong> is fundamental to all that He is and does. We know that <em>God is love</em> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1John+4.8&amp;t=NKJV"><u>1 John 4:8</u></a> and <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1John+4.16&amp;t=NKJV"><u>4:16</u></a>), and that love is an expression of His goodness. This is a wonderful reason to give Yahweh <strong>thanks</strong>… Because we are made in God’s image (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+1.26-27&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Genesis 1:26-27</u></a>), we know something of what is good. However, we are fallen (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Romans+5.19&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Romans 5:19</u></a>), and our knowledge of good is corrupted. Yet our entire concept of <em>good</em> is rooted in God and His goodness. Those who question God’s goodness do so according to some standard of what is good and what is evil. The very existence of that standard connects them to something beyond themselves – back to the Creator who made them in His image.” (David Guzik on Psalm 136) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Also give thanks for God’s covenant faithfulness, mercy, and love</u>. In Psalm 136, the psalmist repeated a similar declaration about God’s “<em>Ḥesed</em>” found in Ezra 3, Psalm 106, Psalm 107, Psalm 118, 1 Chronicles 16, 2 Chronicles 5:13, and 2 Chronicles 5:13. In Ezra 3, the Levities called out in a similar praise after they laid the foundation for the Second Temple: “And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, saying, ‘For He is good, for His favor is upon Israel forever.’ And all the people shouted with a great shout of joy when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.” (Ezra 3:11). Others psalms then repeat this praise. “Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>) mercy is everlasting.” (Ps. 106:1). “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good, for His (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>) mercy is everlasting.” (Ps. 107:1). “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is good; for His (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>) mercy is everlasting.’” (Ps. 118:1). “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His (<span dir="rtl">חֶסֶד</span>) faithfulness is everlasting.” (1 Chr. 16:34). The Israelites sang similar praises for God when His Shekinah glory filled Solomon’s Temple (2 Chr. 5:13; 7:3, 6). Depending upon the translation, the psalmist praised God’s faithfulness, mercy, or love. All descriptions describe parts of His goodness. In Psalm 136, the psalmist praised God’s everlasting “<em>Ḥesed</em>” 26 times for emphasis. “Forgetful as we are, things must be often repeated to us. By mercy we understand the Lord’s disposition to save those whom sin has rendered miserable and vile, and all the provision he has made for the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ. The counsels of this mercy have been from everlasting, and the effects of it will endure forever, to all who are interested in it. The Lord continues equally ready to show mercy to all who seek for it, and this is the source of all our hope and comfort.” (Matthew Henry on Psalm 136:1-9).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Give thanks for God’s faithfulness, mercy, and love in your life<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s covenant love is unbreakable, and it will last for all eternity</u>. In heaven, believers will forever celebrate God’s covenant mercy, love, and truth: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>For His mercy toward us is great, and the truth of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is everlasting. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!” (Ps. 117:2). But you don’t need to wait until you get to heaven to celebrate. You can thank Him now.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s mercy is first needed to allow mankind to experience His eternal love</u>. Each English translation helps to understand the reasons for the peoples to thank God. Sin cannot be in His holy presence (Habb. 1:13). Any sin in His presence will be burned up: “for our God is a consuming fire.” (Heb. 12:29). It is only His mercy, made possible through Jesus’ love for mankind at the cross (Jo. 3:16), that will allow people to be in His holy presence. “For Your mercy “<em>Hesed”</em> is great above the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the skies.” (Ps. 108:4). Without Jesus’ love for mankind, our sins would not be cleansed, and His mercy would not be available to believers. He is also faithful to forever forgive your sins when you repent (1 Jo. 1:9). Thus, you have many reasons to praise God for His covenant “<em>Hesed</em>” that will never end or removed from you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God is merciful</u>. Even though every person deserves to be judged for their sins, you can give thanks that God is filled with mercy each time you repent and return to Him: “<em>The Lord’s acts of mercy indeed do not end, for His compassions do not fail. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness</em>.” (Lam. 3:22-23). “Then you will say on that day, “I will give thanks to You, LORD; for although You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.” (Is. 12:1). “For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you.” (Is. 54:7). He is merciful in the face of our sins because he is filled with compassion and love: “For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.” (Dt. 4:31). God loves you and does not want you to suffer from your sins. Thus, He deserves your thanks.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s love will also pour out upon His peoples in heaven</u>. The same covenant is based upon God’s love for mankind. When God’s people experience this covenant love in heaven, they will sing with joy and amazement. “Your love “<em>Hesed”</em>, LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.” (Ps. 36:5) (NIV). “For great is your love “<em>Hesed</em>”, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.” (Ps. 57:10) (NIV). “I will sing of the LORD’s great love “<em>Hesed</em>” forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.” (Ps. 89:1) (NIV). “For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;” (Ps. 103:10). Love is part of God’s character, and true love comes from Him: “The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love.” (1 Jo. 4:8). It was His love for us that prompted Jesus to be sacrificed at the cross: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). Thus, you have many reasons to sing God’s praises and worship Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s love for you includes kindness and compassion</u>. God’s love includes “kindness” to you whenever you seek Him out: “Love is patient, <em>love is kind</em>, . . .” (1 Cor. 13:4). “so that in the ages to come He might show the boundless riches of <em>His grace in kindness</em> toward us in Christ Jesus.” (Eph. 2:7). “But when the <em>kindness</em> of God our Savior and <em>His</em> love for mankind appeared,” (Titus 3:4). “Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and restraint and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?” (Ro. 2:4). “Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God, <em>compassionate</em> and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in faithfulness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). “For the LORD will vindicate His people, and will have <em>compassion</em> on His servants, when He sees that their strength is gone, and there is none remaining, bond or free.” (Dt. 32:36). “We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the <em>Lord is full of compassion</em> and is merciful.” (Jam. 5:11). Thus, you don’t need to wait to get to heaven to experience God’s love and kindness.</p></li>

<h2 id="his-sovereignty-give-thanks-that-god-is-all-powerful-with-no-power-able-to-prevent-him-from-fulfilling-his-promises-to-you.-ps.-1362-3."><strong>2. <u>His Sovereignty: Give Thanks That God is All-Powerful With No Power Able</u> <u>to Prevent Him From Fulfilling His Promises to You</u>. Ps. 136:2-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s sovereignty</u>. The psalmist next gave thanks that God is more powerful than any worldly power. Thus, no force can keep Him from fulfilling His promises to you. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Give thanks to the God of gods, for His faithfulness is everlasting. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:2-3). “The ground of praise here is that it is a characteristic of the supreme God that he is a merciful Being; that there is blended in his character eternal mercy with infinite power. Mere power might fill us with dread; power mingled with mercy, and able to carry out the purposes of mercy, must lay the foundation for praise.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 136:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God is greater than any worldly power or idol</u>. The Psalms are filled with similar declarations regarding God’s unrivaled power. “For the LORD is a great God and a great King above all gods,” (Ps. 95:3). “For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.” (Ps. 96:4; 1 Chr. 16:25 (same). “For You are the LORD Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. (Ps. 97:9). “For I know that the LORD is great and that our Lord is above all gods.” (Ps. 135:5). These verses do not support the notion that other gods literally exist. The Bible is clear that there is only one God, who has a triune nature with Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and God the Father. “You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.” (Dt. 4:35). “This is what the LORD says, He who is the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of armies: ‘I am the first and I am the last, and there is no God besides Me.” (Is. 44:6). “I am the LORD, and there is no one else; there is no God except Me. I will arm you, though you have not known Me,” (Is. 45:5). The message is that God is sovereign, and no worldly power can prevent Him from keeping His promises. This also means that you do not need to fear the devil or worldly powers.</p></li>
<li><p><u>There is no miracle that is beyond God’s power</u>. Because God’s power is motivated by love, you can turn to Him when you are under attack, in bondage, depressed, sad, or in need. When it is part of His perfect will, there is nothing beyond God’s omnipotent power to accomplish. “For nothing will be impossible with God.” (Lk. 1:37). “Oh, Lord GOD! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,” (Jer. 32:17). “I know that You can do all things, and that no plan is impossible for You.” (Job 42:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Every knee will one day bow before Jesus</u>. As the Sovereign ruler of everything, all will one day bow before Jesus. “For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,” (Phil. 2:9). He sits on the throne and will soon reclaim the Earth as the King of Kings: “And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written: ‘King of Kings, and Lord of Lord.”’ (Rev. 19:16). “which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.” (Eph. 1:21). But you don’t need to wait until you get to heaven to thank your Lord and Savior.</p></li>

<h2 id="his-creation-give-thanks-for-gods-great-works-of-creation.-ps.-1364-9."><strong>3. <u>His Creation: Give Thanks for God’s Great Works of Creation</u>. Ps. 136:4-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s wonderful creation</u>. The psalmist also thanked God for His love as shown in His creation: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>To Him who alone does great wonders, for His faithfulness is everlasting; <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>to Him who made the heavens with skill, for His faithfulness is everlasting; <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>to Him who spread out the earth above the waters, for His faithfulness is everlasting; <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>to Him who made the great lights, for His faithfulness is everlasting: <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The sun to rule by day, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>the moon and stars to rule by night, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:4-9). “He set his wisdom to the task of fashioning a firmament, or an atmosphere suitable for a world upon which mortal men should dwell. What a mass of wisdom lies hidden in this one creating act! The discoveries of our keenest observers have never searched out all the evidence of design which are crowded together in this work of God’s hands. The lives of plants, animals, and men are dependent upon the fashioning of our heavens: had the skies been other than they are we had not been here to praise God. Divine foresight planned the air and the clouds, with a view to the human race. For his mercy endureth forever. The Psalmist’s details of mercy begin in the loftiest regions, and gradually descend from the heavens to ‘our low estate’ (Ps 134:23); and this is an ascent, for mercy becomes greater as its objects become less worthy. Mercy is far reaching, long enduring, all encompassing. Nothing is too high for its reach, as nothing is beneath its stoop.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 136:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God so loved mankind that He created a perfect universe and Earth for mankind</u>. God created the heavens and the Earth (Gen. 1:1).  Many psalmists urged the Jews to thank God as their Creator:  “May you be blessed of the LORD, maker of heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 115:15).  “Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 124:8).  “May the LORD bless you from Zion, He who made heaven and earth.”  (Ps. 134:3).  If you have the faith to celebrate that God created everything, you can have the faith to know that there is no problem that is too big for Him to deal with.</p></li>
<li><p><u>In heaven, believers will sing in awe about the wonders of God’s creation</u>. God’s ability to create a life-habitable universe and Earth is beyond our full understanding. In heaven, believers will sing in awe after they learn of the wonderous details of His creation. “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” (Rev. 4:11).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="his-deliverance-give-thanks-for-gods-acts-of-deliverance.-ps.-13610-15."><strong>4. <u>His Deliverance: Give Thanks for God’s Acts of Deliverance</u>. Ps. 136:10-15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s deliverance</u>. The psalmist next gave thanks for God’s deliverance of the Jews from Egyptian bondage and from Pharaoh’s army at the Red Sea. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>To Him who struck the Egyptians, that is, their firstborn, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>and brought Israel out from their midst, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, for His faithfulness is everlasting. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>To Him who divided the Red Sea in parts, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>and allowed Israel to pass through the midst of it, for His faithfulness is everlasting; <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>but He overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:10-15). “[F]or his mercy endureth for ever; and this is a proof of it, bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt, the house of bondage; when they cried unto him by reason of it, and he sent them a Savior to deliver them out of their distress, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-23.htm"><u>Exodus 2:23</u></a>; an emblem of the grace and mercy of God, in delivering his people from a worse than Egyptian bondage; from the bondage of sin, Satan, the law, and through fear of death, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Ps. 136:11).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God raised up and repeatedly saved Israel for His glory</u>. After the Jews returned from Babylonian captivity, Nehemiah reminded the Jews that God performed miracles in Egypt so that all the nations might turn to Him. “Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants and all the people of his land; for You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them, and <em>You made a name for Yourself</em> as it is this day.” (Neh. 9:10). For any family that did not turn to God in faith, He struck down every firstborn person and animal (Ex. 12:29: Nu. 33:4; Ps. 78:51; 105:36; 136:10; Heb. 11:28; Ps. 136:10; 135:8). To demonstrate His power to deliver, He also parted the Red Sea and then crushed Pharaoh’s army after bringing the Jews to safety (Ps. 136:13-15; 78:13; 106:9; Ex. 14:21-22; 15:8; Dt. 11:4; Is. 51:10; Neh. 9:11; Heb. 11:29). In the prior Psalm 135, the psalmist also again reminded the Jews that God delivered them and showed His signs and wonders in Egypt for His glory, not theirs (Ps. 135:9). God explained to Moses that He showed His signs and wonders so that “His name” would offer hope to people across the Earth (Ex. 9:16). He has remained faithful to Israel so that His faithfulness might be known and become a beacon of light to all the gentile nations of the Earth (1 Sam. 12:22). “Nevertheless He saved them for the sake of His name, so that He might make His power known.” (Ps. 106:8). “For My own sake, for My own sake, I will act; for how can My name be profaned? And I will not give My glory to another.” (Is. 48:11). “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘It is not for your sake, house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.”’’ (Ezek. 36:22). When God delivers you, you can glorify Him by giving Him the credit. This will help draw others to Him.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise God for His deliverance from your enemies and from your sins</u>.  Like the Jews did in recounting their journey in the wilderness, you are encouraged to recount God’s provision for you and the many times that He has delivered you from your enemies.  “I shall remember the deeds of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.”  (Ps. 77:11).  You are also encouraged to teach your children and grandchildren what God has done for you:  “One generation shall praise Your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts.”  (Ps. 145:4).  Have you shared God’s blessings in your life with others?  Have you praised Him for the many times that He has delivered you?</p></li>

<h2 id="his-guidance-give-thanks-that-the-holy-spirit-guides-you.-ps.-13616."><strong>5. <u>His Guidance: Give Thanks That the Holy Spirit Guides You</u>. Ps. 136:16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s guidance</u>. The psalmist also thanked God for safely guiding the Jews through the barren wilderness to the Promised Land. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>To Him who led His people through the wilderness, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>;” (Ps. 136:16). “What a multitude of mercies are comprehended in the conduct of such an enormous host through a region wherein there was no provision even for single travelers; yet the Lord by his infinite power and wisdom conducted a whole nation for forty years through a desert land, and their feet did not swell, neither did their garments wax old in all the journey… Their conduct in the wilderness tested his mercy most severely, but it bore the strain; many a time he forgave them; and though he smote them for their transgressions, yet he waited to be gracious and speedily turned to them in compassion. Their faithfulness soon failed, but his did not: the fiery, cloudy pillar which never ceased to lead the van was the visible proof of his immutable love.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 136:16).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God guided the Jews with His pillar of light</u>.  After the Jews returned from Babylonian captivity, Nehemiah also looked back to the exodus to remind them that God was faithful to guide them in the wilderness: “And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day, and with a pillar of fire by night to light for them the way in which they were to go.”  (Neh. 9:12; Ex. 13:21-22; 14:19; Dt. 1:33). To encourage the Jews, the psalmists repeated this message. “Then He led them with the cloud by day and all the night with a light of fire.” (Ps. 78:14; 105:39l 136:16).  The cloud and the pillar of light represented the Holy Spirit.  When you read God’s Word and pray, the Holy Spirit can speak to you:  “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.”  (Jo. 14:16).  “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.”  (Jo. 16:13).  Are you praying for the Holy Spirit to guide you? </p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God also guided the Jews with His Word</u>.  Upon their return from Babylonian captivity, Nehemiah also celebrated that God gave them His Word and His “commandments, statutes, and law, through Your servant Moses.”  (Neh. 9:13-14; Ex. 19:20; 20:1-21). When Moses delivered God’s law, He declared: “So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”’  (Dt. 4:6). The psalmist declared: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19).  “The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.”  (Ps. 19:7).  “The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.”  (Ps. 119:130).  Solomon also declared: “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and reproofs for discipline are the way of life”  (Prov. 6:23).  Are you reading the Word so that God can guide you?</p></li>

<h2 id="his-provision-give-thanks-that-god-also-provides-for-you.-ps.-13617-22."><strong>6. <u>His Provision: Give Thanks That God Also Provides for You</u>. Ps. 136:17-22.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s faithful provision</u>. The psalmist next gave thanks that God used His acts of supernatural deliverance to provide a land inheritance for His people. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>to Him who struck great kings, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>and brought death to mighty kings, for His faithfulness is everlasting: <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Sihon, king of the Amorites, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>and Og, king of Bashan, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>and gave their land as an inheritance, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>an inheritance to His servant Israel, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:17-22). To show God’s mercy, faithfulness, and love, the psalmist omits any reference to the Jews’ rebellions. “The psalmist passes right over the wilderness generation’s refusal to enter the land and their forty years of wandering until that generation perished in the wilderness so that their children could take the land.” (James Hamilton, Ps. 136:17-22).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<p>God provided for the Jews with their victories<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s provision also included conquered lands</u>.  To provide for the Jews, God gave them conquered lands.  To east of the Jordan River, these included the lands that once belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan (Ps. 136:19-20; 135:10-12; Nu. 21:33-35; Dt. 3:1-3; Josh. 12:1-6; Jdgs. 11:19-22; Neh. 9:22-24).  God fulfilled His promise to Abraham to make the Jews a great nation (Gen. 15:5; 22:17; Neh. 9:23).  He further fulfilled His promise to Abraham to give the Jews the Promised Land (Josh. 21:43; Neh. 9:24).  God also delivered the Jews and gave their enemy’s lands to them as an inheritance, “driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is today.” (Dt. 4:38; Josh. 23:9; Ps. 44:2-3; 78:55; 105:44). While the Jews gave thanks for their Promised Land on Earth, you can give thanks for your eternal Promised Land in heaven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will also provide for you as well</u>.  Jesus cares for you in the wilderness  (Hos. 13:5).  He is your manna and your food  (Jo. 6:35; Matt. 6:31).  He is the “rock” who gives you the water of contentment in your wilderness  (Jo. 4:14; 6:36; 7:37-38; 1 Cor. 10:3-4).  He clothes you (Matt. 6:30).  He is also “the rock of our salvation”  (Ps. 95:1; Dt. 32:3-4; Isa. 26:4).  Likewise, He is a rock and a shield for all who take refuge in Him  (Ps. 18:30; 2 Sam. 22:3, 31).  Thus, He tells you not to worry about your provision  (Matt. 6:34).  If you complain about your provision, you are not trusting Him.  Are there areas of worry or doubt in your life?  If so, repent of these things.  If you are in need, “seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”  (Matt. 6:33).  You can then give thanks for Jesus’ provision.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="his-loving-grace-give-thanks-for-gods-loving-grace.-ps.-13623-26."><strong>7. <u>His Loving Grace: Give Thanks for God’s Loving Grace</u>. Ps. 136:23-26.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s eternal loving grace</u>. The psalmist concluded by giving thanks that God rescued the Jews from their lowly and undeserving status out of loving grace to faithfully provide for them. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Who remembered us in our lowliness, for His faithfulness is everlasting, <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>and has rescued us from our enemies, for His faithfulness is everlasting; <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>who gives food to all flesh, for His faithfulness is everlasting. <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Give thanks to the God of heaven, for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>.” (Ps. 136:23-26). This psalm also connects to Jesus’ loving grace. John Calvin taught that the repeated usage of the phrase “<em>for His faithfulness is everlasting</em>” teaches that proper praise should include acknowledging that everything we received is a gift of God’s grace. (Steven Cole on Ps. 136).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s mercy and grace</u>. To encourage the Jews who felt that God would not fully restore them after Babylonian captivity, the psalmist reminded them that God “<em>remembered us in our lowliness</em>.” (Ps. 136:22). God heard the Jews’ affliction in Egypt (Ex. 3:7; Neh. 9:9). He then saved them and provided for them (Ps. 136:24-25). When the Jews later settled in the Promised Land and turned against God, He again heard their cries and showed them mercy (2 Kgs. 13:23; Jdgs. 2:18; Ps. 106:44; Neh. 9:27-28). God then again saved them provided for them (Ps. 136:24-25). When you sin and repent, He is faithful to forgive your sins (1 Jo. 1:9). Thus, you can also give thanks for God’s mercy and grace in restoring you after you sin. He is worthy of your praise.</p></li>

<p>Give thanks that God’s mercy, grace, and faithfulness will last forever<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for everything God does for you</u>. Every good and perfect thing in your life comes from God (Jam. 1:17). Even your trials create a reason to praise God because they draw you closer to Him (Jam. 1:2-4). “The point of Psalm 136 is obvious: acknowledge the LORD in the assembly for his faithful love displayed in his mighty works, especially in creation and redemption. These two themes for praise stand out frequently in Scripture, even in the great heavenly anthems recorded in Revelation 4 and 5. But a listing of God’s works can never be complete and so a psalm like this should prompt believers to add more or form their own songs of praise …” (Allen Ross on Ps. 136).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God’s faithfulness is not dependent on your faithfulness</u>.  God could have revoked His blessings upon the Jews for their rebellions.  But even when the Jews rebelled against Him God remained faithful.  He remained faithful to His promise to never forsake the Jews:  “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you.  He will not fail you or forsake you.”  (Dt. 31:6; 4:31; Heb. 13:5).  ‘“I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.”’  (Is. 43:25).  You can also give thanks that His faithfulness is not conditioned upon our faithfulness:  “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.”  (2 Tim. 2:13).  Have you given thanks that God will not use your sins to revoke His promises to you?</p></li>
