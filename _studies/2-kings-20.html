Kings 20: Lessons from Hezekiah’s Example Regarding Additional Blessings
that God Offers to All Believers</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: In 2 Kings 19, God revealed seven blessings that
He offers to faithful believers through His defeat of the Assyrian army.
These include: (1) guidance, (2) encouragement, (3) protection, (4)
deliverance, (5) answered prayers, (6) restoration, and (7) forgiveness.
In 2 Kings 20, God used Hezekiah’s successes and his failures to reveal
seven additional things that He offers to believers. These include: (1)
healing, (2) a prolonged life, (3) His faithfulness, (4) His forgiveness
(offered a second time), (5) conviction of sin, (6) discipline and (7)
mercy and grace.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, when faced with a mortal illness before the Assyrian
invasion, Hezekiah cried out to God for deliverance. God heard his
prayers and healed Hezekiah. From Hezekiah’s faithful example, God
reveals that He may heal your illness when you faithfully seek Him.
<u>Second</u>, as a reward for his faith-led obedience, God extended
Hezekiah’s life by 15 extra years. This confirmed promises that God made
to His people through Moses. Through Hezekiah’s example, God confirmed
His promise to prolong the life of a believer whose faith produces the
fruit of obedience. <u>Third</u>, Hezekiah then sadly sinned by asking
for a sign and by failing to thank God. God, however, was still faithful
to keep His promise to Hezekiah. From this example, God reveals that He
is faithful to keep His promises, even when our faith fails us.
<u>Fourth</u>, Hezekiah then committed several sins when he agreed to an
alliance with Babylon and showed all of Judah’s hidden gold in an act of
pride. Although God could have revoked His promises to protect Judah
from Assyria, He instead forgave the Jews and defeated the Assyrians.
Because forgiveness is such an important part of God’s character, this
theme is repeated across both chapters. Just as He did for Hezekiah, God
offers to forgive His people, even when they fail to trust Him.
<u>Fifth</u>, God used Isaiah to try to gently convict Hezekiah of his
sins. Today, God’s Word and the Holy Spirit work together to convict
sinners to cause them to repent. <u>Sixth</u>, because of Hezekiah’s
sins and the sins that his son Manasseh would commit, God would
discipline the Jews by sending them into Babylonian captivity. Yet, He
waited approximately a century longer to give the Jews a chance to
repent. From these events, God reveals that He disciplines His people
out of love to correct them. <u>Finally</u>, despite his sins, God
celebrated Hezekiah for his faith and his obedience. From this example,
God reveals that His mercy and grace is greater than our sins. Yet, this
mercy and grace is available only through Jesus.</p>

<u>Healing: God Offers to Heal Your Illness When You Faithfully Seek
Him</u>. 2 Kgs. 20:1-3.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah cries out to God when faced with a mortal
illness</u>. In one of his many tests of faith, Isaiah revealed to
Hezekiah that he would soon die from an illness. Hezekiah showed both
his faith and his knowledge of God’s Word by praying in faith for one of
the blessings that God promised for those who act with faith-led
obedience. “<sup>1</sup> <em>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill.
And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him,
‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘Set your house in
order, for you shall die and not live.’’ <sup>2 </sup>Then he turned his
face to the wall and prayed to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
saying, <sup>3 </sup>‘Remember now, O <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I beseech You, how I have walked before
You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your
sight.’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly</em>.” (2 Kgs. 20:1-3; 2 Chr. 32:24;
Is. 38:1). These events are told out of chronological order for thematic
reasons around the middle of Hezekiah’s reign. We know this because God
promised to defend Jerusalem later on in this chapter: “<em>I will
defend this</em> city. . .” (2 Kgs. 20:6). Based upon the length of his
reign, Isaiah confronted Hezekiah with God’s testing approximately 12
years before King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded and approximately 15
years before Hezekiah died (Isa. 38:1-22). Based on the ages given in
two separate verses, he was only 39 years old when Isaiah told him to
prepare for his death (2 Kgs. 18:2; 20:6). This was a test of faith that
God knew in advance that Hezekiah would pass. Hezekiah cried out to God
and placed his trust in God to be healed. Hezekiah did not want to die.
Because Manasseh was only 12 when he became king (2 Kgs. 21:1), this
means that Judah would have died without an heir if God had not extended
Hezekiah’s life by 15 years. God’s answer to Hezekiah’s prayers
reaffirmed His conditional promise to Solomon that a faithful king would
never lack an heir to the throne (1 Kgs. 9:5-9).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God can restore the health of a faithful believer</u>.
Hezekiah called out in faith by reciting God’s promises. He had lived in
a faith-led obedience that was unlike any king since David: “Thus
Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what was good, right and
true before the LORD his God.” (2 Chr. 31:20). Through Moses, God
promised to pour out His blessings on those who live in faith-led
obedience (Dt. 28:1-2). This can include His promise to withhold
diseases and poor health: “And He said, ‘If you will give earnest heed
to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight,
and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put
none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for
<em>I, the LORD, am your healer.</em>’” (Ex. 15:26; Dt. 7:15). ‘“See now
that I, I am He, and there is no god besides Me; it is I who put to
death and give life. I have wounded <em>and it is I who heal</em>, and
there is no one who can deliver from My hand.”’ (Dt. 32:39). “ . . .
<em>the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He
has inflicted</em>.” (Is. 30:26). “For He inflicts pain, and gives
relief; He wounds, and <em>His hands also heal</em>.” (Job 5:8). “<em>He
heals</em> the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” (Ps. 147:3).
“He sent His word <em>and healed them</em>, and delivered them from
their destructions.” (Ps. 107:20). You cannot earn God’s blessings. Yet,
God is faithful to bless those who live with faith-led
obedience.</p></li>
<li><p><u>All things are possible with God when you have faith</u>.
Hezekiah also had faith because he knew that God can do all things: “Is
anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14(a)). “Behold, I am the
LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” (Jer.
32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours
can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). “‘With people this is impossible, but with
God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26(b); Mk. 10:27(b); Lk. 1:37).
“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is
against us?” (Ro. 8:31). God also wants you to turn to Him in faith when
your health issues seem impossible. His miracles happen every
day.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You cannot earn God’s healing through your works</u>. By
Jesus’ stripes you can also be healed from any infirmity: “But He was
pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our
iniquities; the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, <em>and by
His scourging we are healed</em>.” (Is. 53:5; 1 Pet. 2:24). He is so
powerful that He healed a leper merely with His touch or His command:
“Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, ‘I am willing; be
cleansed.’ And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” (Matt. 8:3).
Although your faith-led obedience can bring His blessing of healing, you
cannot earn His healings through your works. This would undermine Jesus’
sacrifice. God illustrated this principle in the Old Testament through
His healing of the Syrian leper Naaman. Naaman wanted to earn his
healing through a dramatic test of his strength in the raging
mountainous rivers in Syria. He did not want to dunk himself seven times
in the calm Jordan River (2 Kgs. 5:9-12). God never wants you to serve
Him with the wrong motives. But He also wants you to know that His offer
to bless and restore your health is real. Serve Him in obedience and let
Him bless you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God when you need deliverance from an illness or
disease</u>. Some think that a true person of faith should stoically
accept bad news. But Hezekiah showed that he was a man of faith because
he cried out to God for healing. David also cried out for God when he
needed healing: “O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and <em>You
healed me</em>.” (Ps. 30:2). “Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining
away; heal me, O LORD, for <em>my bones are dismayed</em>.” (Ps. 6:2).
“As for me, I said, ‘O LORD, be gracious to me; <em>heal my soul</em>,
for I have sinned against You.”’ (Ps. 41:4). Moses also cried out for
God to heal his sister Miriam from her leprosy: “Moses cried out to the
LORD, saying, ‘O God, heal her, I pray!”’ (Nu. 12:13). Have you cried
out to God if you need healing?</p></li>

<u>Prolonged Life: God Offers To Prolong the Life of an Obedient
Believer</u>. 2 Kgs. 20:4-7.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Because of his faith-led obedience, God extends Hezekiah’s
life 15 years</u>. In response to Hezekiah’s cry for healing and his
faithful obedience, God extended his life by 15 years:
“<sup>4 </sup><em>Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the
word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came to him, saying,
<sup>5 </sup>‘Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus
says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of your father
David, ‘I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will
heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>6 </sup>I will add fifteen years to
your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the
king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My
servant David’s sake.’’ <sup>7 </sup>Then Isaiah said, ‘Take a cake of
figs.’ And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered</em>.” (2
Kgs. 20:4-7). God heard Hezekiah’s righteous prayers and gave Isaiah His
response before Isaiah had even left Hezekiah’s palace. God heard his
prayers and saw his tears (Isa. 38:5). God not only promised to extend
his life, He also promised to defend Jerusalem from the mighty Assyrian
army (2 Kgs. 20:6; Is. 37:36-37).</p></li>

role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God promises to extend your life when you follow His Fifth
Commandment</u>. As part of the Fifth Commandment, God promised to
prolong the lives of believers when they follow it. When He gave this
promise to Moses, the blessing was limited to a longer life for the Jews
who lived inside the Promised Land: “Honor your father and your mother,
<em>that your days may be prolonged</em> in the land which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God gives you.” (Ex. 20:12; Dt.
5:16). But, when God restated this commandment through Paul, He expanded
it to include a longer life and a blessed life for believers in Christ
anywhere on the Earth: “Honor Your Father and Mother <em>so that it may
be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth</em>.” (Eph.
6:2-3). When you follow the Fifth Commandment, God may bless you and
your children through good relationships and peace: “All your sons will
be taught of the LORD; and the well-being of your sons will be great.”
(Is. 54:13). Through your walk with Jesus, are you giving your children
a reason to honor you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Spirit-led obedience may extend your life longer than it would
have been</u>. God blessed Hezekiah because of his faith and obedience
were unlike any king before him: “<sup>5 </sup>He trusted in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel; so that after him
there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those
who were before him. <sup>6 </sup>For he clung to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; he did not depart from following Him, but
kept His commandments, which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had
commanded Moses.” (2 Kgs. 18:5). God also promises to prolong your life
on Earth if you walk in faith-led obedience to God’s Commandments and
His Word: “Walk in all the way that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, so that you
may live and prosper and <em>prolong your days</em> in the land that you
will possess (Dt. 5:32-33; 4:40; Lev. 18:5). “Now this is the
commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded me to teach you,
that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess
it, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, to keep all His statutes and His
commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and
<em>that your days may be prolonged</em>.” (Dt. 6:1-2). “so that you may
prolong your days on the land which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> swore to your fathers to give to them and
to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.” (Dt. 11:9).
“My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep My
commandments; <em>for length of days and years of life and peace they
will add to you.”</em> (Prov. 3:1-2). “For by me your days will be
multiplied, and <em>years of life will be added to you</em>.” (Prov.
9:11). “<em>The fear of the LORD prolongs life</em>, but the years of
the wicked will be shortened.” (Prov. 10:27). When your faith leads to
obedience, God may extend your time a day, a week, a year, a decade, or
longer. You will never know how much longer He extended your life until
you get to heaven. For now, He wants you to have the faith to believe
that His promises are true. If you doubt His promise of a prolonged
life, you should not expect Him to extend your life (Jam. 1:6-7).
Indeed, “without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes
to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6). If you are battling a long-term illness or if
you simply want to live longer, are you willing to obey in faith for God
to prolong your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because He loves you, God also hears your cries to Him</u>.
Like Hezekiah, God also responded to the cries of His people when they
were oppressed. For example, when God picked Moses in response to the
cries of His people in Egypt: “The LORD said, ‘I have surely seen the
affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their
cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.’”
(Ex. 3:7). He had also responded previously to their cries of oppression
in the Promised Land (Jdgs. 2:18). “Many times He would deliver them;
they, however, were rebellious in their counsel, and so sank down in
their iniquity. Nevertheless He looked upon their distress when He heard
their cry; and He remembered His covenant for their sake, and relented
according to the greatness of His lovingkindness.” (Ps. 106:43-45). This
same love caused Jesus to come to Earth and allow Himself to be killed
so that undeserving sinners might be delivered (Jo. 3:16). If God has
rescued you from the pain, praise Him (Ro. 12:1-2).</p></li>

<u>Faithfulness: God is Faithful, Even When We Aren’t Faithful</u>. 2
Kgs. 20:8-11.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah asks God for a sign and then fails to thank Him</u>.
Although Hezekiah was a man of incredible faith, he erred in asking
Isaiah for a sign of God’s faithfulness and by failing to thank Him:
“<sup>8 </sup><em>Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah, ‘What will be the sign
that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will heal me, and that I
shall go up to the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the
third day?’ <sup>9 </sup>Isaiah said, ‘This shall be the sign to you
from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will do the thing that He has spoken:
shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?’
<sup>10 </sup>So Hezekiah answered, ‘It is easy for the shadow to
decline ten steps; no, but let the shadow turn backward ten steps.’
<sup>11 </sup>Isaiah the prophet cried to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and He brought the shadow on the stairway
back ten steps by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz</em>.”
(2 Kgs. 20:8-11). Hezekiah wanted to wait until the third day after he
was healed to return to the courtyard of God’s Temple. God, however, did
not need to provide Hezekiah with an additional sign. Nevertheless, He
promised that He would alter time by allowing Hezekiah to see Him
supernaturally alter the sun’s shadow by ten degrees.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s mercy and grace in response to Hezekiah’s lack of
faith</u>. If Hezekiah’s faith were pure, he would not have asked for a
sign to confirm God’s Word. But the Bible shows the heroes of the faith
with their faults so that you will never feel defeated in trying to live
up to their example. Hezekiah also was not alone in asking God to
confirm His promises with a sign. For example, Moses repeatedly
questioned God’s calling (Ex. 3:11; 4:10, 13). He also demanded a sign
so that others would believe that God had sent him (Ex. 4:1). Gideon
also failed to trust God by demanding that He produce a sign to confirm
His Word (Jdgs. 6:17-24). David also felt the need for a sign of God’s
confirmation: “<em>Show me a sign</em> for good, that those who hate me
may see it and be ashamed, because You, O LORD, have helped me and
comforted me.” (Ps. 86:17). Likewise, Thomas demanded to see the holes
in Jesus’ hands to confirm that He had risen from the dead (Jo. 20:25;
Mk. 16:11-14). Yet, this does not mean that you should repeat their
mistakes by asking for a sign: “But He answered and said to them, ‘An
evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will
be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;”’ (Matt. 12:39). The
many fulfilled promises in the Bible are all you need to trust God’s
Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah’s failure to thank God for His healing and extended
life</u>. In addition to his error in asking for a sign, Hezekiah also
failed to thank God for His blessings: “<sup>24 </sup>In those days
Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to him and gave him a sign.
<sup>25 </sup><em>But Hezekiah gave no return for the benefit he
received, because his heart was proud</em>; therefore wrath came on him
and on Judah and Jerusalem. <sup>26 </sup>However, Hezekiah humbled the
pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that
the wrath of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> did not come on
them in the days of Hezekiah.” (2 Chr. 32:24-26). Hezekiah’s actions
show the dangers from believing that you have earned a blessing.
Hezekiah correctly recited God’s promises as a sign of his faith. Yet,
he made the mistake of believing that he had earned God’s blessings.
This dilemma has caused some churches to avoid discussing God’s
blessings. Yet, this is also a mistake. The correct approach is to teach
people not to claim God’s blessings with a sense of entitlement. It is
only through Jesus’ mercy and grace that He may decide to bless
you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that God’s faithfulness is not dependent on your
faithfulness</u>. God could have revoked His blessings based upon
Hezekiah’s lack of faith. Yet, God showed that His faithfulness is not
conditioned upon our faithfulness: “If we are faithless, He remains
faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). “God is not a man,
that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; has He
said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it
good?” (Nu. 23:19). Have you given thanks that God will not use your
sins to void any of His many promises to bless you?</p></li>

<u>Forgiveness: God Offers to Forgive His People When They Sin</u>. 2
Kgs. 20:12-13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah agrees to the Babylonian’s help against Assyria</u>.
Instead of fully trusting in God, Hezekiah agreed to meet with the King
of Babylon to build a worldly alliance against Assyria. To demonstrate
that he would be a worthy ally, Hezekiah also showed the Babylonians all
the gold in his kingdom: “<sup>12 </sup><em>At that time
Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a
present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
<sup>13 </sup>Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his
treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious
oil and the house of his armor and all that was found in his treasuries.
There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did
not show them</em>.” (2 Kgs. 20:12-13). Berodach-baladan (a.k.a.,
Merodach-baladan (Is. 39:1-2)) was the ruler of Babylon. Before the Jews
defeated Assyria, he came to Judah to build an alliance against King
Sargon of Assyria. Hezekiah showed with pride all of God’s treasures
without giving any credit to God. Not long after boasting of these
treasures, Hezekiah gave these treasures to the Assyrians in an effort
to appease them: “<sup>15 </sup>Hezekiah gave him all the silver which
was found in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and
in the treasuries of the king’s house. <sup>16 </sup>At that time
Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and from the doorposts which Hezekiah
king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.” (2 Kgs.
18:15).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah’s seven sins</u>. Despite his many virtues, Hezekiah
committed several sins. One commentator explains five of these sins as
follows: “· [First,] <em>Pride</em>, in that he was proud of the honors
the Babylonians brought. ·[Second,] <em>Ingratitude</em>, in that he
took honor to himself that really belonged to God. ·
[Third,] <em>Abusing the gifts given to him</em>, where he took the
gifts and favors to his own honor and gratification of his lusts (2
Chronicles 32:25-26). · [Fourth,] <em>Carnal confidence</em>, in that he
trusted in the coalition he had made with the king of Babylon.
· [Fifth,] <em>Missing opportunity</em>, in that he had a great
opportunity to testify to the Babylonian envoys about the greatness of
God and the LORD’s blessing on Judah. Instead, he glorified himself.”
(David Guzik on 2 Kgs. 20).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"
class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Sixth, he
committed the sin of <em>disobedience</em>. He was not to form treaties
with pagan nations: “ . . . You shall make no covenant with them and
show no favor to them.” (Dt. 7:2). Finally, he committed the sin of
<em>prayerlessness</em>. He failed to pray or seek God’s guidance in
dealing with the King of Babylon. Hezekiah had access to God’s prophet
Isaiah. Yet, he failed to seek out God’s guidance in advance through His
prophet.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Walk humbly and use God’s gifts for Him so that He can exalt
you</u>. Like Hezekiah, God wants to exalt you. But you must also walk
in humble service to God and not the needs of your own flesh: “Whoever
exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be
exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11; 18:14). “A man’s pride will bring him
low, but a humble spirit will obtain honor.” (Prov. 29:23). “‘God is
opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”’ (Jam. 4:6(b)). Do
you walk with humility by serving God and His people? If so, He will
exalt you either on Earth or in heaven.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t credit your God-given gifts to your own actions</u>.
Like Hezekiah, many successful people honor themselves with their gifts
because they feel responsible for their accomplishments or knowledge.
Yet, believers should never boast in their God-given wisdom or other
gifts. “Thus says the LORD, ‘<em>Let not a wise man boast of his
wisdom</em>, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a
rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that
he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises
lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in
these things,’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 9:23-24). “But may it never be
that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”
(Gal. 6:14). When others praise you, do you praise Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is worth more than any earthly honor or
treasure</u>. Solomon also erred in taking credit for the financial
blessings that God bestowed upon him. Even though God’s wisdom may bring
honor, respect, or money, Solomon later learned from his mistakes that
God’s wisdom is worth more than any money: “How much better it is to get
wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above
silver.” (Prov. 16:16). “My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold,
and my yield better than choicest silver.” (Prov. 8:19). Do you seek out
riches, power, and respect? Or, do you seek God’s wisdom?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God offers to forgive His people when they sin</u>. Hezekiah
did not need to turn to Babylon for help. Through Isaiah, God later
encouraged Hezekiah not to fear his enemy: “<em>‘Do not be afraid</em>.
. .” (2 Kgs. 19:6). Moses also encouraged the Jews not to fear their
enemies: (Dt. 20:1-4; 31:8). “The LORD will protect you from all evil;
He will keep your soul.” (Ps. 121:7). “No harm befalls the righteous,
but the wicked are filled with trouble.” (Prov. 12:21). God then
fulfilled His promises by killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers before they
could even begin a siege (2 Kgs. 19:35-37; 2 Chr. 32:21-22; Is.
37:36-38). This shows that God can forgive His people when they sin
against Him.</p></li>

<u>Conviction: God’s Word Convicts Sinners to Cause Them to Repent</u>.
2 Kgs. 20:14-15.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Isaiah confronts Hezekiah, yet Hezekiah fails to repent</u>.
After engaging in these sins, Hezekiah also failed to repent of his
actions when Isaiah confronted him: “<sup>14 </sup><em>Then Isaiah the
prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, ‘What did these men say,
and from where have they come to you?’ And Hezekiah said, ‘They have
come from a far country, from Babylon.’ <sup>15 </sup>He said, ‘What
have they seen in your house?’ So Hezekiah answered, ‘They have seen all
that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have
not shown them</em>.’” (2 Kgs. 20:14-15). God did not want Hezekiah to
depend upon the pagan powers of the world as his refuge. God therefore
revealed to Isaiah what Hezekiah had done. Thus, Isaiah did not ask a
question where he did not know the answer. Instead, he asked a question
to cause Hezekiah to think about his actions and then repent.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God frequently sent prophets to confront sinful leaders when
the Church was silent</u>. There were many times in Israel’s history
when God was forced to send prophets when the Church stayed silent in
the face of a leader’s sin. For example, God’s prophet Samuel confronted
Saul for his rebellion and disobedience (1 Sam. 15:17-29; 13:14). God’s
prophet Nathan confronted David when he committed adultery and murder (2
Sam. 12:1-9). God’s prophet Ahijah confronted King Jeroboam for his
idolatry (1 Kgs. 14:7-16). God’s prophet Jehu also confronted King
Baasha for his idolatry (1 Kgs. 16:1-5). Here, God sent Isaiah to
confront Hezekiah (2 Kgs. 20:14-15). God later sent the prophet Ezekiel
to warn all leaders who misuse their power to prey upon God’s people
(Ezek. 34:1-10). Today, God again needs people of faith to speak His
Word to sinful leaders.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Word is meant to convict and restore sinners</u>. Like
Isaiah, God also gently confronted Adam and Eve with a question to cause
them to repent of their sins (Gen. 3:8-10). Unfortunately, because they
did not repent, all of mankind has suffered. God also convicted Joseph’s
brothers for their sins in selling Joseph into slavery (Gen. 42:21-22).
Jesus also convicted Peter for his sins in denying Jesus before His
accusers (Matt. 26:75). Today, the Holy Spirit uses God’s Word to
convict you of your sins: “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the
Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to
your remembrance all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26). But, if you don’t
know God’s Word, you are not giving the Spirit much to convict you of
your sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Church was also meant to convict sinners</u>. The Church
is called upon to be God’s salt and light (Matt. 5:3-16). Salt is an
irritant in the wound of sin. When the Church stays out of politics,
Satan has a free hand to corrupt leaders. When, as now, the Church is
silent in the face of a sinful society, God calls upon His people to
deliver a message of repentance like Isaiah. In preparation for Jesus,
John the Baptist called all sinners to repent. ‘“Repent, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand.”’ (Matt. 3:2). Jesus also began His ministry with
a call to repentance: “From that time Jesus began to preach and say,
‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”’ (Matt. 4:17; Lk.
18:13.) If you say that you are without sin, the truth is not in you (1
Jo. 1:8). Yet, if you confess your sins, Jesus will forgive you: “If we
confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9). If you have
repented of your sins, are you calling upon sinners around you to
repentant?</p></li>

<u>Discipline: Out of Love, God Disciplines His People to Correct
Them</u>. 2 Kgs. 20:16-19.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Isaiah prophesied that the Babylonians would steal all that
Hezekiah showed them</u>. Because of Hezekiah’s sins and because he
failed to repent, Isaiah warned that the Babylonians would one day
return and seize the remaining gold inside of Judah:
“<sup>16 </sup><em>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‘Hear the word of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>17 </sup>‘Behold, the days are
coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have
laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing shall
be left,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
<sup>18 </sup>‘Some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you will
beget, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace
of the king of Babylon.’’’ <sup>19 </sup>Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah,
‘The word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> which you have
spoken is good.’ For he thought, ‘Is it not so, if there will be peace
and truth in my days</em>?’” (2 Kgs. 20:16-19). Isaiah prophesied that
the Babylonians would both take the Jews into captivity, and they would
seize the remaining hidden treasures of Judah. Hezekiah again failed to
repent. Instead, he appeared self-centered and gave thanks that the
judgment would not happen immediately or to him.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God disciplined His people out of love</u>. Moses warned that
God would discipline the Jews as a loving father: “Thus you are to know
in your heart that the LORD your God was disciplining you just as a man
disciplines his son.” (Dt. 8:5; Heb. 12:6). Because the Jews would sin
again under Manasseh and fail to repent, God fulfilled His Word more
than a century later, in or around 586 B.C. (2 Kgs. 24:12-16; 2 Chron.
33:11; Dan. 1:3-4, 6). All of the remaining gold that Hezekiah showed
the Babylonians would be taken away: “<sup>11 </sup>Then the rest of the
people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to
the king of Babylon and the rest of the people, Nebuzaradan the captain
of the guard carried away into exile . . . <sup>13 </sup>Now the bronze
pillars which were in the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the stands and the bronze sea which
were in the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon . . .
<sup>15 </sup>The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and
the basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.” (2 Kgs.
20:11-15). Isaiah also stated that some of the Jews would be turned into
“<em>officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.</em>” (2 Kgs.
20:19). Daniel fulfilled this separate prophecy (Dan. 1:1-4). God’s Word
always comes true. Thus, believers should take God’s Word seriously.
Believers can do this by living as holy examples for others.</p></li>

<u>Mercy and Grace: God’s Mercy and Grace is Greater than Our Sins</u>.
2 Kgs. 20:20-21.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Despite his mistakes, God honors Hezekiah for his
faithfulness</u>. Despite Hezekiah’s sins, God showed His mercy and
grace by honoring Hezekiah for his faith-led obedience:
“<sup>20 </sup><em>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his
might, and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into
the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
Kings of Judah? <sup>21 </sup>So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and
Manasseh his son became king in his place</em>.” (2 Kgs. 20:20-21).
Hezekiah’s life would seem to end on a down note. Yet, he was the most
faithful and obedient king since David. And, David committed far worse
sins of adultery and murder. What made David truly unique was his
willingness to quickly repent and return to God each time he sinned (Ps.
51:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God honored Hezekiah for his faith-led obedience</u>. God
previously honored Hezekiah as the first king to destroy the pagan
altars. In the beginning of his reign, God celebrated his faith-led
obedience (2 Kgs. 18:3-5). At the end of his reign, God again celebrated
his obedience in building a water conduit system that protected the Jews
during Assyria’s assault (2 Kgs. 20:20). In 1880, archeologists
confirmed that Hezekiah built a 1,708-foot-long tunnel between the
spring of Gihon and the pool of Siloam (2 Chron. 32:30). Hezekiah also
received an honorary burial in the sepulchers where David was buried (2
Chr. 32:33). Thus, God was faithful to remember Hezekiah’s faith, not
his sins.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for God’s mercy and grace</u>. God’s celebration
of Hezekiah should give great hope to all believers. If you obey God in
faith-led obedience, God will celebrate your faith and forget your sins:
‘“I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own
sake, and I will not remember your sins.”’ (Is. 43:25). “Then the LORD
passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ‘The LORD, the LORD God,
compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in
lovingkindness and truth;”’ (Ex. 34:6). “For You, Lord, are good, and
ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon
You.” (Ps. 86:5). “The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger
and abounding in lovingkindness.” (Ps. 103:8). “Gracious is the LORD,
and righteous; yes, our God is compassionate.” (Ps. 116:5). Thus, God’s
mercy and grace includes both forgiving your sins and forgetting your
sins as well. How have you thanked Him?</p></li>
