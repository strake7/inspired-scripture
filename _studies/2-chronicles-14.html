<p><u>Introduction</u>: 2 Chronicles 14 through 16 tell the story of Judah’s third king, Asa. His life and his reign were a three-part tragedy. In this chapter, he showed great faith, and God blessed both him and all of Judah. God’s prophet then gave Asa a conditional promise that his faith-led obedience would lead to God’s blessings while acts of rebellion would cause God to remove His hand of protection. In the final chapter, Asa ignored these warnings and turned away from God. While Asa’s faith was tested with physical threats, most believers today are tested in the spiritual realm: “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:12). “for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.” (2 Cor. 10:4). From Asa’s initial reign, God reveals seven lessons regarding the blessings of faith. These include: (1) peace, (2) obedience, (3) spiritual prosperity, (4) courage, (5) dependence on God, (6) victory, and (7) provision.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, because of Asa’s initial faith-led obedience, God blessed all of Judah with ten years of peace. When you have faith, God will also bless you with His peace. <u>Second</u>, because of his faith, Asa obeyed God’s Word by removing most of the pagan idols. He did this even though idolatry had become both popular and wide-spread after Solomon’s reign. When you have faith, God will also give you the strength to obey His Word, even when it is unpopular to do so. <u>Third</u>, because of Asa’s initial faith-led obedience, all of Judah enjoyed development and prosperity. God may not bless you with wealth. Some people give into covetousness when they acquire too much wealth. Yet, when you have faith, God promises the blessing of spiritual prosperity. This is a feeling of contentment with whatever He gives you. <u>Fourth</u>, when faced with a large invading army of Egyptians, Asa inspired valiant warriors to step forward to fight them without fear. When you have faith, God also gives you the Spirit-led courage to face your enemies. <u>Fifth</u>, because of his faith, Asa cried out to God to deliver the Jews. When you have faith, you learn to depend upon God and not yourself. This in turn allows Him to fight your battles for you. <u>Sixth</u>, because of Asa’s faith, the Jews were victorious in their battle against the Ethiopians. When you have faith, God also brings the blessing of victory over your spiritual enemy. <u>Finally</u>, also because of their faith, God blessed the Jews with the spoils of victory. When you have faith, God also blesses you with His abundant provision. This also includes the gifts of the Spirit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Asa turns to God, and God blesses Judah</u>. Although Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah engaged in evil acts of rebellion, the next heir Asa broke with the sins of his fathers and initially turned Judah back to God. As a result, God blessed all of Judah with ten years of peace: “<sup>1</sup> <em>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and his son Asa became king in his place. The land was undisturbed for ten years during his days</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:1). Asa became Judah’s third king during the 20<sup>th</sup> year of Jeroboam’s reign as the first king of Northern Israel. Asa’s reign lasted 41 years, 911-870 B.C. (1 Kgs. 15:10). Thus, his reign lasted a year longer than both David and Solomon (1 Kgs. 2:11; 11:42). His reign also outlasted Rehoboam and Abijah and seven future kings of Northern Israel. These included Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Tibni, Omri, and Ahab. Because he initially walked in faith, all of Judah enjoyed the blessings of God’s peace.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith in Jesus brings the peace that surpasses all understanding</u>. Jesus is the Prince of Peace (Is. 9:6). When you have faith in Him, He promises a true peace that surpasses all understanding: “Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful.” (Col. 3:15). “For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 4:17). If your life is in turmoil, are you looking to Jesus for peace?</p></li>

<h2 id="obedience-faith-gives-you-the-strength-to-obey-gods-word.-2-chr.-142-5.">2. <u>Obedience: Faith Gives You the Strength to Obey God’s Word</u>. 2 Chr. 14:2-5.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asa initially obeyed God’s Word and removed most pagan worship centers</u>. Asa’s faith allowed him to take the politically unpopular move of removing most of the centers of pagan worship that had existed in Judah since Solomon’s reign: “<sup>2 </sup><em>Asa did good and right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God, <sup>3 </sup>for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherim, <sup>4 </sup>and commanded Judah to seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment. <sup>5 </sup>He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. And the kingdom was undisturbed under him</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:2-5). Under Rehoboam and Abijah, idolatry was pervasive in Judah (1 Kgs. 14:23-24; 2 Chr. 12:1). This means that it was no longer stigmatized as a sin. The evil practices that they permitted included sex temple prostitution (1 Kgs. 14:24; Dt. 16:22) and the use “Asherah” polls for worship, sexually explicit carvings associated with a Canaanite deity (1 Kgs. 14:24). Yet, Asa at first did right in the sight of the LORD. His name is an Arabic name that means “to heal”. He initially began to heal Judah from its open idolatry by removing the evil centers of idolatry and male prostitution: “<sup>11 </sup>Asa did what was right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, like David his father. <sup>12 </sup>He also put away the male cult prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.” (1 Kgs. 15:12-15). Making these reforms, however, would have been highly unpopular. Because Solomon and the first two kings of Judah allowed for this idolatry, the people would have likely resisted Asa’s reforms. Without faith, Asa would not have likely had the courage to initially follow God’s Word.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Asa initially succeeded in personal obedience, yet failed by tolerating evil</u>. Asa’s initial reign included seven faith-led acts of obedience that brought God’s blessings. These included: (1) initially having a heart devoted to God like David (1 Kgs. 15:11); (2) putting away the male cult prostitutes (1 Kgs. 15:12; 14:24); (3) removing idols made by his father Abijah, his grandfather Rehoboam, and his great grandfather Solomon (1 Kgs. 15:12; 11:7); (4) removing Maacah as queen mother and burning an Asherah idol that she used to mislead others (1 Kgs. 15:13); (5) restoring the dedicated holy things that had been removed from the Temple (1 Kgs. 15:15); (6) he “commanded Judah to seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of their fathers and to observe the law and the commandment” (2 Chr. 14:4) and (7) he showed faith and inspired his soldiers to have faith during an Ethiopian invasion (2 Chr. 14:11). His obedience, however, was not complete. He failed to rip down all of the cultic temples left by the Canaanites, Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah. He decided that tolerance was a virtue. Yet, because he tolerated what God called evil, both he and future generations would fall back into rebellion against God (1 Kgs. 15:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Tolerance is not a virtue when it leads you or others to rebel against God’s Word</u>. To accommodate the religious beliefs of his pagan subjects and wives, Solomon built a special pagan worship temple to the Moabite god “Chemosh” and the Ammonite god “Molech” (1 Kgs. 11:7). Like Molech, worship to Chemosh frequently included the disgusting use of innocent children as burnt offerings (2 Kgs. 3:27). Solomon’s tolerance would have been praised today as a virtue. Yet, God warned the Jews not to use pagan altars for worship (Dt. 12:12-13; 1 Kgs. 13:32; Jer. 7:31). Whenever the Jews came across pagan altars, they were ordered to destroy them: “then <em>you shall . . . destroy all their figured stones . . . and demolish all their high places</em>;” (Nu. 33:52). “<em>You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods</em>, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree. You shall tear down their altars . . .” (Dt. 12:2-3). Failing to observe this rule would eventually cause the Jews to blend their worship of God with Canaanite pagan practices: “ . . . For on every high hill and under every green tree you have lain down as a harlot.” (Jer. 2:20). Solomon did the exact opposite of what God commanded by building these temples. And these temples would stumble Israel for generations to come. King Jeroboam later followed after Solomon’s example and built altars for idol worship with unauthorized priests (1 Kgs. 12:31). King Manasseh later follow after Solomon’s example and rebuilt pagan altars after King Hezekiah destroyed them (2 Kgs. 21:3). Solomon believed that it was wise to tolerate the different religious practices of others. Yet, when tolerance leads someone into direct rebellion against God’s Word, it is not a virtue. You are called upon to destroy any unholy idol in your life. Is there anything you need to purge?</p></li>
<li><p><u>You cannot have dual allegiances between God and other things</u>. Many people serve God intensely. Yet, our service to God is frequently divided. Once we understand that God will not accept divided allegiances, we realize how frequently we fall short in complying with this commandment: “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.” (Matt. 6:24; Lk. 16:13). “You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” (Jam. 4:4). “For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.” (Gal. 1:10). “And Elijah came near to all the people and said, ‘How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is god, then follow him.’ And the people did not answer him a word.” (1 Kin. 18:21; Josh. 24:15). The Jews saw nothing wrong with worshiping both God and the pagan idols of fertility. Yet, this was offensive to God. It suggested that Canaanite idols were better at ensuring fertility. If you are “double minded” by giving God less than your full devotion, you need to repent.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God warned David’s heirs that their success depended upon their full obedience</u>. Before his death, David warned Solomon (and his heirs) that success would depend upon their obedience: “Keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to what is written in the Law of Moses, that you may succeed in all that you do and wherever you turn,” (1 Kgs. 2:3). God also repeated these warnings to Solomon on two separate occasions (1 Kgs. 3:5; 9:2). All kings were further required to keep a personal copy of the law to make sure that they followed it as king: “Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.” (Dt. 17:18). Thus, David’s heirs had no excuse for disobedience. Each knew that their success depended upon faith-led obedience. Are you being disobedient to God in any area of your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Obey God’s Word, even when it is unpopular</u>. Throughout the Bible, God reminds His people that vows of obedience must be followed by action. e.g., “And the LORD said to me, ‘Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant <em>and do them</em>.”’’ (Jer. 11:6). In case anyone believes that these are relics of the Old Testament, they are repeated even more often in the New Testament: “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and <em>do not do what I say</em>?” (Lk. 6:46). “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but <em>he who does the will of My</em> Father who is in heaven will enter.” (Matt. 7:21). “Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and <em>acts on them</em>, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.” (Matt. 7:24-25). “[F]or it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but <em>the doers of the Law will be justified</em>.” (Ro. 2:13). “But <em>prove yourselves doers of the word</em>, and not merely hearers who delude themselves.” (Jam. 1:22; see also, Rev. 14:12; 22:14). Are you obeying His Word only when it is popular?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith gives you the discipline to obey</u>. Asa’s reforms would have offended many. He could be popular by tolerating pagan idolatry. Or, he could do what was right by following God’s Word. It was faith that gave Asa the courage to initially do what was right. Faith will also give you the strength to obey God’s Word when it is unpopular.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spiritual-prosperity-faith-brings-the-blessing-of-spiritual-prosperity.-2-chr.-146-7.">3. <u>Spiritual Prosperity: Faith Brings the Blessing of Spiritual Prosperity</u>. 2 Chr. 14:6-7.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Because of Asa’ obedience, God blessed all of Judah with prosperity</u>. Because Asa initially had the faith to obey His Word over public opinion, God blessed Judah with development and prosperity: “<sup>6 </sup><em>He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was undisturbed, and there was no one at war with him during those years, because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had given him rest. <sup>7 </sup>For he said to Judah, ‘Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.’ So they built and prospered</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:6-7). Asa did not build up Judah to be self-reliant. Instead, he used the blessing of peace to engage in civil development. All of the Jews prospered through the peace and civil development that resulted from Asa’s reforms.</p></li>
<li><p><u>An obedient nation may be blessed with prosperity</u>. God can bless an obedient nation with prosperity: “<sup>8 </sup>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will command the blessing upon you in your barns and in all that you put your hand to, and He will bless you in the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God gives you.” (Dt. 28:8). Those with faith who give to the poor may also be blessed with prosperity: “You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.” (Dt. 15:10). “The generous man will be prosperous, and he who waters will himself be watered.” (Prov. 11:25; 3:10). “He who is generous will be blessed, for he gives some of his food to the poor.” (Prov. 22:9). “One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” (Prov. 19:17). Giving is also the one area where God invites you to test Him in faith: ‘“Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,’ says the LORD of hosts, ‘if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.’” (Mal. 3:10). God’s promises are repeated in the New Testament: “Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.” (2 Cor. 9:6). As a result of his faith and obedience, God richly blessed Abraham (Gen. 13:2; 12:16). Likewise, as a result of his faith and obedience during his trials, God also richly blessed Job by doubling what he had before his trials (Job: 42:10-17). The one exception to this rule is if you are giving with the wrong motives. The love of money is evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Greed is also evil (Ro. 1:29; 1 Cor. 5:10-11; 6:10; Eph. 5:5). Thus, God will not bless you with money if you are giving out of a desire to become rich.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith will lead to spiritual prosperity</u>. Although some may not see the blessing of physical prosperity (especially when it breeds covetousness), those with faith will receive spiritual prosperity. This may include rewards that are stored up in heaven. “But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;” (Matt. 6:20). This can also include contentment with what you have. Bible reveals that “godliness with contentment” is “great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6). “Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have . . .,”’ (Heb. 13:5). If you have faith, you will feel the riches of His love.</p></li>

<h2 id="courage-faith-gives-you-spirit-led-courage-to-face-your-enemies.-2-chr.-148-10.">4. <u>Courage: Faith Gives You Spirit-Led Courage to Face Your Enemies</u>. 2 Chr. 14:8-10.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asa and his soldiers face a far larger Ethiopian army with courage</u>. Because of his faith, Asa inspired his soldiers to be valiant and face a far larger Ethiopian army: “<sup>8 </sup><em>Now Asa had an army of 300,000 from Judah, bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, bearing shields and wielding bows; all of them were valiant warriors. <sup>9 </sup>Now Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and he came to Mareshah. <sup>10 </sup>So Asa went out to meet him, and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:8-10). Between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, Asa had 580,000 “valiant warriors.” Yet, the Ethiopians enjoyed a numerical advantage of almost two to one with a million men. They further had a tactical advantage with 300 chariots that could be used to encircle the Jews.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Holy Spirit will give you the courage or strength to serve Him</u>. Like the “valiant warriors”, the Holy Spirit will also give you courage or strength to face your challenges or enemies: “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7). Moses also encouraged the Jews not to fear their enemies: “When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, <em>do not be afraid of them</em>; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you.” (Dt. 20:1). “He shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel, you are approaching the battle against your enemies today. Do not be fainthearted. <em>Do not be afraid</em>, or panic, or tremble before them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’” (Dt. 20:3-4; 31:8). The next time you fear, recite His promises: “Do not fear for I am with you; do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand . . . Do not fear, I will help you.” (Is. 41:10, 13). If you are facing trials, turn to God to allow the Holy Spirit to strengthen you.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependence-faith-helps-you-to-depend-upon-god-and-not-yourself.-2-chr.-1411.">5. <u>Dependence: Faith Helps You to Depend Upon God and Not Yourself</u>. 2 Chr. 14:11.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Asa cries out to God to deliver the Jews in battle</u>. Because of his faith, Asa depended upon God to prevail in battle: “<sup>11 </sup><em>Then Asa called to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God and said, ‘<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, there is no one besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; so help us, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, You are our God; let not man prevail against You</em>.’” (2 Chr. 14:11). Asa initially had a heart devoted to God like David (1 Kgs. 15:11). Thus, like David, he cried out for God to deliver them. His faith allowed him to see that the Jews could prevail in battle if they depended upon God and not themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God protects those who put their trust and dependence upon Him</u>. When you are in need of deliverance, cry out to God as part of your regular worship: “O LORD, how my adversaries have increased! Many are rising up against me. Many are saying of my soul, ‘There is no deliverance for him in God.’ Selah. But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. I was crying to the LORD with my voice, and He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah. I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about.” (Ps. 3:1-6; 25:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you trust in God and do His will, you have no reason to fear your enemies</u>. Because God was David’s rock and his refuge, he never feared his enemies: “I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about.” (Ps. 3:6). “Though a host encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war arise against me, in spite of this I shall be confident.” (Ps. 27:3). When Goliath approached David, David charged at him without fear: “Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.” (1 Sam. 17:48). If you are walking in faith in Jesus, you have no reason to fear your enemies. “And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant—” (Lk. 1:69). If you fear any enemy, give that fear to Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Depend upon Jesus as your only savior</u>. Throughout the Jews’ history, God had repeatedly delivered them. He was their only deliverer: “I, even I, am the LORD, and there is no savior besides Me.” (Is. 43:11). “Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: ‘I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.”’ (Is. 44:6). “Do not tremble and do not be afraid; have I not long since announced it to you and declared it? And you are My witnesses. Is there any God besides Me, or is there any other Rock? I know of none.” (Is. 44:8; Hos. 13:4). Jesus is also your only savior (1 Jo. 4:14; Lk. 2:11; Jo. 3:16). He wants you to depend upon Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in God, not in powerful people</u>. Asa’s warriors did not put their trust in their strong king or in themselves. God also does not want you to put your trust in powerful people: “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). “Do not trust in princes, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.” (Ps. 118:9). Frequently, God’s righteousness and His desire that you lean on Him will appear foolish to the world. “For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Cor. 1:18). “But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Cor. 2:14). “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). Today, people regularly become filled with hope in their favorite political candidate. Yet, these people cannot save you. Have you placed your hope in Jesus or in powerful people?</p></li>

<h2 id="victory-faith-brings-the-blessing-of-victory-over-the-enemy.-2-chr.-1412-13.">6. <u>Victory: Faith Brings the Blessing of Victory Over the Enemy</u>. 2 Chr. 14:12-13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God gives the Jews victory over the Ethiopian army</u>. Because of Asa’s faith, God blessed the Jews with a victory over the Ethiopian army: “<sup>12 </sup><em>So the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. <sup>13 </sup>Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar; and so many Ethiopians fell that they could not recover, for they were shattered before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and before His army</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:12-13). The Bible is clear that “<em>the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> routed the Ethiopians</em>” and that the Jews were serving in “<em>His army</em>.” Thus, there was no room for the Jews to take any credit.</p></li>
<li><p><u>An obedient nation will be blessed with protection</u>. God will also bless an obedient nation with protection against their enemies: “<sup>7 </sup>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you one way and will flee before you seven ways.” (Dt. 28:7). When the Jews followed God’s Word, He also promised victory (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22; Nu 10:9, 35; Isa. 54:17; Gen. 22:17). For those who are obedient and take refuge in God in the face of the enemy, He promises to be a shield against the enemy’s fiery darts: “He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5(b); 2 Sam. 22:31). With God’s help, Jonathon killed 20 enemy soldiers (1 Sam. 14:14). Likewise, it was God’s blessing that allowed David to kill Goliath (1 Sam. 17:50-58). God also used Gideon’s small army of only 300 soldiers to kill 120,000 enemy Midianites (Jdgs. 7:16-22; 8:10). Another type of protection that God offers is protection from the enemy’s attacks on your health: “And He said, ‘If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer.’” (Ex. 15:26; Dt. 7:15). Do you call out to God when you are under attack?</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God blesses the Jews with the spoils of war</u>. Also because of their faith, God blessed Judah with the spoils of war following their victory over the Ethiopians: “<em>And they carried away very much plunder. <sup>14 </sup>They destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had fallen on them; and they despoiled all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. <sup>15 </sup>They also struck down those who owned livestock, and they carried away large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem</em>.” (2 Chr. 14:14-15). God does not bless every faithful servant with physical prosperity because wealth causes some people to covet even more wealth. God will not give believers things that will stumble them or cause them to sin. Yet, when you are faithful, God will bless you with spiritual prosperity. This is a feeling of contentment with whatever He has given you. He will also bless you with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you have faith, God will provide for your needs</u>. When the Jews had faith-led obedience, God promised to provide for their needs, not their wants: “<sup>3 </sup>If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out, <sup>4 </sup>then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit. <sup>5 </sup>Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land.” (Lev. 26:3-5). Rain is a symbol of God’s blessings (Dt. 11:10-17; 32:1-3; 1 Ki. 8:34-35; 18:41-46). Thus, the blessing of provision is sometimes called “raiment.” In terms of their food needs, the Jews would also live securely within the land: “Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.” (Dt. 28:5). “If you consent and obey, you will eat the best of the land;” (Is. 1:19). Because of Isaac’s faith and obedience, God blessed his harvest 100 fold (Gen. 26:12). Jesus also promises to provide for our food, water, and clothes when we pursue His righteousness (Matt. 6:33). Are you being obedient to receive His provision?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seize the gifts of the Spirit to serve Jesus.</u> Jesus promised that He would send the Holy Spirit to help believers to remember His Word and apply it to their lives. “But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.” (Jo. 14:26, 16; 15:26; 16:13). The Holy Spirit also promises to provide you with gifts in order to serve Him: “For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; <sup>9 </sup>to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, <sup>10 </sup>and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.” (1 Cor. 12:8-10). What do you need to do to receive the gifts of the Spirit? According to Peter, you only need to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ: “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and <em>you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit</em>. <sup>39 </sup>For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.”’ (Acts 2:38-39). Are you seeking to seize the gifts of the Spirit to serve Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Use the gifts of the Spirit to restore others</u>. God gave the Jews gifts so that they could help each other when they were in need. With the gifts of the Spirit, you are also called upon to restore others in love: “Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.” (Gal. 6:1). “My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,” (Jam. 5:19). Are you using the gifts of the Spirit to restore others lost to sin?</p></li>
