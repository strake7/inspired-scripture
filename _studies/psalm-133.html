<p><u>Introduction</u>: This is the fourteenth Song of Ascents (Ps. 120–134). Psalms 133, 131, and 134 are all tied as the second shortest psalms, each with three verses. “<em>A Song of Ascents, of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong></em> <em>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity! <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It is like the precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, as on Aaron’s beard, the oil which ran down upon the edge of his robes. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded the blessing there—life forever</em>.” (Ps. 133:1-3).</p>
<p>The pilgrims returning to Jerusalem following the exile sang this Psalm as they assembled together to worship God. In modern translations, David is listed as the author. But the Greek Septuagint and some Hebrew manuscripts do not contain the words “of David.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Regardless of who wrote this Psalm, it was important for the unity of the Jews. After Solomon’s death in 931 B.C., the nation of Israel became divided into two kingdoms. Between 732 and 722 B.C., the Assyrians carried off most of the people of the northern Kingdom of Israel in different waves. Between 605 and 582 B.C., the Babylonians carried off most of the people of the southern Kingdom of Judah in different waves. In 539 BC, King Cyrus II of Persia, permitted the Jews to return to Jerusalem. But the Jews were still subjects of the Persian empire. Also, the Samaritans wanted the Jews to follow a religion that mixed Judaism with pagan beliefs. Here, the psalmist sought to remind the Jews of the blessing of living in the unity God intended. Through the revelation of the New Testament, this is revealed to be Spirit-led unity. From Psalm 133 and the complete revelation of Scripture, God reveals seven lessons for achieving God’s intended Church unity. Proper Church unity should: (1) fulfill God’s will, (2) bring proper harmony, (3) submit to the Spirit, (4) empower service for God, (5) be rooted in God’s definition of holiness, (6) bring God’s living waters to others, and (7) submit to the promised Messiah Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist used the Hebrew word for good to extol the virtue of God’s unity. When this word was first used in the context of mankind, it described the blessing of a unified Adam and Eve. Just as creation was perfect and united when God first created it, the unity of the Church should fulfill God’s will and His purpose. <u>Second</u>, when the Church lives together according to God’s intended plan, it is both “good” and “pleasant”. The unity of the Church should bring a harmony that is grounded in His Word. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist described God’s unity as being like the oil used for the consecration of the priests. The oil symbolized the Holy Spirit. Like the visible oil running down the priest, God’s unity should be visible and submit to the Holy Spirit. <u>Fourth</u>, after the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the priest was empowered to serve others for God. Unity in the Church should also be expressed through Spirit-led service towards others. <u>Fifth</u>, the oil pouring down the priest also symbolized holiness. Unity in the Church should be rooted in God’s definition of holiness, not what is considered popular under worldly traditions. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist believed that unity would be like the life-giving dew found on Mount Hermon. The water on this tall mountain provided life. God’s unity within the Church should also spread His Word of life to all peoples. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist extolled a unity that would last forever. This foreshadowed the promised Messiah. Church unity should also submit to Jesus’ will.</p>
<h2 id="gods-will-god-desires-spirit-led-unity-that-fulfills-his-will.-ps.-1331."><strong>1. <u>God’s Will: God Desires Spirit-Led Unity That Fulfills His Will</u>. Ps. 133:1.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church unity that fulfills God’s plan is “good”</u>. The psalmist proclaimed that it was “good” for God’s people to be united in the manner He intended. “<strong><em><sup>1</sup></em></strong> <em>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!</em>” (Ps. 133:1). “The phrase ‘how good’ translates from the Hebrew word ‘<span dir="rtl">טוֹב</span>’ (tov), which conveys a sense of moral goodness, beauty, and pleasantness. In the biblical context, ‘good’ often refers to something that aligns with God’s will and purpose. This goodness is not merely subjective but is rooted in the divine order, suggesting that unity among believers is inherently aligned with God’s design for humanity.” (Berean Study Bible on Ps. 133:1).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s first family was united and “very good” before sin corrupted it</u>. The triune God created mankind in His image and then gave it the right to be stewards over His creation. “ <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Then God said, ‘Let Us make mankind in Our image, according to Our likeness....”’ (Gen. 1:26a). The triune God created mankind as men and women to be joined together as one flesh and populate the Earth (Gen. 1:27-28). Jesus later affirmed that God meant for one man and one woman to become united as one. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>and [He] said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’” (Matt. 19:5; Gen. 2:24). Along with all creation, God looked upon the unity of a man and a woman coming together as one in marriage and described it as “very good”. “And God saw all that He had made, and behold, <em>it was very good</em>. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.” (Gen. 1:31). Much like the first family before sin, a united Church that lives according to God’s purpose is “very good”.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When the Church is united for Jesus, it is also good to God</u>. God desires that all creation and His people be united for Him, just as creation was in the beginning before sin corrupted it. “Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus, so that <em>with one purpose and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>.” (Ro. 15:5-6). “He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He set forth in Him, regarding His plan of the fullness of the times, <em>to bring all things together in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth</em>.” (Eph. 1:9-10). Thus, leaders should pray to ensure that any endeavor seeks to fulfill God’s will.</p></li>

<h2 id="harmony-god-desires-spirit-led-harmony-in-the-church.-ps.-1331b."><strong>2. <u>Harmony: God Desires Spirit-Led Harmony in the Church</u>. Ps. 133:1b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church harmony that is according to God’s will is also pleasant to Him</u>. To encourage the returning Jews, the psalmist stressed that is was “<em>pleasant” “for brothers to live together in unity!</em>” (Ps. 133:1b). “The phrase ‘in harmony’ translates the Hebrew ‘<span dir="rtl">יָחַד</span>’ (yachad), which means togetherness or unity. This word conveys a sense of oneness and agreement, where differences are reconciled, and individuals work towards a common goal. In the biblical narrative, harmony is often associated with peace (shalom) and the absence of conflict. It is a state of being that reflects God’s kingdom, where love and cooperation prevail over division and strife.” (Berean Study Bible on Ps. 133:1).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-133/media/image1.jpg" style="width:5.97015in;height:2.43585in" alt="Psalm 133:1 - Bible verse - DailyVerses.net" /></p>
<p>Spirit-led unity should bring the Church together in harmony and brotherly love<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A unity that does not exist for God’s glory is neither good nor pleasant</u>. When mankind united as one for its own glory, the triune God divided the peoples to prevent them from fulfilling a desired unity that would have set them apart from God: “<sup>5 </sup>The Lord<em> </em>came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. <sup>6 </sup>The Lord<em> </em>said, ‘Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them<em>.</em>” (Gen. 11:5-6).  Likewise, when the patriarchs were united for the wrong purpose, it also was not pleasing to God. “For <em>brethren</em> according to the flesh to dwell together is not always wise; for experience teaches that they are better a little apart, and it is shameful for them to dwell together in disunion. They had much better part in peace like Abraham and Lot, than dwell together in envy like Joseph’s brothers.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 133:1) (italics original).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Again, leaders should pray for God to guide their endeavors. A united endeavor that exists for mankind’s glory is neither good nor pleasant to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>When living for God’s purpose, there should be harmony within the Church</u>. When the Church acts to serve Jesus’ Kingdom, He will bless its united purpose with harmony. “I am not asking on behalf of these alone, but also for those who believe in Me through their word, <em>that they may all be one</em>; just as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me. I in them and You in Me, <em>that they may be perfected in unity</em>, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and You loved them, just as You loved Me.” (Jo. 17:20-23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Godly harmony also requires vigilance to prevent Satan from dividing it</u>. Unfortunately, sin will naturally lead to disorder and conflict unless the Church is vigilant in seeking to preserve Spirit-led unity, “<em>being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</em>. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you also were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.” (Eph. 4:3-6). “Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (1 Cor. 1:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Godly unity shares a common purpose, but with each person having a different function</u>. Having a Church that is united for God does not mean that each person must perform the same role. Instead, each person should use their God-given gifts to benefit the united Church as it seeks to fulfill God’s will for it. “For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.” (1 Cor. 12:12-13). Each person must commit to actively serving to fulfill Jesus’ Christ’s Kingdom on Earth “But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.” (1 Cor. 6:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Church unity is good and pleasant to God when it is rooted in His love</u>. How do you know if the Church is united for a godly purpose? If it is united for God, it is united through love for Him and others. “In addition to all these things <em>put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity</em> … So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience; bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so must you do also. In addition to all these things <em>put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity</em>.” (Col. 3:4, 12-14). “Be devoted to one another in <em>brotherly love</em>; give preference to one another in honor,” (Ro. 12:10). “To sum up, all of you <em>be harmonious, sympathetic, loving, compassionate, and humble</em>;” (1 Pet. 3:8). “Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind, <em>maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose</em>.” (Phil. 2:1-2). As our example, the early Church lived together in loving unity. They sought to attend to each other’s needs while also serving to build Jesus’ Church (Acts 2).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-holy-spirit-church-unity-must-submit-to-the-holy-spirit.-ps.-1332."><strong>3. <u>The Holy Spirit: Church Unity Must Submit to the Holy Spirit</u>. Ps. 133:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church unity must be led by the Holy Spirit</u>. The psalmist used symbolism from the oil used for the ordination of the priests to stress the type of unity that God desires for His people. “<em><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It is like the precious oil on the head, running down upon the beard, as on Aaron’s beard, the oil which ran down upon the edge of his robes.</em>” (Ps. 133:2). In the Bible, oil symbolizes the anointing of the Holy Spirit. “So Samuel took <em>the horn of oil and anointed him</em> in the midst of his brothers; <em>and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David</em> from that day forward. And Samuel set out and went to Ramah.” (1 Sam. 16:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Through faith, you become part of Jesus’ royal priesthood</u>. When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, He can also make you one of His priests. “But you are a chosen people, <em>a royal priesthood</em>, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Pet. 2:9). “and He made us into a kingdom, <em>priests to His God and Father</em>—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.” (Rev. 1:6).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-133/media/image2.jpg" style="width:5.9832in;height:2.49672in" alt="Anointing Oil | Bible, Priest, Gospel of luke" /></p>
<p>The Church must also be anointed by the Holy Spirit and submit to His will<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church unity must submit to the Spirit</u>. To serve as a priest, Moses poured oil on Aaron’s head. “Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.” (Lev. 8:12). “Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.” (Ex. 29:7). The oil being poured onto the heads of kings and priests symbolized the immersion of the Spirit, like a baptism. The Church should also be anointed by the Spirit in all that it does: “But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.” (1 Jo. 2:20). “Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,” (1 Cor. 1:21). “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (Ro. 8:14). Are you praying for the Holy Spirit to direct you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s Word and prayer allows the Holy Spirit to guide the Church</u>. All leaders are in need of God’s guidance. Without God’s guidance, leaders risk committing the sin of presumption  (Jam. 4:13-17).  “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.”  (Prov. 14:12).  To find it, leaders need to read God’s Word and pray for the Spirit to apply it to the Church: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105; Prov. 6:23). “I know, O LORD, that a man’s way is not in himself, nor is it in a man who walks to direct his steps.”  (Jer. 10:23). “And so we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:19). When leaders pray over God’s Word, the Holy Spirit can then apply it to the Church:  “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;”  (Jo. 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7; Ro. 8:26).  He will also guide leaders when they seek wisdom:  “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.”  (Ja. 1:5.)  Thus, leaders must seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit by studying God’s Word and prayer.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Church leaders must also be accountable to one another to stay on the right path</u>.  The pouring of the oil over all the priest’s garments was a visible act for all to see (Ps. 133:2). The ordination of the priests also took place in front of the Tent of Meeting for all to see  (Ex. 29:4, 10). The process was public to ensure that the priests would be held accountable.  Believers are also encouraged to be accountable toward others.  For this reason, believers are admonished not to forsake the fellowship of other believers.  “[L]et us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.”  (Heb. 10:24-25).  Thus, every church body and church leader must have someone or some organization to ensure their accountability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-spirit-led-unity-empowers-gods-people-to-serve.-ps.-1332."><strong>4. <u>Service: Spirit-Led Unity Empowers God’s People to Serve</u>. Ps. 133:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church unity should exist to serve God and others in need</u>. The anointing of the priests with oil also empowered them for service (Ps. 133:2). Priests did not seek to serve their needs. Instead, the priests received God’s anointing to serve Him. “And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, <em>so that they may serve as priests to Me</em>.” (Ex. 30:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The unified Church should reflect God’s love through service</u>. The Church should not exist merely to enrich itself and its members. Instead, just like the ordained priests, it is meant to reflect God’s love for those in need. It must: “do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.” (Micah 6:8). “Learn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, [and] plead<em> </em>for the widow.” (Is. 1:17). “Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the rights of the afflicted and needy.” (Prov. 31:9). “The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor, the wicked does not understand such concern.” (Prov. 29:7). “He who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker, but he who is gracious to the needy honors Him.” (Prov. 14:31). “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.” (Ps. 82:3). “He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing<em>.</em>” (Dt. 10:18). Is Jesus’ love for others visible through your church’s service to people in need?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When the Church is serving God and others in need, it is both good and pleasant</u>. God also anointed the priests to service Him by reconciling others to Him. “The oil upon the priest’s head …was part of his consecration to priestly service (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Exodus+29.7&amp;t=NKJV">Exodus 29:7</a>), which led to so many other good things. · Service unto God and His people. · Atonement of sins. · Offerings of peace, fellowship, and thanksgiving. · Compassionate ministry to the people of God. The illustration is wonderful. When there is unity among God’s people, it is not only good and pleasant in itself, but it also leads to so many other good things. When the people of God struggle with each other, there are so many other good things they are not doing and enjoying. God intended the priests to represent His righteousness and salvation to a watching world. Spiritually speaking, this anointing made that possible. Unity among God’s people has a similar effect.” (David Guzik on Ps. 133:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>

<h2 id="holiness-church-unity-must-be-rooted-in-gods-holiness.-ps.-1332."><strong>5. <u>Holiness: Church Unity Must Be Rooted in God’s Holiness</u>. Ps. 133:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Church unity should be rooted in God’s definition of holiness</u>. The psalmist used the ordination process of the priests for another important reason (Ps. 133:2). It stressed the importance of holiness in unity. When God anointed the priests with oil, it was also to “consecrate” them (Ex. 30:30; Lev. 8:12). This means that they were meant to be holy.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Church unity should be holy and fully devoted to God</u>. In the Bible, the oil used in the ordination was both expensive, and it was meant for God’s exclusive use. “This ointment was holy … It was very precious, and the like to it was not to be made for any common use. Thus holy love is, in the sight of God, of great price; and that is precious indeed which is so in God’s sight. It was grateful both to Aaron himself and to all about him. So is holy love; it is like <em>ointment and perfume which rejoice the heart.</em> Christ’s love to mankind was part of that <em>oil of gladness</em> with which he was <em>anointed above his fellows.</em> Aaron and his sons were not admitted to minister unto the Lord till they were anointed with this ointment, nor are our services acceptable to God without this holy love; if we have it not we are nothing, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage?q=1Co+13:1,2&amp;t=niv">1 Cor 13 1, 2</a>.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 133:2).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Church must be holy because God is holy</u>.  Along with serving those in need, being “unstained by the world” are the two parts of “true religion.”  (Jam. 1:27).  Jesus further promises to bless those who stay pure: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”  (Matt. 5:8).  He wants the Church to be holy because He is holy:  “you shall be holy, for I am holy.”  (1 Pet. 1:16; Lev. 11:44-5; 19:2; 20:7).  The pathway to heaven is also only available to those who are made pure through faith in Him: “A highway will be there, a roadway, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness.  The unclean will not travel on it, . . .”  (Is. 35:8).  Thus, the Church must remain holy in its service to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus can clothe the Church with His righteousness</u>. In Psalm 133, the oil poured from the head to cover the priest’s clothes all the way to the edges (Ps. 133:2). In the Bible, clothing is a symbol of both God’s provision and a person’s outward actions. After Adam and Eve sinned, God gave them animal skins to wear (Gen. 3:21). After the priest sacrificed an animal without blemish, God ordered that the priests use the animal skins to make clothing to serve Him (Lev. 1:6; 7:8). When you seek after Jesus’ kingdom and His righteousness, He also promises to clothe you (Matt. 6:33; Lk. 12:31). He further offers to clothe you in His fine clothes in heaven: “He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments;...” (Rev. 3:5). If Jesus does not clothe you, your acts will be looked upon as filthy rags: “For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; . . . ” (Is. 64:6). The person who tries to show up in heaven without Jesus’ clothes will be thrown out (Matt. 22:11-13). The message here is that the Church’s actions must seek to glorify Jesus or they are mere filthy rags to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Church must remain rooted in the Word to stay holy</u>. God’s Word and society frequently have different definitions of good and evil. When church leaders seek to grow their congregations, some face the temptation to preach only what is popular and avoid that which is controversial. But the entirety of God’s Word was meant to correct and edify. “All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness;” (2 Tim. 3:16). The Church was also meant to be both a light to the lost and an irritant in the wounds of sin. “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by people.” (Matt. 5:13). God also warns against those who redefine as “good” that which He defines as “evil”. “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!” (Is. 5:20). Thus, to stay holy, the Church must closely adhere to God’s Word as the ultimate truth.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Church was meant to share God’s living water</u>. As an analogy for “good” and “pleasant” unity, the psalmist said, “<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion; ..</em>.” (Ps. 133:3a). Mount Hermon is part of the Promised Land. But today its peak sits between Syria and Lebanon. Its peak is 2,814 m (9,232 ft) above sea level, and it receives an average annual precipitation of 1,300 mm.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Its snowmelt and rain also bring life to many dry areas. It is also the most important source of water for the Jordan River.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In contrast, Mount Zion is only 765 m (2,510 ft) above sea level, and its average annual precipitation is only 330 mm.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The two mountains further are over 400 kilometers apart, and water does not flow between the two. Thus, this was a supernatural provision of water to God’s holy mountain. “The word translated “falling” [coming down] here is the same word we saw for “running down” in verse two. Once again God’s blessing of unity comes down to us from heaven. It is something we receive from the Lord. Apart from God’s blessing we are like the dry, arid land of Mount Zion, but God sends his blessing upon us like the dew of Mount Hermon.” (Ray Fowler on Ps. 133:3).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the living water that comes from heaven and transform you</u>. Jesus provides the water of life to all who believe in Him as Lord and Savior. His word also supernaturally transforms that which was once dry and barren. “but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.” (Jo. 4:14). When Jesus marries the Church in heaven, He will provide His living water for all eternity. “The Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who hears say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires, take the water of life without cost.” (Rev. 22:17).</p></li>

In both the Old and New Testament times, God meant for His people to be light to the lost and share His living water: “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; <em>I will also make You a light of the nations</em> so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.’’ (Is. 49:6). “<em>You are the light of the world</em>. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;” (Matt. 5:14). This is also part of the Great Commission (Matt. 28:16-20). Thus, the united Church is “good” and “pleasant” when it evangelizes the lost.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The Church will one day dwell in eternal unity</u>. In reference to Mount Zion where God will supernaturally provide His living waters, God’s people will one day dwell in eternal unity, harmony, and perfect love. “<em><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>… for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded the blessing there—life forever</em>.” (Ps. 133:3b). “O come the day when division shall cease, and enmity be done away; when the tribes of the spiritual Israel shall be united in a bond of eternal charity, under the true David, in the Jerusalem which is above, and saints and angels shall sing this lovely Psalm together!” (Albert Benson’s Commentary on Ps. 133:3b).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the head of the Church, and the Church must submit to Him</u>. Jesus will come to restore what was once “good” and “pleasant”. While sin corrupted the first marriage between Adam and Eve, Jesus will one day marry His Church and restore perfect unity, harmony, peace, and love. “Let’s rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His bride has prepared herself. It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Rev. 19:7-8). Thus, for perfect unity to exist, the Church must submit to Jesus, its bridegroom. “For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.” (Eph. 5:23).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus and His Church will dwell together in perfect unity</u>. The final verse in Psalm 133 directly connects to Jesus. “Yahweh has commanded, ordained, that his people will dwell in his place, enjoying his goodness under the reign of his king forever. Nothing can stop it, not even death. The king will come. The fortunes will be restored. The priest will be anointed. The land will be verdant, impossibly green, and brothers will dwell in unity.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 133:3).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> All conflict will come to an end when He returns and claims His bride. “And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the young lion and the fattened steer will be together; and a little boy will lead them.” (Is. 11:6). “They will no longer hunger nor thirst, nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any scorching heat; for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs of the water of life; and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:16-17).</p></li>
