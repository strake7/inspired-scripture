<p><u>Introduction</u>: For several reasons, Proverbs 8 is significant. First, Solomon draws a contrast here between the adulterous woman’s false wisdom in Proverbs 7 with Yahweh’s true wisdom. Second, because the adulterous woman foreshadows the spiritual harlot who will lead many people away from the faith in Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Rev. 17:3</a>), Proverbs 8 plays an important role in warning people to pick Jesus’ way of truth over the enemy’s lies. Third, Proverbs 8 is the only place in the Bible to define the meaning of the term “to fear the LORD.” Fourth, an early Church debate over Jesus’ depiction in Proverbs 8 in part led to the formation of the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. and the development of the doctrine of the Trinity. Fifth, in Proverbs 8, Solomon reveals several lessons about the wisdom that Jesus shares with all believers. His wisdom is: (1) a free gift to all believers, (2) it offers truth and righteousness, (3) it offers knowledge and discernment, (4) it offers a path to Jesus’ loving fellowship, (5) it offers His eternal knowledge through the Holy Spirit, (6) it offers a pathway to a blessed life when followed, and (7) it offers eternal life.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, like the man who gave into the temptation of the adulterous woman, all have fallen short and need redemption. Solomon described Yahweh’s wisdom as calling for all sinners to listen and obey. Jesus gives every person the wisdom to hear His call, to repent, and follow Him in faith. <u>Second</u>, unlike the adulterous woman who employed deceit leading to death, Solomon stated that Yahweh’s wisdom offers truth and righteousness. Jesus’ wisdom also guides your path in His truth, and He provides a path to transform you in His righteousness. <u>Third</u>, Solomon revealed that Yahweh’s wisdom is a gift more valuable than gold. It offers knowledge and discernment for those who fear Him by hating evil. Jesus’ wisdom also provides knowledge and discernment when you fear Him. <u>Fourth</u>, Solomon described Yahweh’s wisdom as loving those who seek and obey Him. Jesus’ wisdom also provides a pathway to His fellowship for those who seek Him and obey Him. <u>Fifth</u>, Solomon described Yahweh’s wisdom as having been present at the beginning of all creation. Jesus is eternal, and He offers to share His eternal knowledge through the Holy Spirit. <u>Sixth</u>, Solomon promised blessings for all who follow Yahweh’s wisdom. Jesus’ wisdom also provides the path to a blessed life when followed. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon promised life for those who accept Yahweh’s wisdom and death for those who reject it. Jesus’ wisdom also provides the path to salvation for all who have faith in Him.</p>

Prov. 8:1-5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is freely available to all who are willing to listen</u>. In contrast to the adulterous woman who employed deceit under darkness, Yahweh’s wisdom is open and available to all who will turn to Him. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Does not wisdom call, and understanding raise her voice? <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>On top of the heights beside the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand; <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>beside the gates, at the opening to the city, at the entrance of the doors, she cries out: <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>‘To you, people, I call, and my voice is to mankind. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You naive ones, understand prudence; and, you fools, understand wisdom!</em>” (Prov. 8:1-5). “The adulteress moves stealthily at dusk and speaks deceitfully; Wisdom moves publicly and speaks truthfully. The adulteress leads her victims to slavery and death; Wisdom leads her disciples to kingship, wealth, and life. The adulteress lives, moves, and has her being in the earthly, mundane sphere; Wisdom soars in heaven, above space and time. The uncommitted youth needs to make a decision to love Wisdom before he enters the danger-laden city … The adulteress pitches her pleasure, which ends in death. Wisdom demands discipline, which ends in life.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 8:1-5).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is not hidden or limited to those with special knowledge or training</u><em>.</em> To emphasize that none can claim a valid excuse for ignoring Yahweh’s wisdom, Solomon began the book of Proverbs with a similar description of Yahweh’s public cry: “Wisdom shouts in the street, she raises her voice in the public square; at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the gates in the city she declares her sayings:” (Prov. 1:20-21). The New Testament also makes clear that wisdom is available to all who pray in faith. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5). The wisdom leading to salvation through Jesus is also a free gift to all who believe. “being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,” (Ro. 3:24).</p></li>

<p>The wisdom of Jesus cries out to you when you read His Word and pray about it<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>True wisdom comes from Jesus</u>. Solomon also made clear that true wisdom comes from only Yahweh. “<em>For the LORD gives wisdom</em>; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “It is He who changes the times and the periods; He removes kings and appoints kings; <em>He gives wisdom to wise men, and knowledge to people of understanding</em>.” (Dan. 2:21). Jesus later revealed that the entire Old Testament is about Him (Lk. 24:44). Thus, true wisdom comes through Jesus. “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, <em>who became to us wisdom from God</em>, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). “<em>[I]n whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). His wisdom is a gift that comes when you have faith in Him. “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, <em>may give you a spirit of wisdom</em> and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.” (Eph. 1:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus, the personification of wisdom, calls upon everyone to repent</u>. Wisdom’s call in Proverbs 8 is connected to the sinner who embraced sin and rejected the fear of Yahweh in Proverbs 7. Wisdom cries out to all “<em>mankind</em>” and “<em>fools</em>” who have rejected the fear of Yahweh (Prov. 8:4-5). In response to wisdom’s call, believers are commanded to listen and obey. “A wise person will hear and increase in learning, and a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel,” (Prov. 1:5). “Make your ear attentive to wisdom; incline your heart to understanding. For if you cry out for insight, and raise your voice for understanding;” (Prov. 2:2-3). Jesus also began His ministry with His call to repentance. “From that time Jesus began to preach and say, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”’  (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus came “saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”’  (Mk. 1:15).  His disciples also began their ministry with a call to repentance:  “Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”’  (Acts 2:38).  If you confess your sins to Jesus, He alone will forgive all your sins: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 Jo. 1:9). </p></li>

Prov. 8:6-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom brings truth and righteousness</u>. Unlike the adulterous woman who spoke deceitfully, Yahweh’s wisdom reveals only truth and righteousness. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Listen, for I will speak noble things; and the opening of my lips will reveal right things. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>For my mouth will proclaim truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverted in them. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>They are all straightforward to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 8:6-9). “Wisdom’s doctrines, upon which her laws are founded, are such as we may venture our immortal souls upon: <em>My mouth shall speak truth (v.7)</em>, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, for it is a testimony to the world. Every word of God is true; there are not so much as pious frauds in it, nor are we imposed upon in that which is told us for our good. Christ is a faithful witness, is the truth itself;” (Matthew Henry, Prov. 8:6-8).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom reveals truth, His righteousness, and the path to eternal life</u>. Yahweh’s wisdom “<em>will proclaim truth</em>” and “<em>righteousness</em>” (Prov. 8:7-8). Jesus is the truth. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). “The sum of Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments is everlasting.” (Ps. 119:160). Faith in Jesus’ atoning sacrifice also transforms you with His righteousness. “but it is the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction,” (Ro. 3:22). Following His wisdom also brings eternal life. “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh provides no benefit; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and are life.” (Jo. 6:63). “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.” (Ro. 8:2). “It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Gal. 5:1). Thus, every person is called upon to both listen to and follow the truth of Jesus’ wisdom. “Incline your ear and come to Me. Listen, that you may live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, according to the faithful mercies shown to David.” (Is. 55:3).</p></li>

<p>The wisdom of Jesus offers you truth and transformation with His righteousness<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The fruit of Jesus’ wisdom should be visible in a believer’s walk</u>. When a believer walks in Jesus’ wisdom, the person should become pure, peaceful, gentle, merciful, honest, and be filled with integrity. “But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, free of hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.” (Jam. 3:17-18). “The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.” (Ps. 37:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom should not be confused with worldly wisdom</u>. Believers must be careful to only listen to Jesus’ wisdom. Like the adulteress in Proverbs 7, there are many false and demonic spirits teaching worldly wisdom. “A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none, nut knowledge is easy for one who has understanding.” (Prov. 14:6). “Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory;” (1 Cor. 2:6-7). “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.” (Jam. 3:13-15).</p></li>

Prov. 8:10-16.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom has greater value than any worldly treasure</u>. While the adulterous woman could only offer the man a false moment of pleasure, Solomon revealed that Yahweh’s wisdom is a gift greater than any worldly treasure: “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Accept my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For wisdom is better than jewels; and all desirable things cannot compare with her.</em> <em><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is to hate evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverted mouth, I hate. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Advice is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly</em>.” (Prov. 8:10-16). “[T]he doctrines of the Gospel are of more worth, and more to be desired, than thousands of gold and silver; and therefore the meaning is, that the instruction of wisdom should be received rather than silver; it should have the preference;” (John Gill on Prov. 8:10-11).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom should be your greatest treasure</u>. Solomon previously declared that those who seek Yahweh’s wisdom will be blessed for doing so “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her produce better than gold. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her. <strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.” (Prov. 3:13-16; see also, 2:4-5; 16:16). Job also revealed that God’s wisdom is greater than any worldly treasure (Job 28:15-19). Jesus is the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). “[I]n whom are hidden all the <em>treasures of wisdom</em> and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Jesus proclaimed that the Kingdom of Heaven, which includes His wisdom, is like a hidden treasure in a field that a wise person will do everything possible to acquire and protect: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44). Thus, all should seek after His wisdom.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ wisdom first, and He will provide for your other needs</u>. When Solomon became King, he prayed for Yahweh’s wisdom to lead Israel. Because he prayed correctly, Yahweh gave him both wisdom and wealth. “behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall one like you arise after you. I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days.” (1 Kgs. 3:12-13). When you seek first the wisdom that Jesus offers, He will also provide for your other needs. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom includes hating evil</u>. Solomon previously revealed that, “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge</em>; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). A psalmist made a similar revelation. “<em>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom</em>; all those who follow His commandments have a good understanding; His praise endures forever.” (Ps. 111:10). Here, Solomon defines what it means to fear Yahweh. “<em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is to hate evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverted mouth, I hate.</em>” (Prov. 8:13). This definition also matches a similar description found in the book of Job. “And to mankind He said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding.’” (Job 28:28). Jesus came to fulfill these verses by peaching righteousness and hating what He defines as evil in His Word. “The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, <em>the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD</em>.” (Is. 11:2). Believers must also hate what Jesus defines as evil in His Word. “<em>Hate evil, you who love the LORD</em>, who watches over the souls of His godly ones; He saves them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 97:10). “<em>Hate evil, love good</em>, and establish justice in the gate! Perhaps the LORD God of armies will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.” (Amos 5:15). “Love must be free of hypocrisy. <em>Detest what is evil; cling to what is good</em>.” (Ro. 12:9). “Evil, pride, arrogance, and an evil way are hateful to Him. If we belong to Him, we will hate these things also.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 8:13).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Fear Jesus by hating what He calls evil, and cling to what He calls good<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hating evil includes separation from unholy, carnal desires</u>. Unlike the man who gave into the temptations of adulterous women, believers should show their fear of the Lord with “prudence.” “<em>I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</em>” (Prov. 8:12). “Wisdom’s policy is never to keep company with carnal things. She always holds hands with holiness without any apology.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 8:12).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When you fear Jesus, He also offers His wisdom of discernment</u>. If you reject what is evil, Jesus also offers His wisdom of discernment: “<em>Advice is mine and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.</em>” (Prov. 8:14; 2:6). “Wisdom and might are with Him; advice and understanding belong to Him.” (Job 12:13). “Daniel said, ‘May the name of God be blessed forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.”’ (Dan. 2:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Rulers should fear Jesus by hating evil because He is the sovereign King of Kings</u>. In His wisdom, Jesus also decides who is allowed to rule, and He is the source of all justice on Earth. “<em><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly</em>.” (Prov. 8:15-16). “It is He who changes the times and the periods; He removes kings and appoints kings; He gives wisdom to wise men, and knowledge to people of understanding.” (Dan. 2:21). “It is He who reduces rulers to nothing, who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.” (Is. 40:23). “Every person is to be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.” (Ro. 13:1). Thus, every ruler should fear Jesus by hating what He calls evil and pray for His wisdom, discernment, and justice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <u>Jesus’ Fellowship: Jesus’ Wisdom Provides A Pathway to His Fellowship For Those Who Seek Him and Obey Him</u>. Prov. 8:17-21.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reward you with loving fellowship when you seek His wisdom</u>. If you diligently seek Yahweh’s wisdom, He will also bless you with His fellowship. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>I love those who love me; and those who diligently seek me will find me. <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold; and my yield better than choice silver. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice, <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>to endow those who love me with wealth, that I may fill their treasuries</em>.” (Prov. 8:17-21). “Those who <strong>love</strong> and pursue wisdom will find themselves rewarded. They will find wisdom (<strong>those who seek me diligently will find me</strong>) and the blessings wisdom brings (<strong>riches and honor… righteousness</strong>). It could even be said that wisdom seeks out her followers to bless them (<strong>that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth</strong>).” (David Guzik on Prov. 7:17) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ wisdom with all your heart and soul</u>. Yahweh declares, “<em>I love those who love me; and those who diligently seek me will find me.</em>” (Prov. 7:17). As our example, David declared: “When You said, ‘Seek My face,’ my heart said to You, ‘I shall seek Your face, LORD.”’ (Ps. 27:8). If you search after Jesus, you will find Him. “And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13). “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8). When you search out His wisdom, He will bless you with His loving fellowship. “Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.” (Rev. 3:20). His offer of fellowship should be treated as a gift that is greater than any Earthly treasure (Prov. 7:18-19). “Wisdom loves her lovers and seeks her seekers. He is already wise who seeks to be wise, and he has almost found wisdom who diligently seeks her. What is true of wisdom in general is especially true of wisdom embodied in our Lord Jesus. Him we are to love and to seek, and in return we shall enjoy His love and find Himself.” (Charles Spurgeon on Prov. 8:17).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus can guide you on the path of righteousness</u>. With Jesus’ wisdom, you can also “<em>walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice,</em>” (Prov. 8:20). “He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.” (Ps. 23:3). “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). “I will lead those who are blind by a way they have not known, in paths they have not known I will guide them. I will turn darkness into light before them and uneven land into plains. These are the things I will do, and I will not leave them undone.” (Is. 42:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Continually seek out Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Jesus also wants you to continually seek out His wisdom as your greatest treasure: “Seek the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.” (1 Chr. 16:11). “Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.” (Ps. 51:6). “Seek the LORD so that you may live, . . .” (Amos 5:6a). “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for the one who comes to God must believe that He exists, and that <em>He proves to be One who rewards those who seek Him</em>.” (Heb. 11:6). Are you continually seeking His wisdom?</p></li>

Prov. 8:22-31.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is eternal</u>. Jesus created all things, and He paid the price for His divine wisdom to be shared with you through His Word, prayer, and the Holy Spirit. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> created me at the beginning of His way, before His works  of old. <strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>From eternity I was established, from the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth. <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>When there were no ocean depths, I was born, when there were no springs abounding with water. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was born; “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>while He had not yet made the earth and the fields, nor the first dust of the world. <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep, <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>when He made firm the skies above, when the springs of the deep became fixed, <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>when He set a boundary for the sea so that the water would not violate His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth; <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>then I was beside Him, as a master workman; and I was His delight daily, rejoicing always before Him</em>, <strong><sup>31</sup></strong> <em>rejoicing in the world, His earth, and having my delight in the sons of mankind.</em>” (Prov. 8:22-31). “Wisdom speaks of her origin, her active operations, the part which she bore in the creation of the universe, her relation to God …The language used is not applicable to an impersonal quality, an abstract faculty of God. It describes the nature and office of a Person; and who that Person is we learn from the later Scriptures, which speak of Christ as the ‘Wisdom of God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm"><u>Luke 11:49</u></a>) and ‘the Power of God and the Wisdom of God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm"><u>1 Corinthians 1:24</u></a>) … There is, then, nothing forced or incongruous in seeing in this episode a portraiture of the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, the essential Wisdom of God personified, the Logos of later books, and of the gospel. This interpretation obtained universally in the Church in the earliest times, and has commended itself to the most learned and reverent of modern commentators.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 8:22-31).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Council of Nicaea debate about Proverbs 8</u>. In 325 AD in Iznik, Turkey, bishops from around the Roman Empire gathered to settle several disputes that threatened to divide the early Church. The disputes centered around a debate about Jesus’ identity in relation to God the Father. Proverbs 8 formed an important part of this dispute. The philosopher Arius (256-336 AD) relied upon Proverbs 8:22 (“<strong><sup>22</sup></strong> The <em><span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em> created me at the beginning of His way, before His works of old.”) and Colossians 1:15 to teach the ancient heresy of “Arianism”. He taught that Jesus was not coeternal with God the Father.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> At the Council of Nicaea, the bishops debated and agreed that the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are co-equal. They then agreed upon the doctrine of the Trinity. For several reasons, the belief that Jesus is not co-equal with the Father (a belief shared today by Jehovah Witnesses) is a heresy. <em>First</em>, multiple other verses make clear that Jesus is eternal, and He created all things (Heb. 1:1-2; 13:8; Jo. 1:1-4, 10; 8:58; Rev. 1:8; 3:14). Indeed, in Proverbs 8:22, the phrase “in the beginning” (<span dir="rtl">רֵאשִׁ֣ית</span> (rê·šîṯ)) repeats the first Hebrew phase in the Bible (Gen. 1:1).<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This emphasizes that wisdom incarnate -- Jesus Christ (John 1:1-3, 14) authored all creation. <em>Second</em>, Jesus is Yahweh, who shares wisdom. The word “LORD” is the English interpretation of Yahweh. This is another name for the great “I AM.” Jesus is the great I AM “Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was born, <em>I am</em>.”’ (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). Thus, the wisdom referenced Proverbs 8 came from Jesus. <em>Third</em>, Arius made the mistake of relying upon the Greek Septuagint translation of the original Hebrew text instead of the Hebrew text itself. Solomon’s choose Hebrew words that make clear that Jesus summoned the wisdom from within Himself instead of creating something from nothing. The words in English “created me” come from the Hebrew word “qā·nā·nî” (<span dir="rtl">קָ֭נָנִי</span>). This word appears 85 times in the Bible. In none of the usages of this word is something created from nothing. It more commonly means “to procure, by purchase, to own” and then bring the item forth. As one example, “the field which Abraham purchased (“qā·nā·nî” (<span dir="rtl">קָ֭נָנִי</span>)) from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.” (Gen. 25:10; see also Gen. 33:19; 47:19-20; 49:30; 50:13; Ex. 15:16; 21:2; Lev. 22:11; 25:14-15, 28, 30, 44, 45, 50; 27:24; Dt. 28:68; 32:6; Josh. 24:32; Ruth 4:4-5, 8-10; 2 Sam. 12:3; 24:21).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Jesus paid the price at the cross to share His wisdom leading to salvation (Jo. 3:16; 1 Pet. 2:22-25). His wisdom is a free gift for all with faith. <em>Fourth,</em> if Solomon wanted to convey that wisdom was created from nothing, he would have used the Hebrew word “bā·rā” (<span dir="rtl">בָּרָ֣א</span>) as that term appears in Genesis 1:1.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The wisest man on Earth before Jesus selected his words with precision. <em>Fifth</em>, if Yahweh were to be considered God the Father and if He “created” wisdom for the first time with Jesus as this false doctrine teaches, then God the Father did not have access to true wisdom before Jesus. It allegedly came into being with Jesus. But this would be an absurd interpretation. <em>Sixth</em>, wisdom in this story becomes the “representation” of Jesus the same way His printed Word in the Bible “represents” the eternal Word that became flesh (Jo. 1:1, 14). This is made clear in the same chapter of Proverbs: “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.” (Prov. 8:12). There is not a separate divine being called “prudence” who is dwelling with Jesus. <em>Finally</em>, although Church leaders can make mistakes, this has been the united view of the Church since the first Council of Nicaea resolved this exact issue in 325 AD. Among the great Church fathers to resolve the issue, the Greek philosopher Justin Marty (circa 100-165 A.D.) taught that the wisdom personified in Proverbs 8 referred to Jesus Christ. But a minority view came from the Greek Bishop Irenaeus of Lyon (circa 130 – 202 A.D.). He believed that these verses instead referenced the Holy Spirit.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> He pointed out that the Holy Spirit created with Jesus (Gen. 1:2). But the Triune God works together as one. Jesus shares His glory and wisdom through the Holy Spirit “He will glorify Me, for He will take from Mine and will disclose it to you.” (Jo. 16:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is preeminent over all creation</u>. In Colossians 1:15, Jesus is called “the firstborn of all creation.” But this does not mean that Jesus was the first to be “born” as Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons believe. Instead, “firstborn” means “preeminent one.”<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> In Exodus, Yahweh referred to Israel as His “firstborn”. “Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: “<em>Israel is My son, My firstborn</em>.”’ (Ex. 4:22). God did not give “birth” to Israel. Instead, like Jesus, it had a preeminent honor. Thus, these verses are all meant to stress Jesus’ preeminent role is bringing forth His wisdom for mankind.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Modern objections to Jesus’ depiction in Proverbs 8 are equally meritless</u>. Today, some try to resolve the ancient debate by alleging that Proverbs 8 refers to a spirit called “Lady Wisdom”.<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Others object to connecting these verses to Jesus because of the female gender that is used. “but the <em>woman</em> of Proverbs 8 does not directly describe Jesus.” (David Guzik on Prov. 8) (italics in original).<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> This objection is based upon the fact that wisdom is referred to by the female gender “she” and “her” (e.g., Prov. 1:20-21; 8:2). But Solomon’s reference to wisdom by the female gender is a unique construct of Hebrew grammar. In Hebrew, wisdom or “chokhmah” (<span dir="rtl">חָכְמָה</span>) is grammatically feminine.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> The female nature of the word also underscores the desirability of God’s wisdom. “She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her.” (Prov. 3:15). In Proverbs 8, wisdom is called a “master workman;” (Prov. 8:30). Thus, Jesus is a man. The early Church fathers all understood this and agreed that either Jesus or the Holy Spirit is referenced in these verses. Other commentators suggest that Proverbs 8 should merely be treated as Hebrew poetry. While Hebrew poetry is used, it would be a mistake to end the analysis there. If the only message to be drawn from Proverbs 8 is that it is poetry, then it holds no value in guiding a person’s life choices.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because Jesus’ wisdom is eternal and created all things, His wisdom is trustworthy</u>. Jesus’ wisdom can be trusted because He used it to create the universe and all that is within it. “<em>The LORD founded the earth by wisdom</em>, He established the heavens by understanding.” (Prov. 3:19). “It is He who made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom; and by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.” (Jer. 12:10). “LORD, how many are Your works! <em>In wisdom You have made them all; the earth is full of Your possessions</em>.” (Ps. 104:24). “for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Col. 1:16). “All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.” (Jo. 1:3). “in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the world.” (Heb. 1:2). “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” (Rev. 4:11). Thus, you can trust Jesus’ wisdom.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>If followed, Jesus’ wisdom reveals the secrets to a blessed life</u>. The adulterous woman could offer only short-term pleasure followed by pain. In contrast, Yahweh offers to pour out His blessings on believers who live with faith-led obedience in seeking His wisdom. “<em><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>‘Now then, sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways. <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>Listen to instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Blessed is the person who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts</em>.” (Prov. 8:32-34). “Blessed is the man that heareth me, ... Christ in his Gospel, as speaking by his ministers; for hearing them is hearing him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-16.htm"><u>Luke 10:16</u></a>; they have their commission from him; are his ambassadors, and represent him; receive their gifts from him; speak according to his mind and will, revealed in his word, and preach him himself. This shows with what attention and reverence the Gospel should be heard; what credit should be given unto it; how it ought to be put in practice; …;” (John Gill’s Commentary on Prov. 8:34).<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>To be wise and be blessed, you must faithfully obey Jesus’ wisdom and instruction</u>. Solomon stated that believers are “<em>blessed</em>” when they “<em>keep my ways.</em>” (Prov. 8:32). Jesus also said, “… blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it.” (Lk. 11:28). Those who follow Jesus’ wisdom will be blessed. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:24-27). “But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not just hearers who deceive themselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. But one who has looked intently at the perfect law, the law of freedom, and has continued in it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an active doer, this person will be blessed in what he does.” (Jam. 1:22-25). To be blessed in life, obedience should be the fruit of your faith in Jesus.</p></li>
<li><p><u>21 specific blessings in the Torah for those who are faithful and obedient to God</u>.  In the four books of the Law, God reveals at least 21 additional specific blessings for those who are faithful and obedient to Him.  These blessings are unrelated to Jesus’ blessings of eternal salvation. In Exodus, God revealed at least three conditional blessings that come from faithful obedience.  These include: (1) protection from diseases (Ex. 15:26); a prolonged life (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16; 5:32-33; 4:40; 6:1-2; 12:28; 22:6-7; 25:13-16; Lev. 18:5; Eph. 6:2-3); and (3) God’s holy presence (Ex. 40:34-35).  In Leviticus, God revealed seven other conditional blessings that He may use to bless a person or a nation for obedience. These include: (1) provision (Lev. 26:3-5); (2) peace (Lev. 26:6); (3) protection (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22); (4) fertility (Lev. 26:9); (5) abundance from giving (Lev. 26:10; Ps. 92:12-14; Mal. 3:10-12); (6) guidance (Lev. 26: 11-12; Ps. 32:8); and (7) freedom  (Lev. 26:13; Ex. 20:2).  In Deuteronomy, He revealed 10 other conditional blessings. These include:  (1) exaltation for the nation (Dt. 28:1-2); (2) exaltation for the individual within the nation (Dt. 28:1-3); (3) growth (Dt. 28:4); (4) food (Dt. 28:5); (5) success (Dt. 28:6); (6) the defeat of your enemies (D. 28:7); (7) prosperity (Dt. 28:8); (8) holiness (Dt. 28:9); (9) respect (Dt. 28:10); and (10) the fullness of God’s blessings (Dt. 28:11-14).  Finally, in books of the Law from Exodus through Deuteronomy, God reveals the blessing of forgiveness from the blood sacrifices (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). Jesus became the final one-time sacrifice to fulfill the Old Testament sacrificial laws (Heb. 10:12). The only act of obedience required to receive this blessing today is to believe that He died for your sins and that He is both your Lord and Savior  (Ro. 10:13; Acts 2:21; Jo. 3:16; 1 Jo. 1:9).  If you follow Jesus’ wisdom, He offers you these blessings.</p></li>

Prov. 8:35-36.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom offers the path to eternal life for those with faith</u>. Finally, Solomon observed that while the adulterous woman offered a path leading to death, Yahweh’s wisdom offers life. “<strong><sup>35 </sup></strong><em>For one who finds me finds life, and obtains favor from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>But one who sins against me injures himself; all those who hate me love death</em>.” (Prov. 8:35-36). “The wisdom here intended, when attained, is the life, salvation, and happiness of men. Christ, the Wisdom and Word of God incarnate, to whom all these attributes agree perfectly, is peculiarly so. But he must be found; that is, known, believed in, loved, and obeyed; he must be revealed to and in us.” (Albert Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 8:32-35).<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> “Christ is Wisdom, and he is Life to all believers; nor can we obtain God’s favor, unless we find Christ, and are found in him. Those who offend Christ deceive themselves; sin is a wrong to the soul. Sinners die because they will die, which justifies God when he judges.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 8:32-36).<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers the path to eternal salvation</u>. Jesus promised “<em>For one who finds me finds life,</em>…” (Prov. 8:35). In the Old Testament, many Jews understood that their souls went to a place called (<span dir="rtl">שְׁאוֹל</span>) “<em>Sheol</em>” upon death (e.g., Prov. 1:12; Pss. 16:10; 18:5; 49:14, 88:3; 116:3; 139:8; 2 Sam. 22:6; Hos. 13:14; 5:5; 7:27; 15:11; 27:20; Job 26:6; Is. 14:11, 15; 38:18; Ezek. 31:17).  But the psalmists had faith that God would redeem the souls of those made righteous through their faith.  “For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Ps. 16:10). “But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For Your graciousness toward me is great, and You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.” (Ps. 88:13). “For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.” (Ps. 116:8). “I will not die, but live, and tell of the works of the LORD.” (Ps. 118:17). God also promised that He would “ransom” souls from <em>Sheol</em> (Hos. 13:14).  He further promised that a miraculous resurrection would take place.  “Your dead will live; their corpses will rise.  You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, for your dew is as the dew of the dawn, and the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.” (Is. 26:19; Ezek. 37:12-14).  Jesus came to fulfill these prophecies. Through faith in Him, you can live forever with Him in heaven “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16). “By this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him.” (1 Jo. 4:9). He further offers abundant life with Him in heaven. “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.” (Jo. 10:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the only path to heaven</u>. Every person should follow Jesus’ wisdom because He offers the only path to heaven. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.”’ (Jo. 14:6). Solomon makes clear that there are two paths: one leading to life and the other leading to death (Prov. 2:21-22).  Jesus further reveals that the path leading to life is a narrow one.  “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.  For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.”  (Matt. 7:13-14: Jo. 10:9).  The fear of the LORD should prompt everyone to pray for His wisdom to stay on His narrow path.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who reject Jesus’ face death</u>. Solomon warned, “<em><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>But one who sins against me injures himself; all those who hate me love death</em>.” (Prov. 8:36). Those who reject the free gift of salvation that Jesus offers face His wrath “… [T]he one who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” (Jo. 3:36). “… [T]he one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 Jo. 5:12). Thus, the wise will cling to the narrow path that Jesus offers leading to salvation.</p></li>
