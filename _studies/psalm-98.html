<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 98 does not list its author. The Greek Septuagint calls it “A Psalm of David.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> But many commentators believe that this psalm corresponds with the God’s deliverance of the Jews from Babylonian captivity between 538-539 B.C.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Whatever its original context, it likely foreshadows Jesus’ end times deliverance: “The eschatological emphasis is present in all the so-called enthronement psalms; but here (and in Psalm 96) with the grand announcement that the LORD is coming to judge the world, is strikingly clear. When He does come to make everything right, all the people of the earth and all of nature will respond in ways that will reflect His majesty.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 98).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> God’s deliverance of the Jews also foreshadows the blessings that Jesus offers all believers. These include: (1) new beginnings, (2) deliverance, (3) His guiding light, (4), faithfulness, (5) salvation, (6) joy, and (7) righteousness.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist urged the Jews to “<em>sing a new song to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em><span class="smallcaps">”</span> regarding His “<em>wonderful</em>” works. God’s wonderful works included resurrecting the dead state of Israel as a new creation. Jesus also did a “wonderful” at the cross. Through faith, He offers a path for all to become new creations with eternal life. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist praised the power of God’s “<em>holy arm</em>” to deliver Israel. Through faith, Jesus also offers to deliver you from bondage and eternal death. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist praised God for making “<em>salvation known</em>” to “<em>the nations</em>.” This foreshadows the promise of salvation that Jesus offers to everyone. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist praised God because He is faithful to keep His promises. You can also praise Jesus because He is faithful to fulfill every promise in the Bible. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist thanked God because all the nations have “<em>seen the salvation of our God</em>.” Through His disciples, Jesus’ offer of salvation will also be made known throughout the world. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist stated that God’s promised Messiah will bring joy to all creation. Jesus is the Messiah and King of Kings who will bring joy to all creation. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist promised that the Messiah will also judge the nations with righteousness. As the King of Kings, Jesus will one day judge with justice and righteousness.</p>
<h2 id="new-beginnings-praise-jesus-for-making-you-a-new-creation.-ps.-981a."><strong>1. <u>New Beginnings: Praise Jesus for Making You a New Creation</u>. Ps. 98:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has done a wonderous thing by making His believers new creations</u>. God took the dead state of Israel, and He transformed it into a reborn nation. Possibly for this reason, the psalmist urged the Jews to sing a “new song” of praise for God’s work of redemption: “<strong><sup>1a</sup></strong> <em>Sing a new song to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He has done wonderful things,</em>” (Ps. 98:1a). Through Jesus, this psalm also carries an equally profound meaning for the end times. “The coming of Yahweh will result in nothing less than the world’s salvation, the making of all things new, the wiping away of every tear, the joy of the whole earth. Thus Ps. 97 is followed by Ps 98, and in 98:1 the command to sing to Yahweh a <em>new</em> song, perhaps in contrast to the <em>old</em> song of Moses (Exod 15). This new song is necessary because Yahweh has done new wonders, because just as at the exodus he brought His people out with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, here again in 98:1b His right hand and holy arm have achieved salvation for Him.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 98:1) (italics original).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God promised that He would cleanse Israel, and He would recreate it with a “new heart”</u> . To encourage the Jews during their captivity, Jeremiah promised the Jews that God would recreate Israel: “For behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The LORD says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take possession of it.’” (Jer. 30:3). Ezekiel also promised that God would recreate Israel. But God would also transform Israel and give it a “new heart,” a foreshadow of the Holy Spirit: “For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the lands; and I will bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, <em>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you</em>; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in My statutes, and are careful and follow My ordinances.” (Ezek. 36:24-26). God’s promise of a “new heart” merited a “new song” of praise from Israel.</p></li>

<p>Sing Jesus’ praise for transforming you and for making you a new creation<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has also blessed His believers by making them “new creations”</u>.  “The work of our redemption and salvation by Christ is a work of wonder. If we take a view of all the steps of it, from the contrivance of it before all time to the consummation of it, and its everlasting consequences when time shall be no more, we shall say, God has in it done marvelous things; it is all his doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.” (Benson Commentary on Ps. 98:1).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you can also give thanks that He has made a new creation out of you:  “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a <em>new creature</em>; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.”  (2 Cor. 5:17).  “Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.”  (Ro. 6:4).  But you must actively work to make sure that you do not corrupt the new creation that Jesus has created:  “and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.”  (Eph. 4:24).  Are you praising Jesus for His wondrous new work in you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>As a “new creation” sing a “new song” to praise Jesus</u>.  This psalm urges believers to “Sing a <em>new song</em> to the LORD . . .”  (Ps. 98:1a).  Similar wording appears throughout the Bible:  “Sing to Him a <em>new song</em>; play skillfully with a shout of joy.”  (Ps. 33:3).  “He put a<em> new song</em> in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; many will see and fear and will trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Ps.  40:3). “<em>Sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> a new song;</em>”  (Ps. 96:1).  “I will sing a <em>new song</em> to You, O God; . . .”<em> </em> (Ps. 144:9). “Praise the LORD!  Sing <em>a new song</em> to the LORD, <em>and</em> His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.”  (Ps. 149:1).  “Sing to the LORD a <em>new song</em>,  . . .”  (Is. 42:10).  “And they sang a <em>new song</em>, . . .”  (Rev. 5:9a). “And they sang a <em>new song</em> before the throne . . .” (Rev. 14:3). If you are a new creation, you should be filled with new joy and gratitude.</p></li>

<h2 id="deliverance-praise-jesus-for-delivering-you-from-eternal-death.-ps.-981b."><strong>2. <u>Deliverance: Praise Jesus for Delivering You from Eternal Death</u>. Ps. 98:1b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wondrous works include His deliverance</u>. The psalmist praised God for delivering the Jews from captivity: “<strong><sup>1b</sup></strong> <em>His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him</em>.” (Ps. 98:1b). God’s deliverance of the Jews also foreshadowed Jesus’ deliverance of His people: “So Christ fought our battle with his right hand; he did it with ease, with strength, and with infinite wisdom.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 98).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God delivered Israel with His mighty arm</u>. The psalmist praised the mighty power of God’s “<em>holy arm</em>.” (Ps. 98:1). God’s outstretched arm delivered the Jews from their first time of bondage in Egypt: “Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the labors of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their bondage. <em>I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm</em>, and with great judgments.”’ (Ex. 6:6). Isaiah later promised that God would again use His mighty arm to deliver Israel. “<em>The LORD has bared His holy arm</em> in the sight of all the nations, so that all the ends of the earth may see the salvation of our God.” (Is. 52:10). His outstretched arm remains ready to deliver you in your time of need: “With a strong hand and an <em>outstretched arm</em>, for His faithfulness is everlasting.” (Ps. 136:12).</p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus for freeing you from bondage to sin<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus as your deliverer</u>.  Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would bring good news and deliver God’s people: “The Spirit of the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> is upon me, because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> anointed me to bring <em>good news</em> to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, <em>to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners</em>;” (Is. 61:1). Jesus quoted from this prophesy to reveal that it referred to Him (Lk. 4:17-18; Matt. 11:4-5). David also prophesied that the Messiah who would free the oppressed: “You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.’” (Ps. 2:9). The New Testament confirms that David was referring to Jesus: “And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are shattered, as I also have received authority from My Father;” (Rev. 2:27). Jesus will one day come to judge evil: “Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;” (2 Thess. 2:8). “From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.” (Rev. 19:15). Jesus again deserves your praise for delivering you from evil.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His protection</u>.  Jesus is also your rock.  He also deserves your praise for His protection from your enemies:  “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,”  (2 Sam. 22:47).  “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my savior, You save me from violence.”  (2 Sam. 22:3).  “The Rock!  His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He.” (Dt. 32:4).  “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2, 31, 46; 19:14).  Do you praise Jesus for His protection in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>All things are possible with God when you have faith</u>. When you have faith, there is no miracle that is too big for God: “Is anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14(a)). “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” (Jer. 32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). “‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26(b); Mk. 10:27(b); Lk. 1:37). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). Thus, you can trust God.</p></li>

<h2 id="his-guiding-light-praise-jesus-for-offering-his-holy-light.-ps.-982."><strong>3. <u>His Guiding Light: Praise Jesus For Offering His Holy Light</u>. Ps. 98:2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the light of the world and a beacon of hope and salvation</u>. The psalmist further praised God for making His path of salvation known to the nations: “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has made His salvation known; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations</em>.” (Ps. 98:2). “I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; and My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, and My glory for Israel.” (Is. 46:13). This also foreshadows the light of salvation that Jesus offers all nations: “The <em>marvelous things</em> of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+98.1&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 98:1</a> have been published <strong>in the sight of the nations</strong>. · This is evident because of the public nature of God’s unfolding work of redemption. · This is a prophecy of a coming day when all the earth will hear. · This is an exhortation to God’s people to proclaim the message of His <strong>salvation</strong> and <strong>righteousness</strong> . . . The New Testament shows that God <strong>made known His salvation</strong> in a way beyond the psalmist’s expectation. The Person and Work of Jesus Christ and the worldwide spread of the Gospel are fulfillments of this.” (David Guzik on Ps. 98:2) (emphasis original).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the Light of the world</u>. Jesus is a Light offering a path of salvation to all the nations: “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘<em>I am the Light of the world</em>; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). But many cannot comprehend His light because they love evil: “And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light; for their deeds were evil.” (Jo. 3:19).  “in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that <em>they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ</em>, who is the image of God.”  (2 Cor. 4:4). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ Word can also guide your path</u>. Jesus is also the Word that became flesh: “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (Jo. 1:14). Thus, His Word can guide you when you read it and pray for the Holy Spirit to apply it to your life: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). Are you regularly reading the Word and praying for the Holy Spirit to apply it to your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants His peoples to reflect His Light</u>. God also meant for the Jews to be His beacon of His light to the gentile nations: “I am the LORD, I have called You in righteousness, . . . I will appoint You as a covenant to the people, <em>as a light to the nations</em>,” (Is. 42:6). “He says, ‘It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel; <em>I will also make You a light of the nations</em> so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”’ (Is. 49:6; Acts 13:47). Today, any believer is meant to reflect Jesus’ Light (Matt. 5:14). Do non-believers see the Light of Jesus in your walk and how you treat others?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for making His light known to all the nations</u>. Because Jesus died to make His Light of salvation available to all the nations, He is worthy of your praise: “Let us praise him for the discoveries made to the world of the work of redemption; his salvation and his righteousness fulfilling the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament. In pursuance of this design, God raised up his Son Jesus to be not only a Light to lighten the Gentiles, but the glory of his people Israel.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 98:2).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> “The Lord is to be praised not only for effecting human salvation, but also for making it known, for man would never have discovered it for himself.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 98).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faithfulness-praise-jesus-because-he-is-faithful-to-his-promises.-ps.-983a."><strong>4. <u>Faithfulness: Praise Jesus Because He is Faithful to His Promises</u>. Ps. 98:3a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is faithful to keep His promises</u>. The psalmist praised God for His faithfulness in restoring Israel from its captivity: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>He has remembered His graciousness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;</em>” (Ps. 98:3a). Upon hearing the news that Mary was chosen to carry Jesus, she appears to have in part referenced this verse: “He has given help to His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy, just as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his descendants forever.” (Luke 1:54-55). “The idea is, that God had called to mind His promise of mercy to His people; that He had not suffered it to pass out of His recollection; that He had kept his word.” (Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Ps. 98:3).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to keep His promise to bless all the nations with the path to salvation</u>. God promised Abraham that He would bless through him all the nations of the Earth: “And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.” (Gen. 12:3; Acts 3:25). Jesus came to fulfill this promise: “The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘all the nations will be blessed in You.”’ (Gal. 3:8). All that is required is faith in Him as Lord and Savior (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ faithfulness is based upon love, mercy and grace</u>. The three major Bible translations differ on the correct translation of the Hebrew word “<span dir="rtl">חַסְדּ֨ו</span>ֹ ׀ (ḥas·dōw)”. In the NIV, it is translated as “love”: “He has remembered his <em>love</em> and his faithfulness to Israel; . . .” (Ps. 98:3a). In the NKJ, it is translated as “mercy”: “He has remembered His <em>mercy</em> and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; . . .” (Ps. 98:3a) (NKJ). In the NASB, it is translated as “graciousness”: “He has remembered His <em>graciousness</em> and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;” (Ps. 98:3a). When it comes to understanding the reasons for Jesus’ faithfulness, all three translations are helpful. He is faithful because He is filled with amazing love, mercy, and grace for His undeserving peoples.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for His faithfulness</u>. Throughout the Bible, God is praised for His faithfulness: “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His <em>faithfulness</em> to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His <em>faithfulness</em> to a thousand generations for those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “Your mercy, LORD, extends to the heavens, Your <em>faithfulness</em> reaches to the skies.” (Ps. 36:5). “But as for me, I will sing of Your strength; Yes, I will joyfully sing of Your <em>faithfulness</em> in the morning, for You have been my refuge and a place of refuge on the day of my distress.” (Ps. 59:16). “Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; for His <em>faithfulness</em> is everlasting.” (1 Chr. 16:34). “<em>Faithful</em> is He who calls you, and He also will do it.” (1 Thess. 5:24). “But the Lord is <em>faithful</em>, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.” (2 Thess. 3:3). Thus, you can trust Jesus’ promises to you. In your prayers and your worship, are you praising Jesus for His faithfulness?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks that Jesus’ faithfulness is not dependent on your faithfulness</u>. Even when the Jews rebelled, God remained faithful to His promise to never forsake them: “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you.” (Dt. 31:6; 4:31; Heb. 13:5; Neh. 9:18-19). You can also give thanks that His faithfulness is not conditioned upon our faithfulness: “If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you thanked God that He will not use your sins to revoke His promises?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="salvation-praise-jesus-for-his-offer-of-salvation.-ps.-983b."><strong>5. <u>Salvation: Praise Jesus for His Offer of Salvation</u>. Ps. 98:3b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers salvation to all the nations</u>. The psalmist also praised God because all the nations had seen God’s power of salvation through His deliverance of His peoples: “<em>all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God</em>.” (Ps. 98:3b). God wanted His deliverance of the Jews to draw all the gentile nations to Him: “The LORD has bared His holy arm in the sight of all the nations, <em>so that all the ends of the earth may see the salvation of our God</em>.” (Is. 52:10). “The union of mercy and truth (Ps 57:3; 85:10) secure the blessings of the promise (Gen 12:3; 18:18) to all the world (Isa 52:10).” (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on Ps. 98:3).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith in God makes possible your eternal salvation</u>. David repeatedly thanked God for his salvation: “For <em>You will not abandon my soul to Sheol</em>; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay. You will make known to me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures <em>forever</em>.” (Ps. 16:10-11). “<em>To rescue their soul from death</em> and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.” (Ps. 33:19-20). “But <em>God will redeem my soul</em> from the power of Sheol, for He will receive me. Selah” (Ps. 49:15). “For <em>You have saved my soul from death</em>, indeed my feet from stumbling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living.” (Ps. 56:13). “God is to us a <em>God of salvation</em>; and to GOD the Lord belong ways of escape from death.” (Ps. 68:20). “Help us, <em>God of our salvation</em>, for the glory of Your name; and save us and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.” (Ps. 79:9). “<em>You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol</em>.” (Ps. 86:13). God previously promised: “<em><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>I will … show him My salvation</em>.’” (Ps. 91:16). This psalm encourages you to “<em>proclaim the good news of His salvation.</em>” (Ps. 96:2). Through Jesus, this offer also extends to you and all the nations of the Earth.</p></li>

<p>Jesus offers salvation to all the nations<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Salvation is possible through Jesus’ atoning death on the cross</u>. Salvation was a mystery in Old Testament times (E.g., Ps. 6:5; Is. 38:18). But you can rely upon Jesus’ eternal promises of salvation: “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;” (Ro. 10:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give thanks for your salvation</u>. The psalms remind believers to give thanks for all God’s blessings: “But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; <em>my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation</em>.” (Ps. 13:5). “That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving and declare all Your wonders.” (Ps. 26:7). “God, You have taught me from my youth, and I still declare Your wondrous deeds.” (Ps. 71:17). “A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks to You, God, we give thanks, for Your name is near; people declare Your wondrous works.” (Ps. 75:1). “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>I will give thanks to You, Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name forever.” (Ps. 86:12). Jesus also deserves your praise. You can also show your gratitude by making your life a living sacrifice to Him (Ro. 12:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Help to make Jesus’ salvation known to all the nations</u>. Today, Jesus calls upon all believers to spread His offer of salvation to all the nations (Matt. 28:16-20). Are you helping to spread the Good News or paying to help missionaries do this?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="joy-praise-jesus-for-the-joy-he-offers-as-messiah-and-king.-ps.-984-8."><strong>6. <u>Joy: Praise Jesus for the Joy He Offers as Messiah and King</u>. Ps. 98:4-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ offer of salvation also brings joy</u>. The psalmist stated that all creation will one day respond with joy upon the arrival of God’s promised Messiah, the King of Kings: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Shout joyfully to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, all the earth; be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>With trumpets and the sound of the horn shout joyfully before the King, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>. <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>May the sea roar and all it contains, the world and those who dwell in it. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>May the rivers clap their hands, may the mountains sing together for joy</em>.” (Ps. 98:4-8). “God is to be praised heartily - with a loud and ringing voice. The body is to unite with the soul in giving him thanks, and to perform its part vigorously and with zeal (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-1.htm">Psalm 66:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-1.htm">Psalm 81:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-1.htm">Psalm 95:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-1.htm">Psalm 100:1</a>, etc.). And in the praise of God <strong>the whole earth</strong> is to join.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 98:4).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>All creation will praise the restoration offered through the Messiah</u>. The psalmist described a joy across all creation upon the Messiah’s return (Ps. 98:7-8). Jesus stated that if His disciples had not celebrated His arrival in Jerusalem, the stones would have done so. “Jesus replied, ‘I tell you, if these stop speaking, the stones will cry out!”’ (Lk. 19:40). All “creation groans and suffers” because of mankind’s original sin (Ro. 8:22). But Jesus will one day open the scroll to regain title to the Earth (Rev. 5:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is worthy of your joyful praise</u>. Jesus’ return should cause all to shout with praise: “But <em>rejoice</em>, all who take refuge in You, <em>sing for joy forever</em>! And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may <em>rejoice</em> in You.”  (Ps. 5:11). “<em>I will rejoice and be jubilant in You</em>; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.”  (Ps. 9:2).  “But the righteous will <em>be joyful</em>; they <em>will rejoice before God</em>; yes, they will <em>rejoice with gladness</em>.” (Ps. 68:3). “<em>Be joyful</em> in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise the mention of His holy name.” (Ps. 97:12). “<em>I will rejoice and be jubilant in You</em>; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” (Ps. 9:2). “Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.” (Ps. 66:2). “<em>I will also praise You</em> with a harp, and Your truth, my God; I will sing praises to You with the lyre, Holy One of Israel. <em>My lips will shout for joy</em> when I sing praises to You; and my soul, which You have redeemed.”  (Ps. 71:22-23).  “<em>Sing for joy to God</em> our strength; <em>shout joyfully</em> to the God of Jacob.” (Ps. 81:1). “It is good to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to Your name, Most High;” (Ps. 92:1). “<em>I rejoice at Your word</em>, like one who finds great plunder.”  (Ps. 119:162). “<em>Praise the LORD</em>! For it is good to <em>sing praises</em> to our God; for it is pleasant and <em>praise is beautiful</em>.” (Ps. 147:1). The New Testament also exhorts you to rejoice in God’s holy character: “<em>Rejoice in the Lord always</em>; again I will say, <em>rejoice</em>!” (Phil. 4:4). Thus, if you are merely going through the motions when you worship at church, stop and examine your heart.  God does not want meaningless praise.</p></li>

<h2 id="righteousness-praise-jesus-for-his-just-righteousness.-ps.-989."><strong>7. <u>Righteousness: Praise Jesus for His Just Righteousness</u>. Ps. 98:9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge the world with justice and righteousness</u>. The psalmist concluded by promising that God was coming to judge the entire world with justice and righteousness: “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for He is coming to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with fairness</em>.” (Ps. 98:9). “The strong and deep praise described in this psalm is not only for the <em>marvelous things</em> God has done (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+98.1&amp;t=NKJV">Psalm 98:1</a>). It is also for the work He is about to do – <strong>with righteousness He shall judge the world</strong>. His righteous rule and reign will be a welcome relief for all creation that has suffered under the sin and rebellion of mankind.” (David Guzik on Ps. 98:9) (bold in original).<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Jesus will come to judge with justice and righteousness<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is our righteous judge  (2 Tim. 4:8). “I can do nothing on My own initiative.  As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.”  (Jo. 5:30). “But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent Me.”  (Jo. 8:16).  While David, Solomon, and Israel’s other kings sinned, Jesus never will.  His reign will be perfect, just, and righteous. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Spirit of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will rest on Him, <em>the spirit of wisdom and understanding</em> . . . <em>with righteousness He will judge</em> the poor, and decide with fairness for the humble of the earth; . . . <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Also righteousness will be the belt around His hips, and faithfulness the belt around His waist.” (Is. 11:1-5). “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with <em>justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore</em>.”  (Is. 9:7; 16:5).  “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  He will judge evil and deliver His people. Thus, you can praise Him because He will be fair, just, and right every wrong against you.</p></li>
