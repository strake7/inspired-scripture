<h1 id="proverbs-19-lessons-for-living-according-to-gods-morality"><strong>Proverbs 19: Lessons for Living According to God’s Morality</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, Solomon provides lessons for living according to God’s morality. These include: (1) personal integrity, (2) integrity with others, (3) submitting to God’s wisdom, (4) honoring family, (5) loving God and others, (6) seeking spiritual growth, and (7) fearing God.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one through three, Solomon gives three different examples of living with personal integrity. God cares more about what is in your heart and your actions than your public vows of piety. <u>Second</u>, in verses four through seven, Solomon provides examples of morality when dealing with others. If a believer fails to act with integrity within the community, it both undermines God’s intended order for society, and it deters non-believers from turning to God. <u>Third</u>, in verses eight through 12, Solomon provides examples for believers to follow in submitting to God’s wisdom. You cannot claim to live according to God’s morality if you draw wisdom from yourself or from some other worldly source. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 13 through 15, Solomon gives examples for honoring and supporting your family. The family plays an important role in God’s intended order for supporting one another and raising the next generation of believers. Thus, you cannot claim to follow God’s morality if you are undermining the family that He gave you. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 16 and 17, Solomon urged believers to obey God and provide for those in need. If you love God and your neighbor, the two greatest commandments, following God’s morality will become an easy act of devotion, not obligation. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 18 through 22, Solomon provides examples regarding how believers should constantly seek out and follow godly counsel and discipline. To sustain your walk in God’s morality, you need to constantly grow in your walk by seeking out God’s wisdom on a regular basis. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 23 through 29, Solomon provides several examples regarding the consequences that follow from failing to live according to God’s morality. To maintain your walk in God’s morality, you must also fear Him by hating that which He defines as evil. Even though Solomon was given greater wisdom than any other person before Jesus, his failure to fear God caused him to stray from God.</p>

Prov. 19:1-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Personal integrity with poverty is better than wealth with evil</u>. Solomon begins by urging believers to choose personal integrity over the temptations of wealth. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than a person who is perverse in speech and is a fool</em>.” (Prov. 19:1). “Moral standards are important to an upright man, and he is not disgraced by the fact that he does not have the riches of the world, but he has chosen to live and to die with integrity. The fool is not so, he will flow with the current, his ways can be changed by the sound of change, he sells out cheap.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 19:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word guide your all decisions</u>. If you let the world guide what is important in your life, you are likely to slowly compromise your integrity and your walk with God. “but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the insignificant things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are, so that no human may boast before God.” (1 Cor. 1:27-29). “Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: did God not choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?” (Jam. 2:5; Lk. 6:20; Matt. 5:3). Wealth is not evil. But God wants you to be content with you have. “But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it, either. If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content. But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction.” (1 Tim. 6:6-9).</p></li>

<p>Living with integrity is worth far more than the pursuit of worldly wealth<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Seek out the knowledge that God offers to stay on the right path</u>. Pursuing wealth without God’s guidance can slowly compromise your values. Thus, God wants you to constantly seek out His wisdom to guide your path. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, and one who hurries his footsteps errs</em>.” (Prov. 19:2). “Solomon insists that ambition without diligence or knowledge puts a person at risk. Without weighing all the facts of a matter (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-13.html"><u>Proverbs 18:13</u></a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-17.html"><u>17</u></a>), an ambitious person may rush into a situation, only to discover severe consequences. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-12.html"><u>Proverbs 14:12</u></a> explains, ‘There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.’ Wisdom and truth are often compared to a path (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-26.html"><u>Proverbs 4:26</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-10.html"><u>15:10</u></a>). Those who fail to watch their steps are inclined to become lost: to ‘miss their way.’ Other proverbs note that rash decision-making can lead to failure (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/21/Proverbs-21-5.html"><u>Proverbs 21:5</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/28/Proverbs-28-20.html"><u>28:20</u></a>). The Bible counters ‘haste makes waste’ decisions by exhorting believers to trust in the Lord for guidance. His wisdom promises clear direction (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/James/1/James-1-5.html"><u>James 1:5</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-8.html"><u>Proverbs 14:8</u></a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/14/Proverbs-14-15.html"><u>15</u></a>).” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 19:2).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God may be forced to discipline believers when they reject His wisdom and knowledge</u>. God sent Israel into exile because of their refusal to learn and obey His Word. “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Since you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the Law of your God, I also will forget your children.” (Hosea 4:6). “Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge; and their nobles are famished, and their multitude is parched with thirst.” (Is. 5:13). Because they failed to constantly seek out God’s wisdom, they also failed to recognize Jesus as their Lord. “Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them [the Israelites] is for their salvation. For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God’s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.” (Rom. 10:1-3). God’s wisdom and knowledge are freely available in His Word. “But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Jam. 1:5; Prov. 2:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>If you let anything other than God guide you, you might ultimately turn against Him</u>. If you fail to restrain your heart from evil, you may ultimately turn against God when you suffer from your sins. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>The foolishness of a person ruins his way, and his heart rages against the Lord</em>.” (Prov. 19:3). If you make small compromises in your walk, your heart may slowly turn against God over time. “The phrase “The foolishness of man undermines his way” indicates that our actions can complicate our lives. Each of us has a part to play in this understanding. When we act unwisely, we miss out on the plans God has for us, and those consequences can be far-reaching. It’s essential to see our role—the choices we make can lead to unexpected hurdles. Next, we see that “his heart frets against the Lord,” highlighting how we often project our frustrations onto God. When we experience hardships as a result of our unwise decisions, we might become angry or resentful toward God. This isn’t fair to Him, as He created us with free will and desires our happiness. Our frustrations, instead, should lead us back to Him in search of comfort and direction. Likewise, it’s vital to note that taking responsibility for our choices is a huge part of growing in faith. When we blame external factors or God, we miss the opportunity for learning and growth. This verse encourages us to own our decisions and seek God’s assistance in making wise choices.” (ChristianityPath.com on Prov. 19:3).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Never blame God when you suffer because of sin</u>. If you embrace temptation, you should never blame God when you suffer from the consequences of your sins. “No one is to say when he is tempted, ‘I am being tempted by God’; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it has run its course, brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:13-15). “For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasonings, and their senseless hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools,” (Rom. 1:21-22; Is. 29:14; 1 Cor. 1:18).</p></li>

<h2 id="integrity-with-others-living-according-to-gods-morality-also-requires-that-your-actions-toward-others-reflect-gods-values.-prov.-194-7."><strong>2. <u>Integrity With Others: Living According to God’s Morality Also Requires That Your Actions Toward Others Reflect God’s Values</u>. Prov. 19:4-7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Do not use wealth as a criteria for selecting friends</u>. People with worldly values seek out wealthy friends. Believers should instead show integrity by selecting friends based upon their character and faith. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Wealth adds many friends, but a poor person is separated from his friend</em>.” (Prov. 19:4). “1. We may see how strong men’s love of money is, that they will love any man, how undeserving soever he be otherwise, if he has but a deal of money and is free with it, so that they may hope to be the better for it. Wealth enables a man to send many presents, make many entertainments, and do many good offices, and so gains him many friends, who pretend to love him, for they flatter him and make their court to him, but really love what he has, or rather love themselves, hoping to get by him. 2. We may see how weak men's love of one another is. He who, while he prospered, was beloved and respected, if he fall into poverty is <em>separated from his neighbor,</em> is not owned nor looked upon, not visited nor regarded, is bidden to keep his distance and told he is troublesome. Even one that has been his neighbor and acquaintance will turn his face from him and pass by on the other side.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 19:4).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not show favoritism based on wealth</u>. In our fallen world, many, many will sadly show favoritism based upon wealth. “The poor is hated even by his neighbor, but those who love the rich are many.” (Prov. 14:20). But God does not show favoritism. “Opening his mouth, Peter said: ‘I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality, but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.”’ (Acts 10:34-35). “For there is no partiality with God.” (Ro. 2:11). “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Gal. 3:28). Thus, believers should also not show favoritism to others based upon worldly wealth. “My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and is dressed in bright clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, ‘You sit here in a good place,’ and you say to the poor man, ‘You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,’ have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?” (Jam. 2:1-4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Having integrity requires that you tell the truth</u>. Even when telling the truth is difficult, a person with integrity will always tell the truth. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who declares lies will not escape</em>.” (Prov. 19:5). “As v.3 threatens punishment of those who hasten to get rich in v. 2, v. 5 threatens the punishment of the liar of v. 1, probably with reference to a courtroom setting. A rare precise synonymous parallelism, <em>a perjurer</em> (see 12:17) <em>will not escape punishment</em> (see 6:29), <em>and a witness who lies will not escape</em> punishment, emphasizes the certainty of a perjurer’s punishment. The ultimate Agent who unmasks the perjurer and inflicts punishment is <em>I AM</em> (see 19:3; cf. 16:1-9).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 19:5).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p>God will judge perjurers who fail to repent of their sins<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Being a truthful witness is vital for God’s intended order for society</u>. Perjury is offensive to God, and it violates His Ninth Commandment. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.” (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). God will also severely punish those who commit perjury. “If a malicious witness rises up against a person to testify against him of wrongdoing, then both people who have the dispute shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who will be in office in those days. And the judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false witness and he has testified against his brother falsely, then you shall do to him just as he had planned to do to his brother. So you shall eliminate the evil from among you.” (Dt. 19:16-19). “A false witness will perish, but a person who listens will speak forever.” (Prov. 21:28; Ps. 101:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give gifts with the right motives</u>. Gifts should be given out of kindness, respect, or to make peace. Gifts should not be given for your personal benefit. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>Many will seek the favor of a generous person, and every person is a friend to him who gives gifts</em>.” (Prov. 19:6). “<a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/proverbs/proverbs_19_6/"><u>Proverbs 19:6</u></a> beckons us to evaluate the motives underpinning our relationships and to prioritize authentic connections over those rooted in material benefits. It challenges us to embody generosity without strings attached and to value individuals for who they are, not for what they can offer us. This verse serves as a timeless beacon, guiding us towards cultivating relationships based on sincerity, empathy, and mutual respect.” (Reverend Michael Johnson, God’sBless.ing on Prov. 19:6).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Gifts given with the right motives serve God’s purposes</u>. Gifts given out of kindness help you to live in harmony with others. “A person’s gift makes room for him and brings him before great people.” (Prov. 18:16). Gifts also calm disputes. “A gift in secret subdues anger, ...” (Prov. 21:14). Giving to the poor also reflects Jesus’ love. “The wicked borrows and does not pay back, but the righteous is gracious and gives.” (Ps. 37:21). “Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.” (Matt. 5:42). “Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.” (1 Tim. 6:17-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Do not judge people who are poor</u>. After condemning people who favor the rich in verse four, Solomon condemned those who shunned the poor. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>All the brothers of a poor person hate him; how much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone</em>.” (Prov. 19:7). “To be poor is often to be rejected by men, even by <strong>brothers</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. What a contrast to Jesus, who Himself became poor (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=2Corinthians+8.9&amp;t=NKJV"><u>2 Corinthians 8:9</u></a>) to draw near to us in our poverty and need … By nature, people run from the poor person, even when he tries to persuade and <strong>pursue them with words</strong>. In contrast, God pursues the poor and needy.” (David Guzik on Prov. 19:7).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Show God’s love to those who are in need</u>. Many sadly abandon those who become poor. For example, Job’s friends and family abandoned him when he lost his wealth. “He has removed my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances have completely turned away from me. My relatives have failed, and my close friends have forgotten me.” (Job 19:13-14). “So I said, ‘Wisdom is better than strength.’ But the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are ignored.” (Ecc. 9:16; Prov, 18:23). God’s love, however, is not within you if you see a brother or sister in need and then look the other way. “But whoever has worldly goods and sees his brother or sister in need, and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God remain in him?” (1 Jo. 3:17).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>In order to live according to God’s integrity, you must constantly seek out His wisdom</u>. Seeking wisdom through Jesus allows you to live out God’s morality and will for you. More importantly, His wisdom leads to your eternal salvation when you accept Jesus your Lord and Savior. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>One who gets wisdom loves his own soul; one who keeps understanding will find good</em>.” (Prov. 19:8). “He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul,.... he that gets Christ, the Wisdom of God, and a saving knowledge of him; …he that keepeth understanding shall find good; retains the wisdom he has got; holds fast instruction, and keeps it, which is committed to him; abides by the doctrines of the Gospel, and does not depart from them; keeps the ordinances of it, which it is his wisdom and understanding to do;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 19:8).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-19/media/image5.jpg" style="width:6.53125in;height:2.81771in" alt="Wisdom of the Day from Proverbs 19" /></p>
<p>Jesus’ wisdom offers the blessing of eternal life<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is revealed through Jesus</u>. Jesus is the wisdom of God incarnate (1 Cor. 1:24, 30; Col. 2:3; Lk. 11:49). Because the wisdom that Jesus offers leads to eternal life (Jo. 3:16), it is better than gold. “Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her produce better than gold. She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her. Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.” (Prov. 3:13-16). Thus, every person should do what they can to acquire the wisdom that Jesus offers. “Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. Do not abandon her, and she will guard you; love her, and she will watch over you.” (Prov. 4:5-6). “For wisdom is protection just as money is protection, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom keeps its possessors alive.” (Ecc. 7:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submitting to Jesus’ wisdom also requires being truthful</u>.  Because truthful testimony is critical to the justice system, Solomon repeated for emphasis God’s condemnation against perjury. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who declares lies will perish</em>.” (Prov. 19:9). “A repetition of ver. 5, except that shall perish is substituted for ‘shall not escape.’ Septuagint, ‘And whosoever shall kindle mischief shall perish by it.’ The Greek translators have rendered the special reference in the original to slanderers and liars by a general term, and introduced the notion of Divine retribution, which is not definitely expressed in the Hebrew. Proverbs 19:9.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 19:9).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><u>For the unsaved, God will judge both perjurers and liars</u>.  In the context of perjury, God sees anyone who provides false statements as treacherous and deceitful (Prov. 12:17; 14:25).  Perjury is offensive to God because it undermines His perfect justice (Dt. 19:15).  Because the administration of justice is so important to God, God commands that court vows be in His name (Dt. 6:13).  But when a person gives false testimony after giving an oath under God’s name, that person takes the Lord’s name in vain (Lev. 19:12).  For the unsaved, the penalty for profaning God’s name through perjury brings eternal death:  “A false witness will perish, but the man who listens to the truth will speak forever.”  (Prov. 21:18). For those who might feel confident that they are in no need of God’s mercy because they have never committed perjury in its strictest definition, He warns that His wrath will be poured out upon all the unsaved who suppress the truth or lie (Prov. 19:9; Rom. 1:18).  Unsaved liars are also barred from heaven (Rev. 21:8, 27).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Submitting to God’s wisdom also requires being content with your provision</u>. A person who refuses to submit to God’s wisdom will also make foolish choices when pursuing wealth and careers. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Luxury is not fitting for a fool; much less for a slave to rule over princes</em>.” (Prov. 19:10). “There are several important lessons we can draw from Proverbs 19:10. The first is the urgency of having discernment in our pursuits … We are reminded of the value of being selective in what we engage with; not everything brings joy, and discerning this becomes a central part of living wisely. The second lesson lies in recognizing the importance of roles and respect. Authority structures exist for a reason, as they promote order and accountability. When we act in ways that respect established roles, we not only demonstrate wisdom but also foster healthy relationships among peers, families, and communities. It’s a reminder of how it may be damaging to undermine these roles, which can lead to chaos and confusion. As supporters of wisdom, we ought to focus on affirming those in their rightful places while continuing to nurture our own growth, ultimately aspiring to be wise leaders in our respective circles. Lastly, the message encourages us to align our character with our decisions. Wisdom isn’t just knowing what is right; it’s about embodying those principles in life. Being wise invites us to act with integrity and sincerity, not merely to seek personal gain, but instead to uplift others and walk alongside them in love. We become vessels of change by letting go of pride and embracing humility—we ultimately mirror the heart of Christ, leading others toward God’s truth and grace.” (Jamie Wilson, ExplainingtheBible, Prov. 19:10).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Submitting to God’s wisdom includes submitting to His sovereign plans</u>. God has prepared in advance good works for believers to accomplish (Eph. 2:10). In the first half of the proverb, God warns that a fool fails to understand that every good and perfect gift, including wealth, is from God (Jam. 1:17; Matt. 25:14-15). The fool squanders God’s gifts by storing up treasures on Earth instead of in heaven (Matt. 6:19-20). In the second half of the proverb, God warns people who misuse the skills that He has given them. In another similar proverb, God warns against the servant who becomes king (Prov. 30:21-22). To a modern reader, this might look like a condemnation against social mobility. But God transformed Joseph from being a lowly slave into the second most powerful mun under Pharaoh (Gen. 41:37-44). He also transformed David from being a lowly shepherd (1 Sam. 16:11) and a lowly servant in Saul’s court (1 Sam. 16:14-23) into the King of Israel (2 Sam. 5:1-4). Thus, the proverbs condemns those who cause chaos by taking on roles that they were never prepared for or misusing God’s resources.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submitting to Jesus’ wisdom includes being temperate and forgiving</u>. God wants you to always control your anger and be quick to forgive others who offend you. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>A person’s discretion makes him slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense</em>.” (Prov. 19:11). “<em>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger — </em>Defers the admission of anger, till he has thoroughly considered all the merits of the provocation, seen them in a true light, and weighed them in a just balance; and then defers the prosecution of it, till there be no danger of going into indecencies of speech or behavior … <em>And it is his glory to pass over a transgression</em> — Not to revenge a wrong, or an affront, when he hath an opportunity. This is opposed to the perverse judgment of worldly men, who account it folly and stupidity not quickly to resent a provocation, and a dishonor and reproach not to revenge it.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 19:11).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-19/media/image1.jpg" style="width:5.98967in;height:3.06142in" alt="Proverbs 19:11 – Slow to Anger – Encouraging Bible Verses" /></p>
<p>Be slow to anger and quick to forgive<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God wants you to be slow to anger and merciful as He is with you</u>. If you are slow to anger and quick to forgive, you show that you are living out Jesus’ wisdom. “One who is slow to anger has great understanding; but one who is quick-tempered exalts foolishness.” (Prov. 14:29). “A hot-tempered person stirs up strife, But the slow to anger calms a dispute.” (Prov. 15:18). “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, For anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20; Matt. 5:22).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submitting to God’s wisdom includes submitting to authority in most circumstances</u>. Many leaders are sadly carnal and out of their fleshly desires. But they still enjoy their authority through God’s sovereignty. Unless you are asked to do evil, submitting to authority benefits you. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>A king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass</em>.” (Prov. 19:12). “Respect and submission to rulers is a rule of wisdom. They can hurt you badly or help you greatly (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2016.14-15;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 16:14-15</u></a>). A lion’s roar, audible at over five miles in the African night, causes terror in men’s hearts like an angry king can cause in his enemies. As the dew nourishes grass to grow and prosper, so a king’s favor can bring success. The lesson is a reminder to honor and obey civil rulers and all in authority for the obvious advantages. If you rebel against a ruler, you are begging for pain and trouble, because he has power and strength (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2016.14;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 16:14</u></a>). Rebellion is as wise as taking on a lion in the night without weapons (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2020.2;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 20:2</u></a>)! Of course, some fools are so arrogant, ignorant, and rebellious that they resist or slander most authority they meet. But their end is as certain as the native caught by a man-eater in the dark! God and men will chew and devour them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2017.11;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 17:11</u></a>). If you obey and serve a state or ruler, you secure the peace, protection, and provision that can assist and promote you and your endeavors (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2016.15;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 16:15</u></a>). He can help and nurture you as much as moisture supplies grass with the sustenance necessary for life and growth. Friends in high places are one of the simplest rules of wisdom for your success. It is only pride and stupidity that causes men to squander this opportunity by offending authority.” (LetGodbeTrue.com, Prov. 19:12).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Placating a worldly leader can sometimes bring calm and peace to a community</u>. Solomon gave a similar prior proverb regarding worldly leaders. “The fury of a king is like messengers of death; but a wise person will appease it. In the light of a king’s face is life, and his favor is like a cloud with the spring rain.” (Prov. 16:14-15). When a worldly leader is placated, his or her subjects benefit. An example of this was when Pharaoh appointed Joseph to be the second most powerful person in Egypt (Gen. 41:37-44). Another example was when the Persian King Ahasuerus (aka Xerxes) appointed Mordecai as the number two person (Esth. 8:1-7; 10:3). In both cases, the king’s favor brought blessings (symbolized as rain) on God’s people. But believers must avoid seeking the favor of powerful people. “The fear of man brings a snare, but one who trusts in the LORD will be protected.” (Prov. 29:25). Instead, believers should seek Jesus’ favor and trust Him to provide. “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in noblemen.” (Ps. 118:9). “Many are saying, ‘Who will show us anything good?’ Lift up the light of Your face upon us, LORD!” (Ps. 4:6; 30:5; 31:16; 80:3; Nu. 6:25).</p></li>

Prov. 19:13-15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>To live according to God’s morality, you must also honor your family</u>. Children and spouses who dishonor their families undermine the family order that God created. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>A foolish son is destruction to his father, and the quarrels of a wife are a constant dripping</em>.” (Prov. 19:13). “Some principles in Scripture are phrased in male terms but apply to all of mankind. Many parents have experienced the brutal pain of watching their children pursue foolish, ungodly paths (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-1.html"><u>Proverbs 4:1–4</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-1.html"><u>10:1</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/17/Proverbs-17-2.html"><u>17:2</u></a>). When the child’s choices are especially wrong, it can ‘ruin’ the parents. That is usually true emotionally, but a child's actions might bring social shame and financial hardship on their parents, as well. Later in this chapter, Solomon will speak about the overtly abusive child who directly harms his own family (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/19/Proverbs-19-26.html"><u>Proverbs 19:26</u></a>). A foolish person has no regard for God (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/3/Proverbs-3-11.html"><u>Proverbs 3:11</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-17.html"><u>10:17</u></a>). He rebels against the spiritual training given by godly parents (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-5.html"><u>Proverbs 15:5</u></a>). Solomon also observes that a disagreeable spouse can be a source of constant misery (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/21/Proverbs-21-9.html"><u>Proverbs 21:9</u></a>). The Hebrew word used here is a reference to arguments, stress, and bickering. The imagery of rain here implies something like a leak in a roof, rather than rain in general (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/27/Proverbs-27-15.html"><u>Proverbs 27:15</u></a>). Spouses don't have to be overtly abusive to bring misery into a marriage. A constant ‘drip’ of negativity, arguing, unhappiness, criticism, or other irritations can become toxic. The picture painted here is the opposite of how the apostle Peter presents the ideal of marriage: dwelling together as partners in the grace of life (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/3/1-Peter-3-6.html"><u>1 Peter 3:6–7</u></a>).” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 19:13).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Rebellion within the family is an evil that God repeatedly condemned</u>. Many other proverbs condemn rebellious children. “A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.” (Prov. 10:1). “A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother.” (Prov. 15:20). “A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her who gave birth to him.” (Prov. 17:25). Other similar proverbs also condemn quarrelsome spouses. “It is better to live on a corner of a roof than in a house shared with a contentious woman.” (Prov. 21:9). “It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and irritating woman.” (Prov. 21:19). “It is better to live on a corner of the roof, than in a house shared with a contentious woman.” (Prov. 25:24). “A constant dripping on a day of steady rain and a contentious woman are alike;” (Prov. 27:15). A family should submit to Jesus’ authority and love each other just as He loved the Church. “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,” (Eph. 5:25). This also includes being kind to each other. “Husbands, love your wives and do not become bitter against them.” (Col. 3:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Treat your family as a gift from God</u>. God deserves honor for His many gifts, including your spouse. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the Lord</em>.” (Prov. 19:14). “If you have a good wife, you got her from the Lord. You ought to thank the Lord for her, by the way. Have you ever done that? Thank you Lord for your good wife, because He is the One who gave her to you. Young men, this should tell you something. Do you want a good wife? The one who gives away the good wives is not the father of the daughter. Many a father is glad to get rid of his daughter. But our Heavenly Father has a lot of good wives to give away. Keep in touch with Him, and He will lead you to the right one. He wants to give you the right kind of wife. This is a very practical proverb. Don’t you agree?” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 19:14).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Love your spouse the same way that Jesus showed selfless love at the cross</u>. A God-fearing spouse should be honored as a gift from God (Prov. 19:14). “He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.” (Prov. 18:22). “An excellent wife, who can find her? For her worth is far above jewels.” (Prov. 31:10). God created marriage for love, companionship, support, and to raise the next generation of believers (Gen. 2:18-24). Thus, you must first search for a God-fearing spouse through prayer and careful examination to avoid being unequally yoked (2 Cor. 6:14). You should then treat your spouse as a treasure greater than wealth. “An excellent wife, who can find her? For her worth is far above jewels.” (Prov. 31:10). Each spouse should also honor the other with righteous and faithful conduct. “An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who shames him is like rottenness in his bones.” (Prov. 12:3; 1 Tim. 3:11; 1 Cor. 7:2-5). Finally, each spouse should love and submit to each other the same way Jesus did out love for His Church (Eph. 5:25-33; 1 Pet. 3:1-7; Col. 3:18-19).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Honor your God-given family through hard work</u>. Within the context of the proverbs related to family, Solomon urged every person to be a hard worker to support their families. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger</em>.” (Prov. 19:15). “The word for ‘sleep’ (<span dir="rtl">תַרדֵמָה</span>, <strong>tardemah</strong>) is that used for the supernatural sleep of Adam when Eve was formed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-21.htm"><u>Genesis 2:21</u></a>), and implies profound insensibility … Slothfulness enervates a man, renders him as useless for labor as if he were actually asleep in his bed; it also enfeebles the mind, corrupts the higher faculties, converts a rational being into a witless animal.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 19:15).<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who fail to use their talents for the good of the community</u>. Solomon repeatedly urged believers to be diligent workers and avoid the sin of slothfulness (Prov. 6:6-11; 10:4-5; 12:24; 13:4; 16:26; 18:9; 20:4; 21:25; Ecc. 10:18). Jesus also warns against failing to use your spiritual gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30; 2 Thess. 3:10-12). Jesus will also condemn gossip because of the harm it causes.</p></li>

Prov. 19:16-17.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Living according to God’s morality requires that you keep His Ten Commandments</u>. If you fail to keep God’s Ten Commandments and repent when you fall short, you cannot claim to be living according to His standards of morality. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>One who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but one who is careless of conduct will die</em>.” (Prov. 19:16). “If we keep God’s word, God's word will keep us from everything really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 19:16).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Obedience should be an act of love and the fruit of your faith</u>. If you love Jesus, you will want to keep His Ten Commandments. “The one who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.” (Jo. 14:21). If you follow Jesus’ Word, He will also protect you. “Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine, and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of Mine, and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and its collapse was great.” (Matt. 7:24-27). But He said, ‘On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it.”’ (Lk. 11:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also wants you to help others</u>. Loving God is the greatest Commandment. Loving others is the second (Matt. 22:36-40). “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>One who is gracious to a poor person lends to the Lord, and He will repay him for his good deed</em>.” (Prov. 19:17). “This proverb turns to the subunit’s goal in youth’s education: to show kindness to the poor with the motivation that <em>I AM</em> will reward them (cf., 14:21, 31; 22:9; 28:27). <em>Whoever shows grace</em> (cf. 14:31) <em>to the poor</em> (see 10:15) <em>lends to I AM</em> teaches that in giving generously to the destitute they are figuratively giving a loan to <em>I AM</em>. The parallel explains the figure: <em>for their deeds, he will repay them. I AM</em>, who made the poor, assumes their indebtedness, and so he will repay the lender in full with interest (cf. 11:17, 25; Pss. 41:1-3; 112:5; Matt. 25:31-40; Lk. 6:38; Jas. 1:27). Thus, the wise stand with the poor, unlike the world (see 19:7).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs 19:17).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your treatment of those in need should reflect your faith in Jesus</u>. Jesus will bless those who are faithful to help others in need. “One who despises his neighbor sins, but one who is gracious to the poor is blessed.” (Prov. 14:21; 28:27). But Jesus also warns that people will be held accountable based upon whether they showed His love to the poor. “Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’ Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You as a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine, you did it for Me.’ Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;” (Matt. 25:34-41; 1 Jo. 3:17).</p></li>

<h2 id="seeking-spiritual-growth-living-according-to-gods-morality-also-requires-that-you-constantly-seek-out-gods-wisdom-to-grow-spiritually.-prov.-1918-22."><strong>6. <u>Seeking Spiritual Growth: Living According to God’s Morality Also Requires That You Constantly Seek Out God’s Wisdom to Grow Spiritually</u>. Prov. 19:18-22.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Living according to God’s morality includes seeking constant spiritual growth</u>. You must always humble yourself to grow in God’s wisdom and accept discipline when you fall short. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>Discipline your son while there is hope, and do not desire his death</em>.” (Prov. 19:18). “Proverbs 19:18 delivers a powerful and important message regarding the responsibility of parents to guide and discipline their children. It serves as a reminder that parenting is not just about love and care but also about teaching our children the right values and behaviors. The verse suggests that discipline should be administered while there is still hope for correction. There is a sense of urgency in this message, as it implies that failure to act could lead to dire consequences. When we look at the word “chasten,” it means to discipline or correct. This does not mean to punish in a harsh way but to instruct and guide. It is important to remember that correction should stem from love. God instructs us to train our children to ensure that they grow up into responsible, loving, and honest individuals.” (ChristianityPath.com on Prov. 19:18).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Accepting discipline is important for your spiritual growth</u>. Solomon repeatedly extolled the importance of godly discipline. “He who withholds his rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him diligently.” (Prov. 13:24). “Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he grows older he will not abandon it.” (Prov. 22:6). “Do not withhold discipline from a child; though you strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod and rescue his soul from Sheol.” (Prov. 23:13-14). “It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?” (Heb. 12:7-9; Eph. 6:4).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God wants you to be discerning in who you spend your time with</u>. If you become friends with a wrathful person, you risk becoming entangled in their sins. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>A person of great anger will suffer the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will only have to do it again</em>.” (Prov. 19:19). “The lessons are simple. First, if you do not rule your anger, God and men will punish you for your temper. A wise man will confess his angry spirit, beg God to help him, and obey the proverbs about anger. Second, if you help a person with a bad temper, you will be helping him again next month, for he cannot learn to get along with others. His selfish spirit and hot temper will explode again against some little offence, real or perceived. Neither anger nor a temper is noble. It is not a sign of manliness or authority. It is not the evidence of a strong man – it is the proof of a weak fool (<a href="https://ref.ly/Eccles%207.9;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Eccl 7:9</u></a>). A great man rules his spirit and controls his anger; fools are ruled by their spirits and controlled by their anger. Wrath is blinding and binding, so that helping a quick-tempered man out of trouble caused by his anger will not protect him for long; he will sin again by anger very soon.” (LetGodbeTrue.com on Prov. 19:19).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God wants you to avoid quarrelsome people</u>. God warns that associating with hot-tempered people can become a snare in your walk. “Do not make friends with a person given to anger, or go with a hot-tempered person, or you will learn his ways and find a snare for yourself.” (Prov. 22:24-25; 14:17). “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, for anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9; Ps. 37:8). “The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged,” (2 Tim. 2:24). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20; Col. 3:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Accepting discipline allows you to grow in wisdom</u>. Accepting God’s discipline, allows for your spiritual growth. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>Listen to advice and accept discipline, so that you may be wise the rest of your days</em>.” (Prov. 19:20). “There are several lessons we can draw from this verse. One primary lesson is the importance of being receptive to advice. This requires a level of humility, as we must acknowledge that we do not have all the answers. It encourages us to value the experiences and insights of others. Another lesson is the significance of seeking out wise advice. Not every source of information is reliable, so we should carefully choose whom to listen to and learn from. Surrounding ourselves with wise mentors can lead to making better decisions. We should also remember that accepting advice doesn’t make us weak. Instead, it shows strength, as it requires us to let go of pride and recognize our limitations. This quality will serve us well in life, professionally and personally. Lastly, the promise of gaining wisdom in the future signifies evolution. We should strive to be better today than we were yesterday, and actively seeking wisdom is crucial for this growth. This shows that the effort we put into listening and learning has lasting benefits.” (Jamie Wilson on Prov. 19:20).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Accept God’s wisdom to stay on His path</u>. You should seek out and follow godly advice to avoid sin. “Listen to instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.” (Prov. 8:33). “Extend your ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my knowledge; for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, so that they may be ready on your lips.” (Prov. 22:17-18). “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a person who listens to advice is wise.” (Prov. 12:15). Believers must also be ready to accept godly discipline when they stray from God’s path. “My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD or loathe His rebuke, for whom the LORD loves He disciplines, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.” (Prov. 3:11-12; Heb. 12:11; Rev. 3:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Living according to God’s morality includes accepting His will as sovereign</u>. God also wants you to always seek out His will for you. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>Many plans are in a person’s heart, but the advice of the Lord will stand</em>.” (Prov. 19:21). “The passage … challenges us to reflect on the value of aligning our plans with divine wisdom. This verse serves as a reminder to acknowledge the sovereignty of God in our endeavors and invites a spirit of humility. As humanity often devises schemes, we see that it is God’s counsel that shapes reality. Our motives may falter, but God’s wisdom is unshakeable; it assures that His plans for us are benevolent. When we strive in alignment with God’s guidance, we find more than success; we discover fulfillment.” (TheBibleSay.com on Prov. 19:21).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-19/media/image6.jpg" style="width:6.02832in;height:2.29445in" alt="Proverbs 19:21 - Bible verse - DailyVerses.net" /></p>
<p>Place your trust in God’s sovereign plans for your life<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s will can never be challenged</u>. Although God gives you free will, you will fail if you try to challenge His will. “I know that You can do all things, and that no plan is impossible for You.” (Job 42:2). “But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.” (Ps. 115:3). “The LORD of armies has sworn, saying, ‘Certainly, just as I have intended, so it has happened, and just as I have planned, so it will stand,”’ (Is. 14:24). “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, ‘My plan will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure’;” (Is. 46:10). “All the inhabitants of the earth are of no account, but He does according to His will among the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can fend off His hand Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35). “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Rom. 8:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s will includes both kindness and holiness</u>. Your spiritual growth should include showing all of God’s holy characteristics together. Thus, kindness is not godly if it does not include honesty. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>What is desirable in a person is his kindness, and it is better to be a poor person than a liar</em>.” (Prov. 19:22). “<strong>What is desired in a man is kindness</strong>: It is not that <strong>kindness</strong> is the highest or only virtue for the people of God. Yet, in many ways, it is the one most <strong>desired</strong> by others, especially in a modern world. <strong>A poor man is better than a liar</strong>: This proverb shows that <strong>kindness</strong>, though valuable, is not the only virtue. To be a man or woman of <em>truth</em> – to not be a <strong>liar</strong> – is also of great value. This proverb reminds us that though we should pursue and value <strong>kindness</strong>, we should not treat it as the only valued virtue among God’s people.” (David Guzik on Prov. 19:22).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God desires many things as you grow spiritually</u>. In addition to kindness and truth, God desires that you: “Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 82:3-4). “He has told you, mortal one, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8). “Learn to do good; seek justice, rebuke the oppressor, obtain justice for the orphan, plead for the widow’s case.” (Is. 1:17). Most importantly, all these things must be done out of love. “And if I give away all my possessions to charity, and if I surrender my body so that I may glory, but do not have love, it does me no good.” (1 Cor. 13:3).</p></li>

<h2 id="fearing-god-living-according-to-gods-morality-also-requires-that-you-fear-god-by-hating-what-he-defines-as-evil-in-his-word.-prov.-1923-29."><strong>7. <u>Fearing God: Living According to God’s Morality Also Requires that You Fear God By Hating What He Defines as Evil in His Word</u>. Prov. 19:23-29.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>To remain on God’s path, you must fear Him by hating evil</u>. As a central theme of proverbs, Solomon repeated the importance of fearing God. “<strong><sup>23</sup></strong> <em>The fear of the Lord leads to life, so that one may sleep satisfied, untouched by evil</em>.” (Prov. 19:23). “True religion, obedience to God’s commandments, was, under a temporal dispensation, rewarded by a long and happy life in this world, an adumbration of the blessedness that awaits the righteous in the world to come. And he that hath it shall abide satisfied … He shall not be visited with evil, according to the, promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm"><u>Leviticus 26:6</u></a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-15.htm"><u>Deuteronomy 11:15</u></a>, etc.). Under our present dispensation Christians expect not immunity from care and trouble, but have hope of protection and grace sufficient for the occasion, and conducive to edification and advance in holiness.” (Pulpit Commentary, Prov. 19:23).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</u>. The fear of the Lord allows you to avoid sin. “The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, by which one may avoid the snares of death.” (Prov. 14:27). Fearing the Lord comes with great rewards. “The reward of humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, honor, and life.” (Prov. 22:4). “Who is the person who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the way he should choose. His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.” (Ps. 25:12-13). “Fear the LORD, you His saints; for to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything. The young lions do without and suffer hunger; but they who seek the LORD will not lack any good thing.” (Ps. 34:9-10). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all those who follow His commandments have a good understanding; His praise endures forever.” (Ps. 111:10). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” (Prov. 9:10; 1:7; Job 28:28). The fear of the LORD is defined as “hating” what Jesus defines as evil in His Word (Prov. 8:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person who is spiritually slothful fails to fear God</u>. Because every person is expected to contribute to God’s kingdom, God condemns those who refuse to work. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>The lazy one buries his hand in the dish, but will not even bring it back to his mouth</em>.” (Prov. 19:24). “The verse from Proverbs 19:24 highlights the characteristics of a sluggard, which is a person who is lazy and avoids work. The imagery of a sluggard burying his hand in a dish but not retrieving food demonstrates an extreme level of laziness. It portrays someone who is so indifferent to their responsibilities that they can’t even muster the energy to feed themselves. This is a serious condemnation of laziness. In life, we are called to be diligent in our tasks and make the most of our abilities. Throughout the Bible, being diligent is linked to prosperity and success while laziness often leads to destruction and poverty.” (William David, BibleOutlined.com on Prov. 19:24).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Spiritual slothfulness is a deadly sin</u>. Solomon gave many similar warnings about the dangers of slothfulness. “ A lazy one buries his hand in the dish; he is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.” (Prov. 26:15; 24:30-31; 10:4-5; 12:24; 13:4; 20:4). “The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work;” (Prov. 21:25; Ecc. 10:18).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Persons who do not fear God will not grow from discipline</u>. A wise person will repent when disciplined. But a wicked person will scheme to avoid being caught. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>Strike a scoffer and the naive may become clever, but rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 19:25). “God always teaches that the wicked are not to be rewarded. The man that has committed wrong should be punished; this will allow others to see that sin does not pay. The man that has God’s instructions can be reproved and he will turn from the paths of sin.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 19:25).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be discerning when you discipline others</u>. God wants you to be discerning when someone might seek to manipulate you with a false repentance. “One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself. Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight.” (Prov. 9:7-9; 23:9; Matt. 7:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A person who assaults their parents does not fear God</u>. Children who assault their parents commit a serious sin before God. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>He who assaults his father and drives his mother away is a shameful and disgraceful son</em>.” (Prov. 19:26). “If you weigh the pain this wicked child caused his parents, you should see the fire of divine justice burning against him. If God’s words, “Be sure your sin will find you out,” are true in general, they are certainly true in this case. A son wastes his father by spending his money in riotous living (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2028.7;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 28:7</u></a>,<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2028.24;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>24</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2029.3;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>29:3</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Luke%2015.13;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Luke 15:13</u></a>). He also wastes his spirit, burdens his heart, harms his health, and sends him to the grave with sorrow (<a href="https://ref.ly/Gen%2044.29;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Gen 44:29</u></a>). This grief is a calamity to a father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2017.21;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 17:21</u></a>,<a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2017.25;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>25</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2019.13;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>19:13</u></a>). What should have been for his glory and success becomes the source of his latter pain … Reader, how well do you honor your heavenly Father? Have you wasted any of the precious grace He has bestowed on you (<a href="https://ref.ly/2%20Cor%206.1;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>II Cor 6:1</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.15;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Heb 12:15</u></a>)? Have you brought any shame or reproach on His glorious name (<a href="https://ref.ly/Ezek%2020.39;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Ezek 20:39</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%206.1;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>I Tim 6:1</u></a>)? Are you living like a child of God, bringing delight to your Father (<a href="https://ref.ly/Matt%205.43-48;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Matt 5:43-48</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/2%20Cor%206.14-18;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>II Cor 6:14-18</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Eph%205.1;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Eph 5:1</u></a>)?” (LetGodbeTrue, Prov. 19:26).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who dishonor or hurt their parents face discipline or punishment</u>. The Fourth Commandment requires children to honor their parents (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Thus, unrepentant sinners those who dishonor, or assault their parents face severe discipline or judgment. “The eye that mocks a father and scorns a mother, the ravens of the valley will pick it out, and the young eagles will eat it.” (Prov. 30:17). “And one who curses his father or his mother shall certainly be put to death.” (Ex. 21:17; Lev. 20:9; Dt. 21:18-21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who stop listening to discipline do not fear God</u>. If you reject discipline, you will one day stray from God. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>Stop listening, my son, to discipline, and you will stray from the words of knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 19:27). “No one ever arrives at a point of ‘knowing it all,’ especially when spiritual truth is involved. The search for wisdom and knowledge is rewarding, but never-ending (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/1/Proverbs-1-5.html"><u>Proverbs 1:5</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-14.html"><u>15:14</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/18/Proverbs-18-1.html"><u>18:1</u></a>). As soon as a person starts relying on themselves, alone, for wisdom, they will begin wandering from the path of truth (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/4/Proverbs-4-26.html"><u>Proverbs 4:26</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-17.html"><u>10:17</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/27/Proverbs-27-17.html"><u>27:17</u></a>). Even the apostle Paul recognized the need to keep learning. From a Roman prison he urged Timothy in <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/4/2-Timothy-4-13.html"><u>2 Timothy 4:13</u></a> to visit him and bring him not only a cloak but ‘also the books, and above all the [copies of Scripture].’ The apostle Peter exhorts us in <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/3/2-Peter-3-18.html"><u>2 Peter 3:18</u></a> to ‘grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”’ (BibleRef.com on Prov. 19:27).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Without correction, a person can easily fall into sin</u>. Persons who stop listening to discipline or correction can fall into false doctrines, including the glorification of themselves (2 Tim. 4:3-4; Eph. 4:18-19). Those who stop listening to God’s wisdom are likely to become spiritually blind (Rom. 1:28-31; 2 Pet. 3:3; 2 Cor. 4:4; Jo. 12:40).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fail to uphold God’s laws do not fear Him</u>. Those who make a mockery of God’s laws will also face severe consequences. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>A worthless witness makes a mockery of justice, and the mouth of the wicked swallows wrongdoing</em>.” (Prov. 19:28). “This verse, nestled within the wisdom literature of the Bible, offers practical insights for leading a righteous life. The phrase “A corrupt witness mocks at justice” vividly portrays the contempt and disregard a deceitful individual holds towards truth and fairness. It paints a stark picture of how dishonesty can erode the very foundations of justice. Similarly, the imagery in the statement “The mouth of the wicked gulps down evil” conveys the voracious appetite wicked individuals have for wrongdoing. It illustrates their eagerness to engage in and perpetuate evil, showcasing a deep-rooted inclination towards malevolence. These phrases serve as poignant reminders of the insidious nature of falsehood and wickedness, urging readers to be vigilant in upholding truth and righteousness.” (Reverend Michael Johnson, GodsBless.ing on Prov, 19:28).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s justice requires truth and integrity</u>. A liar acts under Satan’s influence (Jo. 8:44). Because God is a God of truth (Dt. 32:4), He expects believers to be truthful (Ex. 20:16; 23:1; Lev. 19:11; Eph. 4:25; Col. 3:9; 1 Pet. 3:10). He further “hates” lies (Prov. 6:19). Thus, God condemns false witnesses. “Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD, but those who deal faithfully are His delight.” (Prov. 12:22; 25:18). Those who fail to repent of their lies also face judgment. “You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD loathes the person of bloodshed and deceit.” (Ps. 5:6; 101:7; Prov. 19:5; Rev. 21:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fail to fear God and repent face judgment</u>. Those who mock the Bible’s warnings and fail to repent of their sins will be judged. “<strong><sup>29</sup></strong> <em>Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools</em>.” (Prov. 19:29). “Judgment is coming – that is quite obvious. God is not soft on the guilty. The pleasures of sin are for a season, but the wages of sin last for all eternity.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 19:29).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent of your sins and urge others to also turn to Jesus</u>. Those who fail to repent of their sins and avail themselves of Jesus’ atoning sacrifice face judgment (Prov. 26:3; Ro. 1:18; Heb. 10:29; 2 Pet. 2:9; Matt. 23:33). In addition to repenting of your own sins, Jesus also wants you to share the Good News and help others repent (Matt. 28:16-20).</p></li>
