<h1 id="psalm-149-lessons-for-praising-jesus-as-the-end-times-redeemer"><strong>Psalm 149: Lessons For Praising Jesus as the End Times Redeemer</strong></h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This penultimate psalm is part of the final praise psalms to Yahweh (Ps. 146-150). This psalm foreshadows Jesus’ role as the end times Redeemer when He will defeat evil. “The foregoing psalm was a hymn of praise to the Creator; this is a hymn of praise to the Redeemer. It is a psalm of triumph in the God of Israel, and over the enemies of Israel. Probably it was penned upon occasion of some victory which Israel was blessed and honored with … But it looks further, to the kingdom of the Messiah, who, in the chariot of the everlasting gospel, goes forth conquering and to conquer.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 149).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> “In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-11.htm">Psalm 148:11</a> the nations are summoned to join with Israel in the chorus of universal praise: here their obstinate hostility is represented as doomed to punishment.” (Alexander Francis Kirkpatrick, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Ps. 149).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> From this psalm, the Bible reveals seven lessons for praising Jesus as Your end times Redeemer. Through faith, He offers all believers: (1) new beginnings, (2) sanctification as His bride, (3) joy, (4) eternal salvation, (5) peace, (6) justice, and (7) honor.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, the psalmist prophetically urged believers to offer Yahweh a “new song” of praise. This foreshadowed the praise that Jesus deserves for the “new beginnings” that He offers to all who believe in Him. <u>Second</u>, the psalmist called upon Yahweh’s “<em>godly ones</em>” to offer Him “<em>praise in the congregation</em>.” This foreshadowed the praise that Jesus deserves for sanctifying His bridge, the Church, and the eternal praise His bride will collectively offer Him in heaven. You can praise and worship Jesus with others for sanctifying the Church to be His bride. <u>Third</u>, the psalmist summoned Israel to rejoice in their Maker and their King. This foreshadowed the praise that Jesus deserves both as your Creator and for His redemption as your King of Kings. <u>Fourth</u>, the psalmist urged Yahweh’s people to praise Him because He “<em>takes pleasure in His people</em>,” and “<em>He will glorify the lowly with salvation.</em>” Jesus also deserves praise because He loves His people, and He offers a path for the humble to find salvation through faith in Him. <u>Fifth</u>, the psalmist called upon Yahweh’s “<em>godly ones</em>” to praise Him because they could “<em>sing for joy on their beds</em>.” This foreshadowed the ability of Jesus’ redeemed followers to find peace and rest during the end times. You can also praise Jesus because He offers you peace during any conflict. <u>Sixth</u>, the psalmist declared that the “<em>high praises of God shall be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands</em>.” This foreshadows Jesus’ end times judgment. His Word is sharper than any two-edged sword. You can praise Jesus because He is and will always be a fair and just judge. In His perfect timing, He will judge all evil. <u>Finally</u>, the psalmist urged praise for the honors Yahweh offers. Jesus also deserves praise for the honors He offers all in heaven.</p>
<h2 id="new-beginnings-praise-jesus-for-offering-all-a-new-beginning.-ps.-1491a."><strong>1. <u>New Beginnings: Praise Jesus for Offering All a New Beginning</u>. Ps. 149:1a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Offer Jesus new songs of praise for your redemption</u>. Following an unknown victory, the psalmist urged the Jews to offer Yahweh a new song of praise for Israel’s redemption: “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Sing a new song to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,..</em>.” (Ps. 149:1a). “A ‘new song’ on account of a new deliverance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>). The deliverance may have been one of those under Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2-16</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 149:1).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> “All his works were, in the foregoing psalm, excited to praise him; but here his saints in a particular manner are required to bless him. Observe then, 1. Who are called upon to praise God. Israel in general, the body of the church (v. 2), the children of Zion particularly, the inhabitants of that holy hill, who are nearer to God than other Israelites; those that have the word and ordinances of God near to them, that are not required to travel far to them, are justly expected to do more in praising God than others. All true Christians may call themselves the children of Zion, for in faith and hope we have come unto Mount Zion, Heb. 12:22.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 149:1).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Sing a “new song” of praise to Jesus</u>.  The psalmist urged Yahweh’s people to “Sing <em>a new song</em> to the LORD.”  (Ps. 149:1a).  Similar declarations appear throughout the Bible:  “Sing to Him a <em>new song</em>; play skillfully with a shout of joy.”  (Ps. 33:3).  “He put a<em> new song</em> in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; many will see and fear and will trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” (Ps.  40:3). “<em>Sing to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> a new song;</em>”  (Ps. 96:1).  “Sing a <em>new song</em> to the LORD, for He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.”  (Ps. 98:1).  “I will sing a <em>new song</em> to You, O God; …” (Ps. 144:9). “Sing to the LORD a <em>new song</em>,  . . .”  (Is. 42:10).  “And they sang a <em>new song</em>, . . .”  (Rev. 5:9a).  “And <em>they sang a new song before the throne</em> and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to learn the song except the 144,000 who had been purchased from the earth.” (Rev. 14:3). This reflected the new beginning that Yahweh offered Israel. Their praise was therefore not meant to be stagnant. Their praise was meant to reflect their gratitude for their new deliverance and their second chance.</p></li>

<p>Sing new songs of praise for the new beginnings that Jesus offers you<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God promised that He would cleanse Israel, and He would recreate it with a “new heart”</u> . To encourage the Jews during their captivity, Jeremiah promised the Jews that God would recreate Israel: “For behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’ The LORD says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take possession of it.’” (Jer. 30:3). Ezekiel also promised that God would recreate Israel. But God would also transform Israel and give it a “new heart,” a foreshadow of the Holy Spirit: “For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the lands; and I will bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, <em>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you</em>; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in My statutes, and are careful and follow My ordinances.” (Ezek. 36:24-26). God’s promise of a “new heart” merited a “new song” of praise from Israel.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has also blessed His believers by making them “new creations”</u>.  If you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you can also give thanks that He has made a new creation out of you:  “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a <em>new creature</em>; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.”  (2 Cor. 5:17).  “Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.”  (Ro. 6:4).  But you must actively work to make sure that you do not corrupt what Jesus created:  “and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.”  (Eph. 4:24).  Are you praising Jesus for His new work in you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <u>Sanctification: Praise Jesus for Offering All The Chance to be Sanctified and For Making the Church His Bride</u>. Ps. 149:1b.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Offer Jesus praise with others for the sanctification that He offers you and His Church</u>. The psalmist urged Yahweh’s “godly ones” to come together and offer collective praise for Him. “<strong><sup>1b</sup></strong> <em>…and His praise in the congregation of the godly ones</em>.” (Ps. 149:1b). “It is wonderful for the individual saint to offer praise to God; it is even better and greater to do so <strong>in the assembly of saints</strong>. The community of God’s people makes praise all the richer, especially praise offered in <strong>song</strong>.” (David Guzik on Ps. 149:1b).<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus collectively with other believers for your redemption</u>. The psalmist urged believers to praise Yahweh <em>in the congregation</em>.” (Ps. 149:1b). Other psalmists also urged believers to praise God with other believers. “I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise You.” (Ps. 22:22). “Bless God in the congregations, even the LORD, you who are of the fountain of Israel.” (Ps. 68:26). “The heavens will praise Your wonders, LORD; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.” (Ps. 89:5). This psalm also foreshadows unified praise for Jesus in heaven. “After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, ‘Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,”’ (Rev. 19:1).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for sanctifying you to be part of the Church He will marry in heaven</u>. The psalmist urged the “<em>the godly ones</em>” to praise Yahweh (Ps. 149:1b). Through faith in Jesus, you become righteous: “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor. 5:21; Ro. 3:22; Gal. 2:16). Having been made righteous, you will become one with Jesus as part of His congregation in heaven. “It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Then he said to me, ‘Write: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.’ And he said to me, ‘These are the true words of God.”’ (Rev. 19:8-9). Again, He is worthy of your praise.</p></li>

<h2 id="joy-praise-jesus-for-the-joy-of-his-redemption-as-your-king.-ps.-1492-3."><strong>3. <u>Joy: Praise Jesus for the Joy of His Redemption as Your King</u>. Ps. 149:2-3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for the joy He offers as both Creator and King of Kings for His Redemption</u>. Because Yahweh had created Israel and faithfully redeemed it from its many enemies, the psalmist urged the Jews to offer Him joyful praise with singing and dancing. “<strong><sup>2<em> </em></sup></strong><em>Israel shall be joyful in his Maker; the sons of Zion shall rejoice in their King. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>They shall praise His name with dancing; they shall sing praises to Him with tambourine and lyre</em>.” (Ps. 149:2-3). “Here is that new creation which calls for the new song. It was Jehovah who made Israel to be Israel, and the tribes to become a great nation: therefore let the Founder of the nation be had in perpetual honor.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 149:2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who put their faith in Jesus will be blessed</u>.  David wrote many psalms to sing of his joy that came when he took refuge in God:  “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever!  And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.”  (Ps. 5:11).  “For the music director.  A Psalm of David.  In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee as a bird to your mountain?”’  (Ps. 11:1). “Taste and see that the LORD is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!”  (Ps. 34:8).  Solomon also promised blessings for those who put their faith in God: “One who pays attention to the word will find good, and blessed is one who trusts in the LORD.”  (Prov. 16:20).  Jeremiah also promised for those who put their faith in God: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD.”  (Jer. 17:7). </p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also offers eternal joy in heaven</u>.  David also urged believers to rejoice in their redemption. “Serve the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with reverence and rejoice with trembling.” (Ps. 2:11). “So that I may tell of all Your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.”  (Ps. 9:14).  “But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.”  (Ps. 13:5).  “So my soul shall rejoice in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation.”  (Ps. 35:9).  In heaven, believers will enjoy an eternity of great rejoicing:  “Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,”  (Rev. 5:11).  This is yet another reason for you to praise Jesus.</p></li>

Ps. 149:4.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for offering out of love a path to find salvation</u>. The psalmist urged praise for Yahweh because He loves His people and provided a means to save them when they could not save themselves. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will glorify the lowly with salvation.”</em> (Ps. 149:4). “For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people - Let them rejoice on this account. He loves them; he approves their conduct; he bestows his favors upon them. All this should add to their joy, and fill their hearts with gladness …He will beautify the meek with salvation - The word here rendered beautify means to adorn, to honor, as the sanctuary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a> (rendered glorify); and it here means that the salvation which God would bestow upon them would be of the nature of an ornament, as if they were clothed with costly or splendid raiment. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-16.htm">Psalm 132:16</a>. The word meek here means humble or lowly, and may refer to those who are humble in rank or condition, or those who are humble in heart. Perhaps the two ideas are here combined. They have not external adorning, but God will give them an honor and beauty in salvation which no outward adorning could impart.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 149:4).<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Praise Jesus for the sacrifice that He made out of love to make salvation possible<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers salvation to the humble</u>. The psalmist stated that Yahweh will offer “<em>the lowly</em>” “<em>salvation.”</em> (Ps. 149:4). Jesus offers grace to those with the humility to recognize that they cannot find salvation without Him (Jam. 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:5). David and other psalmists repeatedly praised Yahweh for the salvation that He alone offers. “<em>Salvation belongs to the LORD;</em> may Your blessing be upon Your people! Selah” (Ps. 3:8). “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be <em>the God of my salvation</em>, . . . He gives <em>great salvation</em> to His king, and shows faithfulness to His anointed, to David and his descendants forever.” (Ps. 18:46, 50). “<em>Lord, in Your strength the king will be glad, and in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!</em>” (Ps. 21:1).  “The LORD … He is a refuge of <em>salvation to His anointed</em>.” (Ps. 28:8). “But the <em>salvation</em> of the righteous is from the LORD;...” (Ps. 37:39). “GOD the Lord, <em>the strength of my salvation</em>,...” (Ps. 140:7). Job also professed faith in his Redeemer: “Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.” (Job 19:25). Your redemption is only possible through faith in God: “I, only I, am the LORD, and <em>there is no savior besides Me</em>.” (Is. 43:11). Many Jews understood this to mean a physical salvation. Jesus came and expanded the meaning of this to also include the spiritual salvation of your soul for all eternity. He is again worthy of your praise.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, Jesus was crucified so that everyone might find eternal life</u>.  The psalmist also stated that “<em>the Lord takes pleasure in His people;</em>” (Ps. 149:4). Jesus died on the cross and rose again to allow all who believe in Him to have eternal life:  “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”  (Jo. 3:16).  “Jesus said to her, ‘I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,’”  (Jo. 11:25-26; 14:19). What Jesus offers is a “free” gift that only requires faith in Him:  “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is <em>eternal life</em> in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  (Ro. 6:23). When believers get to heaven, they will sing out with joy for Jesus’ love for them.</p></li>

<h2 id="peace-praise-jesus-for-the-peace-he-offers-during-any-conflict.-ps.-1495."><strong>5. <u>Peace: Praise Jesus For the Peace He Offers During Any Conflict</u>. Ps. 149:5.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for allowing you to be able to find peace and rest in Him during any trial</u>. The psalmist further urged praise because Yahweh provides a means for His people to find peace and rest in the midst of their struggles. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The godly ones shall be jubilant in glory; they shall sing for joy on their beds</em>.” (Ps. 149:5). “Are they lying down at night in restful peace? Are they maybe ‘reclining at a festal meal ... especially if the theme of such a festival was the final victory of God’ (Kidner, Psalms 73-159, TOTC, 489). Either is possible and both would be true. In God’s final victory the Prince of Peace will reign (Isa. 9:6-7; Ps 110:4-7). The people of God will enjoy perfect and eternal Shalom. The victory celebration will be the climax of history. The rest enjoyed by the people of God under King Jesus will be forever! Hallelujah!” (Danny Akin on Ps. 149).<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>When others attack you, find peace in Jesus</u>. The struggles that the Jews experienced correspond with the struggles that all believers experience in the world. When you encounter conflict, Jesus offers you His peace if you turn to Him in faith. “<em>Peace I leave you, My peace I give you</em>; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.” (Jo. 14:27). “These things I have spoken to you so that <em>in Me you may have peace</em>. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). “And all who will follow this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.” (Gal. 6:16). “For <em>He Himself is our peace</em>, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Eph. 2:14). “Peace be to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 6:23). “The LORD lift up His face to you, and give you peace.” (Nu. 6:26). “The LORD will give strength to His people; the LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11). “Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, mend your ways, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (2 Chr. 13:11). Thus, if you need peace, turn to Jesus.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God also gives believers the ability to find rest during a trial</u>.  The ability to sing praises in bed also speaks to the ability to find rest during a conflict (Ps. 149:5). Even when he faced an army that was trying to kill him, God blessed David with peace and rest: “I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sustains me.”  (Ps. 3:5).  He also offers you peace. “When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.” (Prov. 3:24).  “In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You alone, LORD, have me dwell in safety.”  (Ps. 4:8).  “Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; my flesh also will dwell securely.”  (Ps. 16:9).  “You shall therefore follow My statutes and keep My judgments so as to carry them out, so that you may live securely on the land.”  (Lev. 25:18).  “When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security,”  (Dt. 12:10).  This psalm therefore suggests that believers during the end times will be able to find rest in the midst of the struggles that they will encounter when evil reaches its culmination. If you are stressed out and unable to sleep, you can also turn to Jesus and pray for Him to restore your ability to sleep.</p></li>

<h2 id="justice-praise-jesus-because-he-is-a-fair-and-just-judge.-ps.-1496-9a."><strong>6. <u>Justice: Praise Jesus Because He is a Fair and Just Judge</u>. Ps. 149:6-9a.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus because He will judge evil in His perfect timing</u>. The psalmist thanked God because He allowed Israel to be the instrument of His judgment against God’s enemies. “<em><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The high praises of God shall be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands, <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishment on the peoples, <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>to bind their kings with chains, and their dignitaries with shackles of iron, <strong><sup>9a </sup></strong>to execute against them the judgment written</em>.” (Ps. 149:6-9a). “This psalm calls the people of Israel to praise God with their mouths while holding a double-edged sword in their hands with which to inflict God's vengeance on enemy nations and their kings. Should we just understand this psalm within an Old Testament historical context, or should we also attribute it to a future end-time context? In Old Testament times, God called the people of Israel to act as agents of his judgment against enemy nations (e.g. Deuteronomy 20:17). In the New Testament, Jesus proclaimed the 'year of the Lord’s favour' (Luke 4:19, Isaiah 61:2), meaning that today we live in a time of God’s amnesty. Sinners can repent and turn themselves in to receive a no-quibble guarantee of God’s forgiveness. So in this present age, God’s people are commissioned with the Gospel to be agents of God’s mercy and love, not of his judgment. At the second coming, the amnesty will come to an end when Jesus proclaims the 'day of vengeance of our God' (Isaiah 61:2). At that time, will Jesus execute his judgments alone, or will his people receive a commission to participate with him? Psalm 118:10-13 seems to describe the people of Israel fighting alongside Jesus for the defense of Israel under enemy attack. Also, several passages seem to indicate that Jesus will muster an army of believers, possibly of resurrected and raptured believers, at his second coming (search Tags: Jesus musters an army).” (Paul Macisker on Ps. 149).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ Word will bring judgment</u>. The psalmist stated that “<em>praises of God shall be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword</em>.” (Ps. 149:6). God’s Word is sharper than a two-edged sword. “For the word of God is living and active, and <em>sharper than any two-edged sword</em>, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Heb. 4:12). During Armageddon, Jesus’ Word of judgment will defeat those who refuse to repent. “<em>From His mouth comes a sharp sword</em>, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.” (Rev. 19:15). “The psalmist explains why God’s people have taken up the sword in verses 7-9. He seems to envision the apocalyptic conflict between God and his enemies as waged by the people of God, who arise to do God’s vengeance on the nations, visiting his rebukes on the peoples in verse 7. The Ps 2 kings of the earth in rebellion against Yahweh and his messiah meet their just consequences in verse 8. God’s people bind the kings in fetters and shackle the world’s glorious ones in iron. This visits upon them, in words of verse 9, ‘the judgment written.’ The prescribed justice for God’s enemies could refer back to the warning of Ps. 2, or further back still to the Pentateuchal statements of God’s standards regarding right and wrong and what would happen to Israel’s unrepentant enemies.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 149:7-9).<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus also promises to judge those who rebel against Him</u>.  The Psalms are also filled with warnings of judgment against the rulers who rebel against God: “You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.’”  (Ps. 2:9).  “The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath.”  (Ps. 110:5).  Samuel also foretold of God’s judgment upon the nations:  “Those who contend with the LORD will be terrified; against them He will thunder in the heavens, the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed.”  (1 Sam. 2:10).  God the Father has given Jesus full authority to judge evil: “For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.” (Jo. 5:22). Jesus will one day shatter the nations who oppose Him:  “For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works” (Matt. 16:27). “For He repays a person for his work, and lets things happen in correspondence to a man’s behavior.” (Job 34:11; Ro. 2:6). “And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the Potter are shattered, as I also have received authority from My Father;”  (Rev. 2:27). This warning exists so that none will be without excuse if they refuse to repent. Everyone must repent and accept Jesus. </p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ perfect justice includes mercy</u>. Some are troubled by God’s judgment. But God would not be “just” if He ignored evil. God also gives us these prophecies to warn everyone. He does not want any to perish: “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9). As a just and loving God, Jesus’ perfect justice also includes mercy: “A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; to You, LORD, I will sing praises.” (Ps. 101:1). Anyone who repents and confesses Jesus as Lord and Savior will be forgiven (Jo. 3:16). Are you spreading the good news (Matt. 28:16-20)?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Jesus is the King of Kings (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 1:5; 17:14; 19:16). He sits on an eternal throne (Rev. 3:21). He will also rule as the Prince of Peace with justice and righteousness:  “For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.  There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore.”  (Is. 9:6-7; 16:5).  ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  The end to all injustice and evil is another reason to praise and worship Him.</p></li>

<h2 id="honor-praise-jesus-for-the-honors-he-graciously-offers-you.-ps.-1499b."><strong>7. <u>Honor: Praise Jesus for The Honors He Graciously Offers You</u>. Ps. 149:9b.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for the honors He offers out of grace to His believers</u>. Finally, the psalmist praised Yahweh for the honors that He offers to His people. “<strong><sup>9b</sup></strong> <em>This is an honor for all His godly ones. Praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!</em>” (Ps. 149:9b). “The final line announces that this ‘is an honor for all the beloved.’ The psalm has already announced that the LORD delights in honoring his people with saving victory; and now it concludes that the final victory is an honor (now <span dir="rtl">הָדָ֣ר</span>; s.v., Ps. 96:6). The final victory will be the most spectacular glory for the beloved people of God … [T]he primary view of the psalm is eschatological: it is a hymn of praise for the retribution that will overtake the enemies of God. And that victory will be a war that will be used by God to vindicate his people through judgment on the wicked. The psalm calls for praise in anticipation of God’s crowning glory for his people, ultimate victory in the LORD.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 149:9).<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of grace, Jesus offers rewards for His people in heaven</u>. The psalmist promised that Yahweh’s “<em>godly ones</em>” will receive “<em>honor</em>” (Ps. 149:9b). Out of grace, Jesus will honor believers (His godly ones). “The one who overcomes, and the one who keeps My deeds until the end, I will give him authority over the nations;” (Rev. 2:26). “The one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.” (Rev. 3:21). He is again worthy of your praise.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will also reward your faith on Earth and in heaven</u>.  In addition to the reward of eternal life, Jesus also promises to bless you in many other ways.  He promises to bless you with the Holy Spirit as a down-payment on your salvation (Eph. 1:14; 2 Cor. 1:22). And, in addition to blessings on Earth through the Spirit, He promises five kinds of crowns in heaven.  <em>First</em>, those who persevere in the face of trials will receive a crown of life: “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive <em>the crown of life</em> which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.”  (Ja. 1:12; ; Rev. 2:10).  <em>Second</em>, those who live a pure life while waiting for His return will receive a crown of righteousness: “in the future there is laid up for me the <em>crown of righteousness</em>, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.”  (2 Tim. 4:8).  <em>Third</em>, those who exercise self-control will receive an “<em>incorruptible crown</em>”  (1 Cor. 9:25-27). <em>Fourth</em>, elders, pastors, teachers, leaders, and shepherds of God’s flock will also receive “<em>a crown of glory</em>”  (1 Pet. 5:4).  <em>Finally</em>, those who help lead others to Christ will receive a “<em>crown of rejoicing</em>”  (1 Thess. 2:19; ).  Jesus also promised various conditional blessings in the beatitudes (Matt. 5:1-12).  He also promised “rewards” for those who store up their treasures in heaven  (Matt. 6:20).  These are among the examples of blessings that are unrelated to your salvation.  Other kinds of rewards on Earth include a prolonged life (Dt. 5:32-33).  Paul urged believers to thank Jesus for His indescribable gift:  “Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!” (2 Cor. 9:15).  Jesus is again worthy of your praise. Have you given thanks for your many undeserved rewards?</p></li>
