<p><u>Introduction</u>: Proverbs 21 continues Solomon’s lessons regarding the conduct that Yahweh’s people should follow. Yahweh, the great I AM, is another name for Jesus (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). Here, the Bible reveals several things that Jesus desires from you. These include: (1) submission (2) righteous conduct, (3) love, (4) restraint, (5) faith, (6) seeking wisdom, and (7) fearing Him.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses one and two, Solomon describes how Yahweh is sovereign over every person’s heart. Jesus is sovereign, and He desires that you submit to His will. <u>Second</u>, in verses three through eight, Solomon provides lessons in righteousness for believers to follow. Faith in Jesus makes you righteous. But He desires that you sanctify yourself by seeking to live according to His righteous example. <u>Third</u>, in verses nine through 15, Solomon gives examples regarding how a believer’s relationships should be guided through a godly love. Jesus also desires that love motivates your relationship with Him and others. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 16 and 17, Solomon reveals that believers should restrain their instincts and instead follow Yahweh’s path. Jesus also desires that you restrain your flesh and allow the Holy Spirit to guide you. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 18 through 21, Solomon gives examples regarding how faith should guide a believer’s conduct. Faith should also guide your obedience to Jesus. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 20 through 23, Solomon describes how believers should constantly seek out and follow Yahweh’s wisdom. To grow in your walk and to allow the Holy Spirit to guide you, Jesus also desires that you constantly seek out the wisdom that He offers. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 24 through 31, Solomon returns to the theme of the book by giving examples regarding how believers’ fear of the Lord should guide their conduct. Jesus also wants you to fear Him. He defines this as hating evil (Prov. 8:13).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has the ability to control a leader’s actions</u>. Jesus can change a leader’s thoughts and actions when needed to fulfill His greater plans. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He pleases</em>.” (Prov. 21:1). “As the cultivator directs the stream into the channels where it is most wanted, so Yahweh directs the thoughts of the true king, that his favors may fall, not at random, but in harmony with a divine order.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 21:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is sovereign over everyone</u>. Leaders have free will. But their authority to rule comes from Jesus, and He controls their decisions when it is part of His greater plans. “ … For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.” (Ro. 13:1b; 8:28). “By me kings reign, and … By me princes rule, and nobles, all who judge rightly.” (Prov. 8:15-16). “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things which have not been done, saying, ‘My plan will be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure’;” (Is. 46:10). “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23). “It is He who changes the times and the periods; He removes kings and appoints kings; He gives wisdom to wise men, and knowledge to people of understanding.” (Dan. 2:21). “For not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert comes exaltation; but God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.” (Ps. 75:6-7).</p></li>

<p>Submit to Jesus and allow Him to guide your actions for His glory<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus knows the motives behind your actions</u>. Because Jesus is sovereign and omnipotent, He examines every person’s true motives. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>Every person’s way is right in his own eyes, but the Lord examines the hearts</em>.” (Prov. 21:2). “God is also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>, called a trier, <span dir="rtl">בּחן</span>, of hearts, as He is here called a weigher, <span dir="rtl">תּכן</span>. The proverb indirectly admonishes us of the duty of constant self-examination, according to the objective norm of the revealed will of God, and warns us against the self-complacency of the fool,” (Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament, Prov. 21:2).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus examines your heart to correct your motives</u>. Because the heart is deceitful, Jesus examines your motives. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>All the ways of a person are clean in his own sight, but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> examines the motives.” (Prov. 16:2). “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10). “But the LORD said to Samuel, ‘Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”’ (1 Sam. 16:7). “And He said to them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but God knows your hearts; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God.”’ (Lk. 16:15). “that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things.” (1 Jo. 3:20). Because the heart is deceitful, every person should welcome Jesus’ examination and correction. “Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test and know my anxious thoughts; and see if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.” (Ps. 139:23-24).</p></li>

<h2 id="righteousness-faith-in-jesus-makes-you-righteous-and-he-desires-that-you-respond-by-following-his-righteous-example.-prov.-213-8."><strong>3. <u>Righteousness: Faith in Jesus Makes You Righteous, and He Desires That You Respond by Following His Righteous Example</u>. Prov. 21:3-8.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Your outward acts of piety are meaningless without righteousness and justice</u>. Jesus desires that you live out faith through righteousness and justice. This means far more to Him than outward acts of piety. “<sup>3 </sup><em>To do righteousness and justice is preferred by the Lord more than sacrifice</em>.” (Prov. 21:3). “Here, 1. It is implied that many deceive themselves with a conceit that, if they offer sacrifice, that will excuse them from doing justice, and procure them a dispensation for their unrighteousness; and this makes their way <em>seem right,</em> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage?q=Pr+21:2&amp;t=niv"><em>v.</em> 2</a>. <em>We have fasted,</em> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage?q=Isa+58:3&amp;t=niv">Isa 58 3</a>. <em>I have peace-offerings with me,</em> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage?q=Pr+7:14&amp;t=niv">Prov 7 14</a>. 2. It is plainly declared that living a good life (doing justly and loving mercy) is more pleasing to God than the most pompous and expensive instances of devotion. Sacrifices were of divine institution, and were acceptable to God if they were offered in faith and with repentance, otherwise not, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage?q=Isa+1:11&amp;t=niv">Isa 1 11</a>, etc.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 21:3).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus desires that you obey Him through acts of faith, mercy, justice, and compassion</u>. Jesus desires obedience over sacrifice. “Samuel said, “Does the LORD have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than a sacrifice, and to pay attention is better than the fat of rams.” (1 Sam. 15:22). This includes justice, kindness, and humility. “He has told you, mortal one, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8). This also includes loyalty. “For I desire loyalty rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.” (Hosea 6:6). “Now go and learn what this means: ‘I desire compassion, rather than sacrifice,’ for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” (Matt. 9:13; 12:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be humble in your walk with Jesus</u>. Another part of obeying Jesus’ desire for you is to be humble and avoid being prideful. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin</em>.” (Prov. 21:4). “The former is a sign of the latter, and commonly go together, and are both abominable to the Lord; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm"><u>Psalm 101:5</u></a>. A man that looks above others, and with disdain upon them, shows that pride reigns in him, and swells his mind with a vain opinion of himself; this may be observed in every self-righteous man; the parable of the Pharisee and publican is a comment upon it; sometimes there may be a proud heart under a disguise of humility; but the pride of the heart is often discovered by the look of the eyes.” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 21:4).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will humble the prideful</u>. Pride is one of the things that God “hates” (Prov. 6:16-17). Thus, God frequently condemns pride. “When pride comes, then comes dishonor; but with the humble there is wisdom.” (Prov. 11:2). “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; be assured, he will not go unpunished …Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:5,18). “Before destruction the heart of a person is haughty, but humility goes before honor.” (Prov. 18:12). “For the LORD is exalted, yet He looks after the lowly, but He knows the haughty from afar.” (Ps. 138:6). God will judge those who exalt themselves. “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12; Lk. 14:11). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ … Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.” (Jam. 4:6, 10). If you depend upon your intellect, your experiences, or your own wisdom, you suffer from the sin of pride.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless those who diligently labor for Him</u>. To obey Jesus’ calling in your life, He wants you to diligently and faithfully labor for Him, His Church, and others wherever He places you. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The plans of the diligent certainly lead to advantage, but everyone who is in a hurry certainly comes to poverty</em>.” (Prov. 21:5). “When good planning is combined with <strong>diligent</strong> work there will be a harvest of <strong>plenty</strong> … The one who wants to avoid work, find shortcuts, and cut corners will find failure instead of <strong>plenty</strong>. Their path leads <strong>surely to poverty</strong>.” (David Guzik, Enduring Word on Prov. 21:5).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The righteous who labor hard for Jesus will lack no good thing</u>. In other proverbs, Solomon observes: “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>In all labor there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.” (Prov. 14:23). “One who works his land will have plenty of food, but one who follows empty pursuits will have plenty of poverty.” (Prov. 28:19). But these promises must be read in the full context of Scripture. Jesus provides for those who diligently labor for Him. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). Those who sow greatly for Jesus will also reap greatly from His blessings, even though they may be spiritual (2 Cor. 9:6; Eph. 2:10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to labor for Him with integrity</u>. Fraud is an abomination to Jesus. Thus, believers must show integrity in the pursuit of wealth. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor, the pursuit of death</em>.” (Prov. 21:6). “Since the world is a corrupt place (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Peter/1/2-Peter-1-4.html">2 Peter 1:4</a>), it’s possible to gain temporary wealth through dishonest means. But those who ignore God's goodness and seek money, instead, are headed for terrible disaster (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/15/Proverbs-15-27.html">Proverbs 15:27</a>). That consequence often comes in this life, either by legal ramifications or revenge from those who've been cheated. But it will certainly come in eternity; God judges those who reject Him in favor of wealth (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-2.html">Proverbs 10:2</a>). One way or another, sin leads to destruction (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/21/Proverbs-21-7.html">Proverbs 21:7</a>).” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 21:6).<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who obtain wealth through unethical means face discipline or judgment</u>. The love of money sadly induces some to pursue wealth through unethical means. “But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” (1 Tim. 6:9-10). Theft violates the Eighth Commandment (Ex. 20:15; Dt. 5:19). Thus, those who steal or defraud others and fail to repent face Jesus’ discipline or judgment. “A faithful person will abound with blessings, but one who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished.” (Prov. 28:20). “For what good will it do a person if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a person give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:26; Mk. 8:36-37; Lk. 9:25). The consequences of unethical business practices can also extend to a sinner’s entire family. “He who profits illicitly troubles his own house, but he who hates bribes will live.” (Prov. 15:27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will impose justice upon those who act with injustice</u>. Those who willfully refuse to obey God’s standards of righteousness and repent will face His judgment. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to act with justice</em>.” (Prov. 21:7). “[T]he injury which they do to others shall either by God or men be returned upon their own heads. They refuse to do judgment; they willfully and obstinately give up themselves to unrighteous practices.” (Matthew Poole’s Commentary on Prov. 21:7).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who practice injustice will reap what they sow</u>. For the unsaved, they will one day face judgment for their evil actions. “Be assured, the evil person will not go unpunished, but the descendants of the righteous will be rescued.” (Prov. 11:21). “For evildoers will be eliminated, but those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land.” (Ps. 37:9). “Woe to the wicked! It will go badly for him, for what he deserves will be done to him.” (Is. 3:11). “For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and will then repay every person according to his deeds.” (Matt. 16:27). “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:7-8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wicked openly act out their evil desires</u>. Every person has sinful thoughts and will on occasion act upon them (Rom. 3:10-12). But those with no fear of God act upon their evil desires without restraint. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The way of a guilty person is crooked, but as for the pure, his conduct is upright</em>.” (Prov. 21:8). “An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him … God allows the wicked to punish themselves by falling into mischief. As for the pure, his work is right; or, straight (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>). The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God’s law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 21:8).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>You will know the righteous in Christ Jesus through their conduct</u>. The pathways and gate leading to heaven are narrow and run through Jesus (Matt. 7:13-14; Lk. 13:24; Jo. 10:9; 14:6; Is. 35:8). You will also know which path a person is on by the fruit of their conduct. “You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.” (Matt. 7:16-17; 12; 33; Lk. 6:43-44; Jo. 15:4-5; Jam. 3:12).</p></li>

Prov. 21:9-15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Pursue love and harmony in your relationships</u>. In your marriage and in all your relationships, you should always try to avoid strife and attempt to live in love and harmony. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>It is better to live on a corner of a roof than in a house shared with a contentious woman</em>.” (Prov. 21:9). “This verse from Proverbs gives us a striking image of two contrasting living situations: one where peace reigns even in a small space, and the other where chaos reigns even in a large space. We see the advice urging us to choose our environment wisely. The key takeaway is straightforward – a peaceful and quiet existence is far more valuable than living in luxurious conditions filled with arguments and discontent. Why would one prefer to stay in a corner alone rather than live with turmoil? It highlights that peace is something we must cherish and work towards, not just in our homes, but also in our relationships.” (Christinanitypath.com on Prov. 21:9).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Live in love and harmony with one another<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Love your spouse and find harmony living together</u>. Other similar proverbs also condemn quarrelsome spouses. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>A foolish son is destruction to his father, and the quarrels of a wife are a constant dripping.” (Prov. 19:13). “It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and irritating woman.” (Prov. 21:19). “It is better to live on a corner of the roof, than in a house shared with a contentious woman.” (Prov. 25:24). “A constant dripping on a day of steady rain and a contentious woman are alike;” (Prov. 27:15). Spouses should submit to Jesus’ authority and love each other just as He loved the Church. “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,” (Eph. 5:25). This also includes being kind to each other. “Husbands, love your wives and do not become bitter against them.” (Col. 3:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wicked desire evil and have no love or compassion for others in need</u>. A person who openly embraces evil frequently has no godly love when others suffer or need the person’s assistance. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor is shown no compassion in his eyes</em>.” (Prov. 21:10). “This verse from the Bible highlights the destructive nature of sinful desires and the tendency for those who are wicked to crave evil without showing any mercy. It serves as a warning against giving in to harmful desires and urges, which can ultimately lead to ruin and devastation. The verse emphasizes the importance of resisting temptation and choosing to follow a path of righteousness and compassion instead.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 21:10).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A person who openly desires evil is an abomination to God</u>. A person who openly plots to obtain what God calls evil is among those things that He hates. “There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to Him:…A heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil,” (Prov. 6:16, 18). “For the wicked boasts of his soul’s desire, and the greedy person curses and shows disrespect to the LORD.” (Ps. 10:3). “Woe to those who devise wrongdoing, who practice evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, because it is in the power of their hands.” (Micah 2:1). People who refuse to repent of their evil desires eventually openly embrace the deeds of their flesh. “people having been filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, and evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice; they are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unfeeling, and unmerciful;” (Ro. 1:29-31).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who love God value discipline</u>. Without needing to be disciplined, a wise person will repent out of a love for God. Such a person also sees God’s love when disciplined as God restoring their walk. But a wicked person will only repent when they are caught, if at all. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>When the scoffer is punished, the naive becomes wise; but when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 21:11). “The simple must see justice enacted before he will learn the errors of sin, but a wise man will learn from the instruction of God’s word and turn from the ways of sin.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 21:11).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your love for Jesus by accepting His discipline</u>. Jesus wants you to become wise. If He is forced to discipline you, He wants your repentance to be genuine and motivated by your love for Him. “Strike a scoffer and the naive may become clever, but rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.” (Prov. 19:25). “One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself. Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight.” (Prov. 9:7-9; 23:9; Matt. 7:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who love Jesus learn from His warnings about sin</u>. A person who loves Jesus and seeks to draw closer to Him is deterred from giving into temptation by remembering the eventual judgment that unrepentant sinners bring upon themselves. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>The righteous one considers the house of the wicked, bringing the wicked to ruin</em>.” (Prov. 21:12). “<em>A Righteous one </em>(God) <em>marks the house of the wicked and overthroweth the wicked for</em> (their) <em>destruction.</em> He watches the evil to see whether they will repent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-8.htm"><u>Luke 13:8</u></a>), and if they will not, at last overthrows them when their iniquity has become full (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm"><u>Genesis 15:16</u></a>).” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 21:12).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who love Jesus seek to avoid disappointing Him</u>. Those who are wise do not need to wait to watch a sinner suffer from judgment. The wise read the Word and avoid what they know will one day lead to sorrow. “The way of the LORD is a stronghold for the upright, but ruin to the workers of injustice. The righteous will never be shaken, but the wicked will not live in the land.” (Prov. 10:29-30). “The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.” (Prov. 14:11). “For there will be no future for the evil person; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.” (Prov. 24:20). “Observe the blameless person, and look at the upright; for the person of peace will have a future. But wrongdoers will altogether be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be eliminated.” (Ps. 37:37-38). “When the wicked sprouted up like grass and all who did injustice flourished, it was only that they might be destroyed forevermore.” (Ps. 92:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who have no love or compassion may have their prayers hindered</u>. Those with cold hearts who ignore others who need help may find their cries to God are also ignored. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>One who shuts his ear to the outcry of the poor will also call out himself, and not be answered</em>.” (Prov. 21:13). “God watches out for the poor. Do not forget it (<a href="https://ref.ly/Deut%2015.7-11;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Deut 15:7-11</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps%2068.5;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Ps 68:5</u></a>). He sees when you ignore them; He sees when you help them. He will curse the one action and bless the other (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%2011.26;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 11:26</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2019.17;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>19:17</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2022.9;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>22:9</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2024.11-12;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>24:11-12</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2028.27;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>28:27</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2029.7;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>29:7</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Ps%2041.1-3;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Ps 41:1-3</u></a>). And so will men! They will return your lack of mercy back on you in your hour of need. It is your choice, but the consequences are terrible. Do not ignore a legitimate need, when you become aware of it.” (LetGodbeTrue on Prov. 21:13).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus may deny those who show no love to persons in need</u>. Jesus warns that sin can hinder your prayers (1 Pet. 3:7). Even worse, He may deny some who profess to know Him while simultaneously withholding help to persons in need. “Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’ Then they themselves also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or as a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?’ Then He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for Me, either.’” (Matt. 25:41-45).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Give gifts out of love and never for self-gain</u>. A gift given out of love is admirable. But a gift given as a secret bribe or to influence others reveals a selfish heart. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>A gift in secret subdues anger, and a bribe in an inside pocket, strong wrath</em>.” (Prov. 21:14). “The wicked’s callousness to the poor is escalated to their accepting a self-serving <em>gift</em> (or ‘bribe’; see 15:27; 17:8, 23; 18:16; 19:6; cf. Exod. 23:8). Whereas they can resist the indigent’s cry for justice, they cannot resist bribes. The bribe’s perversion of justice is symbolized by its being <em>given in secret</em>, taken because it <em>subdues anger</em>, the outward expression of <em>strong</em> inward <em>wrath</em> for a perceived wrong (cf. 6:35). Assuaging wrath through virtue is positive (cf. 15:1; 29:8), but pacifying it through a bribe, which perverts justice, is a vice.” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 21:14).<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Give gifts to honor others and resolve conflicts, not to influence others</u>. Giving a gift can help to bring reconciliation during a conflict. For example, Jacob sought to appease Esau’s anger at him with gifts (Gen. 32:20). Likewise, Abigail also brought gifts to appease David’s anger against Nabal (1 Sam. 25:27). Gifts can also be given to show friendship or respect. For example, the Queen of Sheba brought Solomon gifts to show him respect (1 Kgs. 10:1-2). The wise men brought gifts to Jesus at the time of His birth to honor Him (Matt. 2:11). A sinful woman also anointed Jesus’ feet with perfume to honor Him (Lk. 7:37-38). When you give to those in need with the right motives, your gifts will also be remembered and celebrated in heaven (Acts 10:4). But a gift should never be given to bribe or influence others for personal benefit. “You shall not distort justice, you shall not show partiality; and you shall not accept a bribe, because a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and distorts the words of the righteous.” (Deut. 16:19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your love for Jesus by practicing justice</u>. When you show a love for others trapped in unjust circumstances and seek to free them from injustice, you show your love for Jesus. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The exercise of justice is joy for the righteous, but terror to those who practice injustice</em>.” (Prov. 21:15). “The proverb emphasizes that for the righteous, seeing justice executed is a source of joy, as it affirms moral order and societal well-being. On the other hand, the wicked experience terror when justice is served, for it threatens their impunity and foreshadows their downfall. Additionally, this verse serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of iniquity. The passage highlights not just the love of justice among the righteous but also the destructive fate awaiting those who persist in wrongdoing. In a world where justice may seem delayed, this proverb reassures the faithful that righteousness ultimately leads to fulfillment, while the workers of iniquity are sowing seeds that will lead to their destruction, …” (TheBibleSays.com on Prov. 21:15).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p><u>Jesus reigns with justice and uses believers to help the oppressed</u>. Jesus will fulfill all the Bible’s promises and reign with perfect justice and one day bring judgment upon unrepentant evil. “You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of joy above Your companions.” (Ps. 45:7; Heb. 1:9). “Behold, a king will reign righteously, and officials will rule justly.” (Is. 32:1). “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD anointed me to bring good news to the humble; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to captives and freedom to prisoners;” (Is. 61:1; 9:6-7; Lk. 4:18-19). ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.’ In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will live securely; and this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The LORD Our Righteousness.’” (Jer. 23:5-6). But Jesus uses faithful and obedient believers to bring justice for the oppressed.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Restrain your desire to follow the popular path and cling to Jesus’ path</u>. When your heart is unguarded, the temptation exists to follow the path taken by others around you. But that path frequently leads only to sorrow. Jesus wants you to stay on His narrow path, even when it is unpopular. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>A person who wanders from the way of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead</em>.” (Prov. 21:16). “He who forsakes the way of wisdom, the path of virtue, the religious life, and thus becomes in proverbial language ‘a fool,’ … The denunciation means primarily that the sinner shall soon be with the shades of the dead, shall meet with a speedy death.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 21:16).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Failing to restrain your flesh and leaving Jesus’ narrow path leads to suffering<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ path leading to eternal life is narrow, and few find it</u>. Those who rely upon their own instincts inevitably stray from Jesus’ path. “There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 14:12). Jesus’ path leading to eternal life is narrow. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14; Lk. 13:24). “Leave them alone; they are blind guides of blind people. And if a person who is blind guides another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.” (Matt. 15:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Abstain from ungodly pleasures and intoxication</u>. Those who become drunk, high, or pursue other ungodly pleasures will quickly stray from Jesus’ narrow path. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>One who loves pleasure will become a poor person; one who loves wine and oil will not become rich</em>.” (Prov. 21:17). “Solomon (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-1.html">Proverbs 10:1</a>) warns that living for pleasure causes a person to become destitute … Obsession with pleasure—with pleasing oneself in the moment—is also a sign of spiritual weakness. <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/2-Timothy/3/2-Timothy-3-2.html">Second Timothy 3:2–4</a> warns about this as a symptom of a world moving away from God: ‘…people will be lovers of self…lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.’ …Wine and oil were used at feasts (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/104/Psalm-104-15.html">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/27/Proverbs-27-9.html">Proverbs 27:9</a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Amos/6/Amos-6-6.html">Amos 6:6</a>). The host and guests drank wine, and the oil meant here was a perfume poured over the head of an honored person. Hoarding such things, instead of investing them, would not be an effective use of resources. In another way, those who love luxuries (‘wine and oil’) such that they prioritize them will be more likely to waste their resources and become poor.” (BibleRef.com on Prov. 21:17).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The Prodigal son squandered his inheritance because he loved pleasure over work</u>. The Bible condemns those who pursue excessive pleasure. “You have lived for pleasure on the earth and lived luxuriously; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.” (Jam. 5:5). In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, the son squandered his quickly obtained inheritance because he had not worked for it, and he loved pleasure more than hard work and serving God. “And He said, ‘A man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that is coming to me.’ And <em>so</em> he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his estate in wild living. Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began doing without.” (Lk. 15:11-14). In the end times, Babylon will be condemned in part for its unholy luxuries. “To the extent that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, to the same extent give her torment and mourning; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as a queen and I am not a widow, and will never see mourning.’” (Rev. 18:7).</p></li>

<h2 id="faith-jesus-desire-that-faith-motivates-your-actions.-prov.-2118-21."><strong>5. <u>Faith: Jesus Desire That Faith Motivates Your Actions</u>. Prov. 21:18-21.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus became a ransom for our souls</u>. Jesus paid the price at the cross to allow believers to become righteous before God the Father. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the treacherous is in the place of the upright</em>.” (Prov. 21:18). “Justice demands the punishment of the guilty in order that the guiltless may be delivered; but, by the grace of God, Jesus Christ, the Righteous, become a ransom for the wicked. He is the ‘upright,’ and you and I are the ‘transgressors.’” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 21:18).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus for taking your sins at the cross and paying the price for your sins</u>. Just as the prophet Isaiah promised, Jesus the Messiah was pierced to take our sins upon Him and heal those who believe from their sorrows. “However, it was our sicknesses that He Himself bore, and our pains that He carried; yet we ourselves assumed that He had been afflicted, struck down by God, and humiliated. But He was pierced for our offenses, He was crushed for our wrongdoings; the punishment for our well-being was laid upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed.” (Is. 53:4-5; 1 Pet. 2:24). “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin in our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor. 5:21). “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written: Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree’—” (Gal. 3:13).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith without love is dead</u>. Jesus wants you to follow His wisdom by loving, supporting, and encouraging your family members, including your spouse. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and irritating woman</em>.” (Prov. 21:19). “The broader picture in this chapter encourages us to seek wisdom, justice, and righteousness in all our actions. The earlier verses address the importance of being mindful of our actions and their consequences. The message is clear: if we want to maintain joyful and peaceful homes, we must choose respect and understanding over discord. It teaches us that our personal well-being is directly linked to the quality of our relationships. Just as we choose whom to associate with, we must also choose to address the nature of our relationships to foster peace.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 21:19).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Love and support your spouse</u>. Other proverbs encourage spouses to honor each other. “An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who shames him is like rottenness in his bones.” (Prov. 12:4). “An excellent wife, who can find her? For her worth is far above jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not evil all the days of her life.” (Prov. 31:10-11). Spouses should submit to Jesus’ authority and love each other just as He loved the Church. “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,” (Eph. 5:25; 1 Pet. 3:1-2). This also includes being loving and kind to each other. “Love is patient, love is kind, ...” (1 Cor. 13:4; 1 Cor. 7:3-4).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Treat the wisdom that Jesus offers as your greatest treasure</u>. A person who is wise in Jesus’ eyes will carefully protect and guard the eternal wisdom that He offers. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>There is precious treasure and oil in the home of the wise, but a foolish person swallows it up</em>.” (Prov. 21:20). “This theme of prudence and stewardship is echoed throughout the Bible. For instance, in <a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/matthew/matthew_25_1-13/"><u>Matthew 25:1-13</u></a>, the Parable of the Ten Virgins underscores the importance of preparedness and wisdom. Similarly, Joseph’s foresight in <a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/genesis/genesis_41/"><u>Genesis 41</u></a>, saving Egypt from famine, exemplifies the benefits of prudent planning and resource management. These stories reiterate the message that wisdom not only preserves but also multiplies blessings.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 21:20).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who honor Jesus with their worldly treasures will have treasures in heaven</u>. Those who are wise enough to serve Jesus with what He provides will be rewarded in heaven. “Honor the LORD from your wealth, and from the first of all your produce; then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.” (Prov. 3:9-10). “Great wealth is in the house of the righteous, but trouble is in the income of the wicked.” (Prov. 15:6). “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wise pursue Jesus’ righteousness and find it</u>. If you have the faith to pursue Jesus’ wisdom and live it out, you will find life, righteousness, and honor in your relationships. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>One who pursues righteousness and loyalty finds life, righteousness, and honor</em>.” (Prov. 21:21). The word <span dir="rtl">וָחָ֑סֶד</span> (wā·ḥā·seḏ) is translated as “loyalty” in the NASB. But it is “mercy” in the KJB and NKJB, “love” in the NIV, “loving devotion” in the Berean Bible, and “kindness” in the English Standard Version. “The proverb asserts the general law of God’s moral government, that they who seek good things shall find more than they sought for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-11.htm">1 Kings 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>); the pursuit of ‘righteousness and mercy” will end in the acquisition of ‘life, righteousness and honor.’ But the proverb seems also to insist upon aiming at a perfect character in the pursuit of moral excellence. Not only should the sterner virtues, represented by <em>righteousness</em>, be cultivated, but their gentler fellows, which are summed up in ‘mercy.’ They who “hunger and thirst after righteousness” should also be “the merciful” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6-7</a>). So shall the reward attained be that which was sought for, <em>righteousness</em> (used here perhaps in its widest sense of moral perfection, including <em>mercy</em>, the ‘righteous man’ and the ‘good man’ being one and the same person, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm">Romans 5:7</a>), and with it in rich companionship <em>life and honour</em>, which were not objects of direct pursuit.” (Thomas Thomason Perowne, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Prov. 21:21) (italics in original).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Those with the wisdom to pursue Jesus’ righteousness will be blessed</u>. If you pursue Jesus’ righteousness, you will be satisfied and find His provision. “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.” (Matt. 5:6). “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). This is also the fruit of a saved person. “to those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life;” (Rom. 2:7). “But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.” (1 Tim. 6:11). “Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.” (2 Tim. 2:22). “And the work of righteousness will be peace, And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.” (Is. 21:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is mightier than any human power</u>. Even the greatest worldly powers are no match against Jesus’ wisdom. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>A wise person scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust</em>.” (Prov. 21:22). “Even in war, counsel does more than brute strength. So of the warfare which is carried on in the inner battlefield of the soul. There also wisdom is mighty to the ‘pulling down of strongholds’ (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-4.htm"><u>2 Corinthians 10:4</u></a>, where Paul uses the very words of the Septuagint Version of this passage), and the wise man scales and keeps the city which the strong man armed has seized and made his own.” (Albert Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Prov. 21:22).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom will allow you to bring down the enemy’s strongholds in your life</u>. Solomon later gave an example where Yahweh’s wisdom saved a city. “[T]here was a small city with few men in it, and a great king came to it, surrounded it, and constructed large siegeworks against it. But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he saved the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man. So I said, ‘Wisdom is better than strength.’ But the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are ignored.” (Ecc. 9:14-16). Jesus’ wisdom will frequently appear foolish to worldly people. “For the foolishness of God is wiser than mankind, and the weakness of God is stronger than mankind.” (1 Cor. 1:25). But obeying His wisdom can allow you to prevail in spiritual warfare and bring down the enemy’s spiritual strongholds in your life. “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage battle according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but <em>divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses</em>. We are destroying arguments and all arrogance raised against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Cor. 10:3-5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The wisdom of restraint that Jesus offers will also spare you from sorrow</u>. Those who follow Jesus’ wisdom will also protect themselves and their relationships from sorrow by restraining their mouths when they are offended. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>One who guards his mouth and his tongue, guards his soul from troubles</em>.” (Prov. 21:23). “By a constant watchfulness over our words we shall prevent abundance of mischiefs which an ungoverned tongue runs men into. Keep thy heart, and that will keep thy tongue from sin; keep thy tongue, and that will keep thy heart from trouble.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 21:23).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Because the flesh is weak, pray and wait before responding in difficult situations</u>. Solomon gave a similar warning to believers to guard their mouths. “One who guards his mouth protects his life; one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.” (Prov. 13:3). When believers are offended, they should restrain their desire to immediately respond. Failing to do so may harm others. “But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt. 12:36-37). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger, for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20). “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Prov. 18:21). “When there are many words, wrongdoing is unavoidable, but one who restrains his lips is wise.” (Prov. 10:19). “Do not be quick with your mouth or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of God. For God is in heaven and you are on the earth; therefore let your words be few.” (Ecc. 5:2).</p></li>

<li><p><u>The prideful, the arrogant, and scoffers all reject Jesus’ wisdom</u>. Pride, which goes by many names, will cause people to become spiritually blind to Jesus and reject His Word. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>‘Proud,’ ‘Arrogant,’ ‘Scoffer,’ are his names, one who acts with insolent pride</em>.” (Prov. 21:24). “What is a scorner? He is a defiant rebel that will not be corrected or instructed by others. In fact, he despises and hates anyone trying to reprove or teach him (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%209.7-8;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 9:7-8</u></a>) … What is a proud and haughty scorner? He is a defiant rebel that has extra arrogance and anger. These vile creatures mock their teachers, sneer at correction, and slander anyone that disagrees with them … What did Jesus Christ think of scorners? He said they did not deserve to hear His gospel. He called them dogs and pigs, and He told His disciples to keep the truth from them (<a href="https://ref.ly/Prov%203.34;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Pr 3:34</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2023.9;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>23:9</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Pr%2026.11;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>26:11</u></a>; <a href="https://ref.ly/Matt%207.6;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Matt 7:6</u></a>). He especially despised the scornful Pharisees for their religious pride. He told His disciples that God would root them out, and that they and their followers could fall into the ditch of heresy and judgment together (<a href="https://ref.ly/Matt%2015.12-14;kjv1900?t=biblia"><u>Matt 15:12-14</u></a>).” (LetGodbeTrue on Prov. 21:24).<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who show unrepentant pride towards Him</u>. Solomon promised that Yahweh will judge those who act with unrepentant pride. “Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; be assured, he will not go unpunished … Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.” (Prov. 16:5, 18). Jesus will one day come to fulfill these warnings and judge those who refuse to repent out of pride. “The proud look of humanity will be brought low, and the arrogance of people will be humbled; and the LORD alone will be exalted on that day. For the LORD of armies will have a day of reckoning against everyone who is arrogant and haughty, and against everyone who is lifted up, that he may be brought low.” (Isa. 2:11-12). “So I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their wrongdoing; I will also put an end to the audacity of the proud and humiliate the arrogance of the tyrants.” (Is. 13:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The unrepentant who are slothful with Jesus’ gifts also face judgement</u>. The slothful will also one day face judgment. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>The desire of the lazy one puts him to death, for his hands refuse to work</em>;” (Prov. 21:25). The craving for ease and rest, and the consequent disinclination for labor, prove fatal to the slothful man. Or, it may be, the mere wish, combined with no active exertion to secure its accomplishment, is fatal to soul, body, and fortune (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-4.htm"><u>Proverbs 13:4</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-24.htm"><u>Proverbs 19:24</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 21:25).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Work diligently for Jesus</u>. Solomon frequently warned against the sin of slothfulness. “Poor is one who works with a lazy hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who acts shamefully.” (Prov. 10:4-5). “The hand of the diligent will rule, but the lazy hand will be put to forced labor.” (Prov. 12:24). “The soul of the lazy one craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made prosperous.” (Prov. 13:4). “Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, and a lazy person will suffer hunger.” (Prov. 19:15). “The lazy one does not plow after the autumn, so he begs during the harvest and has nothing.” (Prov. 20:4). “Through extreme laziness the rafters sag, and through idleness the house leaks.” (Ecc. 10:18). Jesus has given every person gifts, and He warns of the sin of failing to use His gifts for His Kingdom. “But his master answered and said to him, ‘<em>You worthless, lazy slave</em>! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?’... For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 25:26, 29-30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus wants you to work diligently to serve Him, not yourself</u>. While some crave only to enrich themselves, those who are wise in Jesus’ eyes labor in pursuit of His Kingdom and those in need. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>All day long he is craving, while the righteous gives and does not hold back.”</em> (Prov. 21:26). “a. <strong>He covets greedily all day long</strong>: The reference is likely to the lazy man of the previous proverb. With his desire, that lazy man <strong>covets greedily</strong>, and he does it <strong>all day long</strong> – yet the desire is unfulfilled because he does not <em>work</em> towards it. b. <strong>The righteous gives and does not spare</strong>: The lazy man experiences constant disappointment, but the <strong>righteous</strong> man – who, by implication, works hard – he has so much that he <strong>gives and does not spare</strong>. He is so blessed that he has enough for himself and to give generously.” (David Guzik on Prov. 21:26) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your use of your money will show whether you have a heart for Jesus or the world</u>. If you crave money to enrich yourself and withhold from those in need, it shows a heart for this world and not for Jesus. “for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:21). “Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.” (1 Tim. 6:17-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will not accept worship or service that is offered with a selfish or evil motive</u>. Jesus cares nothing for worship or service that is offered as a ritual. Self-serving worship or worship that is offered with an evil heart is an abomination. “<strong><sup>27 </sup></strong><em>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, how much more when he brings it with evil intent!</em>” (Prov. 21:27). “In our lives, we might find ourselves engaging in activities that seem good on the surface, like helping others or attending church services. However, if we enter these situations with ulterior motives—be it to appear righteous, gain favor, or manipulate others—we are falling into the same category as the wicked person mentioned in Proverbs 21:27. Our inner thoughts and intentions matter just as much as our outward actions. God sees our hearts; He knows our thoughts before we even speak them. This leads us to reflect on what it means to be upright. To be upright is to be honest, sincere, and full of integrity. When we approach God from this state of being, our prayers and sacrifices become a source of delight to Him.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 21:27).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Repent of your sins and purify your heart before you approach Jesus</u>. God did not accept the Jews’ sacrifices when they were offered with the wrong motives or if they were offered as part of a mindless ritual (Is. 1:11-15; Amos 5:21-24). But God promised to judge the Jews when they offered sacrifices with evil motives (Prov. 21:27). “But the one who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a person; the one who sacrifices a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; one who offers a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood; one who burns incense is like one who blesses an idol. As they have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations, so I will choose their punishments and bring on them what they dread. Because I called, but no one answered; I spoke, but they did not listen. Instead, they did evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.” (Is. 66:3-4). When the Jews approached God with unrepentant sin or an evil heart, He warned that He would not hear their prayers (Prov. 28:9; Is. 59:2; Ps. 66:18; Micah 3:4; Jer. 11:14). Unrepentant sin can also hinder prayers (1 Pet. 3:7). Prayer offered with the wrong motives may also go unanswered (Jam. 4:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who perjury themselves or lie have no fear of God</u>. Persons who lie, deceive, or commit perjury deceive themselves if they believe that they are walking with Jesus. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>A false witness will perish, but a person who listens will speak forever</em>.” (Prov. 21:28). “A false witness shall perish, .... As witness he shall perish in his reputation, no credit shall be given him, he shall not be admitted an evidence, or a witness in any cause, being found a false one; and as a man, he shall be punished in body or estate by the civil magistrate, and his soul shall perish eternally, unless he has true repentance for his sin: or, a witness of lies shall perish … it may be applied to any teacher of false doctrine; and to the man of sin, and his followers, that speak lies in hypocrisy; everyone that loves and makes a lie shall die the second death, and be excluded from eternal happiness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm"><u>Revelation 21:8</u></a>;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 21:28).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Being a truthful witness is vital for God’s intended order for society</u>. Solomon gave a similar warning against perjury. “A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who declares lies will not escape.” (Prov. 19:5). Perjury is offensive to God, and it violates His Ninth Commandment. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.” (Ex. 20:16; Dt. 5:20). God will also severely punish those who commit perjury. “If a malicious witness rises up against a person to testify against him of wrongdoing, then both people who have the dispute shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who will be in office in those days. And the judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false witness and he has testified against his brother falsely, then you shall do to him just as he had planned to do to his brother. So you shall eliminate the evil from among you.” (Dt. 19:16-19; Ps. 101:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus knows the motives, and He will reward those who act with righteous intentions</u>. Jesus can see past the false exterior of a person who acts with a wicked intention. He will reward those who act with a pure heart. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>A wicked person displays a bold face, but as for the upright, he makes his way sure</em>.” (Prov. 21:29). “Proverbs 21:29 presents a stark juxtaposition between the behavior of the wicked and the righteous, shedding light on the moral and ethical distinctions between the two paths. The verse begins by highlighting how the wicked often put up a bold front, projecting an image of confidence and strength. However, beneath this facade lies a lack of genuine integrity and a sense of arrogance that ultimately leads to their downfall. On the other hand, the upright are characterized by their thoughtful consideration of their ways. This phrase emphasizes the reflective and conscientious nature of the righteous, who carefully ponder their actions and strive to align themselves with God’s will.” (Reverend Michael Johnson on Prov. 21:29).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who try to hide evil, but He will reward the righteous</u>. Jesus condemns those who brazenly display their evil when they come before Him. “The expression of their faces testifies against them, and they display their sin like Sodom; they do not even conceal it. Woe to them! For they have done evil to themselves.” (Is. 3:9). He also condemns those who display outward piety while secretly acting with evil motives. “Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?” (Matt. 7:15-16). In contrast, God is with those who attempt to follow His righteousness. “The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the criminal knows no shame.” (Zeph. 3:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who follow their own wisdom have no fear of Jesus</u>. The wisdom of the world is complete foolishness to Jesus. Those who follow popular opinion, worldly traditions, or their own instincts have no wisdom or understanding in His eyes. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>There is no wisdom, no understanding, and no plan against the Lord</em>.” (Prov. 21:30). “Try as we might, human beings cannot out-think God. Nor can we trick Him, overcome Him, or out-maneuver His will (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Job/42/Job-42-2.html"><u>Job 42:2</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/10/Proverbs-10-3.html"><u>Proverbs 10:3</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/146/Psalm-146-9.html"><u>Psalm 146:9</u></a>). It doesn't matter if the attempt is blatant when someone thinks they can hide their sin from God (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/10/Psalm-10-4.html"><u>Psalm 10:4</u></a>, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/10/Psalm-10-11.html"><u>11</u></a>). It doesn't matter if someone means well and yet thinks they can bargain with the Lord or force Him to act according to their wishes (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Deuteronomy/18/Deuteronomy-18-20.html"><u>Deuteronomy 18:20</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/2/Romans-2-4.html"><u>Romans 2:4</u></a>; <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Galatians/6/Galatians-6-7.html"><u>Galatians 6:7</u></a>). The Lord is absolutely sovereign (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-6.html"><u>Revelation 19:6</u></a>). <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/3/1-Corinthians-3-19.html"><u>First Corinthians 3:19–20</u></a> concurs with this proverb. Paul writes: ‘For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, ‘He catches the wise in their craftiness,’ and again, ‘The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”’ (BibleRef.com on Prov. 21:30).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus condemns those who fail to seek out and follow His wisdom</u>. Those who live according to their own instincts do not show the fruit of a transformed believer. They place themselves on a path leading to judgment. “Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight!” (Is. 5:21). “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a person who listens to advice is wise.” (Prov. 12:15). “Do you see a person wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.” (Prov. 26:12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Those who fail to give Jesus credit for their strength and victories do not fear Him</u>. Those who trust Jesus and fear Him know not to take credit for the strength, abilities, and victories. He deserves credit for every good and perfect thing in your life. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord</em>.” (Prov. 21:31). “The trusting soul rests on the fact that the counsel of the Lord will never be defeated. He fears not the plans and plots of his foes. What can they do to harm him? Nothing!!! The devil is ever ready to do battle against God’s children, but he cannot conquer the God of heaven and earth. Jehovah is His name.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 21:31).<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Place your trust in Jesus and not in your own strength</u>. In Old Testament times, horses and chariots were the most feared weapons of war. Thus, God used these examples to condemn those who placed their trust in their God-given strengths. “Some praise their chariots and some their horses, but we will praise the name of the LORD, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). “The king is not saved by a mighty army; a warrior is not rescued by great strength. A horse is a false hope for victory; nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength.” (Ps. 33:16-17; 1 Sam. 17:47; Is. 31:1; Hos. 1:7).</p></li>
