Kings 10: Lessons from Solomon On How to Properly Seek and Share God’s
Wisdom and Blessings</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter reveals both the height of Israel’s
material wealth and the beginnings of its spiritual decline. God blessed
Solomon with incredible wisdom and wealth. At first, he used his gifts
to serve others. Yet, he then used them to serve himself. From Solomon’s
example, God reveals seven lessons on how to seek and share His wisdom
and blessings.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, through Solomon, the queen of Sheba sought out God’s
wisdom. Like the queen of Sheba, God also wants you to seek His wisdom
when you are in need of guidance. <u>Second</u>, as he was led by the
Spirit, Solomon openly shared God’s wisdom with the queen of Sheba. Like
Solomon, God wants you to share His wisdom and truths with non-believers
and seekers. <u>Third</u>, the queen of Sheba responded to God’s wisdom
by praising God and offering God tribute. Like the queen of Sheba, God
wants you to praise Him for His truths and for His guidance.
<u>Fourth</u>, Solomon rewarded the queen of Sheba for seeking God’s
wisdom. Like Solomon, God also promises to reward you when you seek His
wisdom in faith. <u>Fifth</u>, God rewarded Solomon for serving Him.
Yet, Solomon used God’s wealth to honor himself. From Solomon’s error,
God warns that giving into coveting His blessing places you under
Satan’s influence. <u>Sixth</u>, even though Solomon misused God’s
blessing, other kings still paid great treasures to hear his God-given
wisdom. From this, God reveals that His wisdom is greater than any
earthly treasure. <u>Finally</u>, Solomon’s coveting caused him to
violate God’s law. This in turn caused him to later covet women and turn
his heart from God. Solomon later lamented that his coveting was waisted
vanity. From this, God warns that coveting violates His Word and also
leads to misery.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>The queen of Sheba tests the wisdom of God inside Solomon</u>.
After news of Solomon’s God-given wisdom spread throughout the Middle
East, the queen of Sheba came to test him with difficult questions:
“<sup>1</sup> <em>Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of
Solomon concerning the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
she came to test him with difficult questions. <sup>2 </sup>So she came
to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices and
very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke
with him about all that was in her heart</em>.” (1 Kgs. 10:1-2). Most
believe that the Kingdom of Sheba was located in modern day Yemen. This
establishes that Solomon’s fame for his God-given wisdom had spread
throughout the known world at that time.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Test all things</u>. Like the queen of Sheba, many people are
initially skeptical of God’s Word. Yet, God encourages seekers to test
what He says: “But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which
is good;” (1 Thess. 5:21). God’s Word is truth, and His truth will set
you free: “and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free. . . So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.” (Jo.
8:32, 36). If you have any doubt about God’s Word, test it and verify
for yourself that it is true.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is free when you ask for it</u>. God is also
ready to pour out His wisdom when you ask for it: “But if any of you
lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and
without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (Ja. 1:5). “Behold, You
desire truth in the innermost being, and in the hidden part You will
make me know wisdom.” (Ps. 51:6). If you are in need of guidance, are
you seeking His wisdom?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ wisdom, the wisest counsel anywhere</u>. Jesus
used this same account to lament that the people had someone wiser than
Solomon to advise them, but they refused to listen: “The Queen of the
South [Sheba] will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will
condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the
wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.”
(Matt. 12:42). Jesus wants you to listen to Him “in whom are hidden all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” (Col. 2:3). Are you seeking the
free wisdom that He offers you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God promises to bless those who hunger for His truth and
righteousness</u>. Like the queen of Sheba, if you diligently seek God’s
wisdom, you will also find it: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek,
and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who
asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be
opened.” (Matt. 7:7-8). “If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.” (Jo. 15:7).
“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
shall be satisfied.” (Matt. 5:6). “You will seek Me and find Me when you
search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13). “Delight yourself in
the LORD; and He will give you the desires of your heart.” (Ps. 37:4).
Do you hunger for God’s Word and the Holy Spirit to guide and direct
your steps?</p></li>

<u>Share God’s Wisdom and Truths with Non-Believers and Seekers</u>. 1
Kgs. 10:3-7.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon shares God’s wisdom with the queen of Sheba and
astonishes her</u>. With his God-given wisdom, Solomon exceeded the
queen of Sheba’s expectations by answering all of her difficult
questions: “<sup>3 </sup><em>Solomon answered all her questions; nothing
was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her.
<sup>4 </sup>When the queen of Sheba perceived all the wisdom of
Solomon, the house that he had built, <sup>5 </sup>the food of his
table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his waiters and
their attire, his cupbearers, and his stairway by which he went up to
the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, there was no more
spirit in her. <sup>6 </sup>Then she said to the king, ‘It was a true
report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
<sup>7 </sup>Nevertheless I did not believe the reports, until I came
and my eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. You
exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard</em>.’” (1 Kgs.
10:3-7). Because God gives His wisdom to you freely through Jesus, you
are also called upon to freely share it with others.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Share Jesus’ wisdom with others</u>. Jesus is the Word who
became flesh (Jo. 1:14). That means that you can share even greater
wisdom than Solomon merely by sharing the Word. Are you sharing the Word
as part of your Great Commission (Matt. 28:16-20)?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be God’s light for those who seek Him</u>. God called every
believer by name before the foundation of the world to do good works for
Him: “For we are His workmanship, <em>created in Christ Jesus for good
works</em>, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in
them.” (Eph. 2:10). “Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these
things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master,
<em>prepared for every good work</em>.” (2 Tim. 2:21). Like Solomon
here, one of the many types of “good works” that you are called upon to
do is to share the light of Jesus with others: “You are the light of the
world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;” (Matt. 6:14). You are
also to comfort or encourage others with the comfort you have received
from God (2 Cor. 1:4; Heb. 3:13). By your actions and words, are you a
light to others who are lost or suffering?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Teach the wisdom of Jesus’ Word to edify the Church</u>.
Speaking the wisdom of God’s Word over another to bless, correct,
restore, or uplift them is one of the highest callings. Any member of
the Church can be called to do this: “One who speaks in a tongue edifies
himself; but <em>one who prophesies edifies the church</em>.” (1 Cor.
14:4). “I wish you could all speak in tongues, <em>but even more I wish
you could all prophesy</em>. <em>For prophecy is greater than speaking
in tongues</em>, . . .” (1 Cor. 14:5). A prophet speaks God’s Word. If
you use the wisdom of Jesus’ Word to edify, bless, correct, or
encourage, you are a prophet.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Also use your other gifts for God’s service</u>. God endowed
Solomon with great wisdom and wealth that he initially used to further
God’s Kingdom. Even if you don’t feel wise, God has given you gifts to
serve Him: “As <em>each one has received a special gift</em>, employ it
in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.”
(1 Pet. 4:10). “Since <em>we have gifts that differ according to the
grace given to us</em>, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if
prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith; if service, in his
serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; or he who exhorts, in his
exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with
diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.” (Ro. 12:6-8). “And He
gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists,
and some as pastors and teachers, <sup>12</sup> for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of
Christ;” (Eph. 4:11-12). “Now concerning <em>spiritual</em>
<em>gifts</em>, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware. . . .
<sup>.4</sup> Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
<sup>5</sup> And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
<sup>6</sup> There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works
all things in all persons. <sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the
manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” (1 Cor. 12:1-7). Every
person’s gift is needed in the body of Christ because no one person has
them all (1 Cor. 12:13-27). There is also no gift labeled “spectator”
within the Church. “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the
Lord rather than for men.” (Col. 3:23). Are you using your gifts for
Christ?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is also faithful to bless you when you serve Him</u>.
Solomon’s great wisdom and world renown fulfilled God’s prior promise to
make him the wisest king on Earth: “Behold, I have given you a wise and
discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you before you, nor
shall one like you arise after you.” (1 Kgs. 3:12). Solomon’s “fame was
known in all the surrounding nations.” (1 Kgs. 4:31). Even when you sin
or fall short, He will also be faithful to keep His promises to you:
“God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His
Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). “Let us hold fast the
confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is
faithful;” (Heb. 10:23; same, 1 Cor. 10:13; 2 Cor. 1:18; 1 Thess. 5:24;
2 Thess. 3:3; 2 Tim. 2:13). God promises to pour out His blessings when
you obey and serve Him (Dt. 28:1-14). When you serve Him, do you trust
in His promises to bless you?</p></li>

<u>Praise God for His Truths and For His Guidance</u>. 1 Kgs.
10:8-12.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The queen of Sheba and King Hiram find joy and give praises
and gold for God</u>. After discovering the wonders of Solomon’s
God-given wisdom, the queen of Sheba praised God and gave riches to
honor Him. Having also discovered God’s wondrous truths, King Hiram from
Lebanon also continued to give gifts of tribute for God:
‘“<sup>8 </sup><em>How blessed are your men, how blessed are these your
servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom.
<sup>9 </sup>Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God
who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel; because the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> loved Israel forever, therefore He
made you king, to do justice and righteousness.’ <sup>10 </sup>She gave
the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great amount
of spices and precious stones. Never again did such abundance of spices
come in as that which the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
<sup>11 </sup>Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir,
brought in from Ophir a very great number of almug trees and precious
stones. <sup>12 </sup>The king made of the almug trees supports for the
house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and for the king’s
house, also lyres and harps for the singers; such almug trees have not
come in again nor have they been seen to this day</em>.” (1 Kgs.
10:10-12). When you receive God’s wisdom, you should also praise God and
give thanks by investing in His Kingdom.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Spirit-led believers should desire to invest in the Kingdom of
God out of gratitude</u>. Like the queen of Sheba and King Hiram,
believers who discover the Kingdom of God should feel led out of
gratitude, praise and joy to invest their time, talent, and treasures in
it: “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which
a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all
that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
merchant seeking fine pearls, and upon finding one pearl of great value,
he went and sold all that he had and bought it.” (Matt. 13:44-45). Do
you joyfully give to God’s Kingdom? Or, is it a burden for you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Show your gratitude by making your life a living sacrifice for
Jesus</u>. If you are grateful for all that Jesus has given you, you
should also make your life a living sacrifice for Him: “Therefore I urge
you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living
and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service
of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). Have you given the best of your life to Him as
an act of worship?</p></li>

<u>When You Seek God’s Wisdom in Faith, He Promises to Reward You</u>. 1
Kgs. 10:13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Through Solomon, God rewarded the queen of Sheba for seeking
Him in faith</u>. As he was led by the Spirit, Solomon freely gave his
time to answer the queen of Sheba’s questions. He also rewarded her
financially for seeking God’s hidden truths: “<sup>13 </sup><em>King
Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire which she requested,
besides what he gave her according to his royal bounty. Then she turned
and went to her own land together with her servants</em>.” (1 Kgs.
10:13). God never wants you to seek Him for a reward. Yet, when you seek
Him with the right motives, He promises to reward you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will reward those who seek out His wisdom and
righteousness</u>. Like the queen of Sheba, if you seek God’s kingdom,
His righteousness, and His wisdom, He also promises to provide for your
needs: “How blessed is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains
understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver and
her gain better than fine gold. She is more precious than jewels; and
nothing you desire compares with her.” (Prov. 3:13-15) “But seek first
His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to
you.” (Matt. 6:33). Thus, you don’t need to worry about His provision of
food or clothes (Matt. 6:25-34). If you worry about your provision, you
are showing a lack of trust in Him. If you are in need, are you seeking
after God’s wisdom?</p></li>

<u>Coveting God’s Blessing Places You Under Satan’s Influence</u>. 1
Kgs. 10:14-22.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Like Satan, Solomon misused God’s blessings to glorify
himself</u>. God fulfilled His promise to bless Solomon financially.
Solomon, however, failed to use these gifts to glorify God. Instead,
like Satan who bears the number 666, Solomon used his gifts to bring
glory to himself: “<sup>14 </sup><em>Now the weight of gold which came
in to Solomon in one year was <u>666</u> talents of gold,
<sup>15 </sup>besides that from the traders and the wares of the
merchants and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the
country. <sup>16 </sup>King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten
gold, using 600 shekels of gold on each large shield. <sup>17 </sup>He
made 300 shields of beaten gold, using three minas of gold on each
shield, and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<sup>18 </sup>Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and
overlaid it with refined gold. <sup>19 </sup>There were six steps to the
throne and a round top to the throne at its rear, and arms on each side
of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms.
<sup>20 </sup>Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps on the
one side and on the other; nothing like it was made for any other
kingdom. <sup>21 </sup>All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold,
and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
gold. None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of
Solomon. <sup>22 </sup>For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish
with the ships of Hiram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish
came bringing gold and silver, ivory and apes and peacocks</em>.” (1
Kgs. 10:14-22). Solomon received 666 talents of gold annually (1 Kgs.
10:14). A talent equaled approximately 75 pounds. Thus, he received
approximately 49,950 pounds of gold per year. This was in addition to
the money that he received as a tax from trade within his territories (1
Kgs. 10:15). God previously promised to bless Solomon with great
financial wealth because he only asked for wisdom while serving as King:
“I have also given you what you have not asked, both riches and honor,
so that there will not be any among the kings like you all your days.”
(1 Kgs. 3:13). Solomon at first used this wealth to bless the people:
“<sup>20 </sup>Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is on
the seashore in abundance; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.”
(1 Kgs. 4:20). Yet, he then invested in great works to honor himself. He
made opulent displays of his wealth. This included 200 large shields,
each with 7 1/2 half pounds of gold, 300 smaller shields, each with 3.75
pounds of gold, a throne made of ivory and gold and apes and peacocks to
impress visitors. Even though his motives were wrong, His white throne
foreshadowed Jesus’ great white throne (Rev. 20:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Like Solomon, the antichrist may lose his love of God through
covetousness</u>. Besides the antichrist, no other person in the Bible
has the dubious distinction of being associated with both “wisdom” and
the number “666” (1 Kgs. 10:14). “Here is wisdom. Let him who has
understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that
of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.” (Rev. 13:18).
His coveting placed him in communion with Satan: “For all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful
pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.” (1 Jo.
2:16). One commentator suggests that this might be a Biblical warning
that the antichrist might be unexpected because he will start off as a
wise man of God who becomes corrupted through covetousness: “In fact,
the Revelation passage specifically says that the number 666 is <em>the
number of a man</em>, and the <em>man</em> may be Solomon. ii. <em>This
isn’t to say that Solomon was the Antichrist or that the coming
Antichrist will be some strange reincarnation of Solomon. But it may
indicate that the Antichrist may not be someone purely evil from the
very beginning. Instead, he may be like Solomon – a good man
corrupted</em>.” (David Guzik on 1 Kgs. 10) (italics in original).<a
href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Store up your blessings in heaven and not on Earth</u>. Unlike
Solomon, Jesus calls upon every believer to store up their God-given
wealth in heaven, not on Earth: “But store up for yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do
not break in or steal;” (Matt. 6:19-20; Lk. 12:33). In heaven, He will
reward you with a relationship with Him as part of your inheritance:
“And it shall be with regard to an inheritance for them, that <em>I am
their inheritance</em>; and you shall give them no possession in
Israel-- <em>I am their possession</em>.” (Ezek. 44:28). “The LORD is my
portion; I have promised to keep Your words.” (Ps. 119:57). “The LORD is
the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.” (Ps.
16:5). “But you will be called the priests of the LORD; you will be
spoken of as ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of nations,
and in their riches you will boast. Instead of your shame you will have
a double portion, and instead of humiliation they will shout for joy
over their portion. Therefore they will possess a double portion in
their land, everlasting joy will be theirs.” (Is. 61:6-7). The Holy
Spirit is His down payment on your eternal inheritance: “who also sealed
us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts <em>as a pledge</em>.” (2 Cor.
1:22). Also, when you act in one accord with your fellow believers for
Christ, Jesus further gives part of His glory to you (Jo. 17:22). If you
are grateful for what you are going to receive, what are you doing with
your life to give thanks? (Ro. 12:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ promise of rewards in heaven for those who deny
themselves for Him on Earth</u>. Jesus also promises to reward you in
the eternal Promised Land if you deny yourself for His righteousness:
“But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;” (Matt.
6:20). “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field,
which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells
all that he has and buys that field.” (Matt. 13:44). “I will give you
the treasures of darkness and hidden wealth of secret places, so that
you may know that it is I, the LORD, the God of Israel, who calls you by
your name.” (Is. 45:3). The treasures that He promises will also never
perish (1 Cor. 9:25). To store up treasures in heaven you must deny
yourself for His righteousness: “Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘If
any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish
ways, take up your cross, and follow me.”’ (Matt. 16:24). Yet, to
receive your reward in heaven, you must also deny yourself in secret. If
you deny yourself or do good works for the recognition of others, you
have received your reward (Matt. 6:4). Are you denying yourself for Him
to store up treasures in heaven? (Josh. 16:2-3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Don’t credit your God-given wisdom or other gifts to your own
actions</u>. Like Solomon, many successful people honor themselves with
their gifts because they feel responsible for their accomplishments or
knowledge. Yet, believers should never boast in their God-given wisdom
or other gifts. “Thus says the LORD, ‘<em>Let not a wise man boast of
his wisdom</em>, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not
a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this,
that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises
lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in
these things,’ declares the LORD.” (Jer. 9:23-24). “But may it never be
that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”
(Gal. 6:14). If you boast in your accomplishments, you are more likely
to hoard your gifts. When others praise you, do you praise
Jesus?</p></li>

<u>God’s Wisdom is Greater Than Any Earthly Treasure</u>. 1 Kgs.

<ul>
<li><p><u>Pagan kings valued God’s wisdom in Solomon greater than any
earthly treasure</u>. Although Solomon misused God’s blessings to
glorify himself, the pagan kings around him still paid him fortunes to
receive the blessings of God’s wisdom: “<sup>23 </sup><em>So King
Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in
wisdom. <sup>24 </sup>All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon,
to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. <sup>25 </sup>They
brought every man his gift, articles of silver and gold, garments,
weapons, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year</em>.” (1 Kgs.
10:23-25). When he obeyed God, God set Solomon high above the Earth (1
Kgs. 4:30). This also fulfilled a promise in Deuteronomy: “Now it shall
be, if you diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all
His commandments which I command you today, the LORD your God will set
you high above all the nations of the earth.” (Dt. 28:1). The pagan
leaders’ acts of tributes spanned from the beginning to the end of his
reign: “<sup>21 </sup>Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the
River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they
brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.” (1 Kgs.
4:21).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s wisdom is worth more than any earthly honor or
treasure</u>. Even though God’s wisdom may bring honor, respect, or
money, Solomon later learned from his mistakes that God’s wisdom is
worth more than any money: “How much better it is to get wisdom than
gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver.” (Prov.
16:16). “My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, and my yield
better than choicest silver.” (Prov. 8:19). Do you seek out riches,
power, and respect? or God’s wisdom?</p></li>
<li><p><u>When you do God’s will, He will also reward you</u>. When you
step out in faith to serve Jesus, He promises to bless you in many
different ways. This can include a prolonged life: “So you shall observe
to do just as the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn
aside to the right or to the left. You shall walk in all the ways which
the Lord your God has commanded you, that you may live and that <em>it
may be well with you</em>, <em>and that you may prolong your days in the
land which you will possess</em>.” (Dt. 5:32-33). This might be a year,
a day, or some other increment of time. Only in heaven will you learn
how much time was added to your life. Believers can also receive five
kinds of crowns, a number symbolizing His grace. First, those who
persevere in the face of trials, like Caleb, will also receive a crown
of life: “Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has
been approved, he will receive <em>the crown of life</em> which the Lord
has promised to those who love Him.” (Ja. 1:12; ; Rev. 2:10). Second,
those who live pure while waiting for His return, will receive a crown
of righteousness: “in the future there is laid up for me the <em>crown
of righteousness</em>, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award
to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved
His appearing.” (2 Tim. 4:8). Third, those who exercise self-control
will receive an “<em>incorruptible crown</em>” (1 Cor. 9:25-27). Fourth,
elders, pastors, teachers, leaders, and shepherds of God’s flock will
also receive “<em>a crown of glory</em>” (1 Pet. 5:4). Finally, those
who help lead others to Christ will receive a “<em>crown of
rejoicing</em>” (1 Thess. 2:19; ). Are you living a righteous life to
receive all the crowns available to you?</p></li>

<u>Hoarding God’s Blessing Violates God’s Word and Leads to Misery</u>.
1 Kgs. 10:26-29.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Solomon violated God’s Word by coveting</u>. As Solomon
hoarded wealth and power (symbolized through horses and chariots), he
violated God’s law that he had sworn to uphold as King of Israel:
“<sup>26 </sup><em>Now Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he
had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, and he stationed them in the
chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. <sup>27 </sup>The king
made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars as
plentiful as sycamore trees that are in the lowland. <sup>28 </sup>Also
Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s
merchants procured them from Kue for a price. <sup>29 </sup>A chariot
was imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver, and a horse for 150;
and by the same means they exported them to all the kings of the
Hittites and to the kings of the Arameans</em>.” (1 Kgs. 10:26-29). In
addition to gifts, Solomon taxed the trade between Egypt and Syria and
Turkey as a middleman. Yet, as he obtained wealth and horses and
chariots, he violated the laws that God set to protect his
heart.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon violated God’s law against a king seeking to multiply
his wealth</u>. By multiplying his power and wealth (as symbolized
through horses), Solomon violated God’s law that was meant to protect
His leaders from coveting: “Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for
himself, nor shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply
horses, since the LORD has said to you, ‘You shall never again return
that way.”’ (Dt. 17:16). Isaiah later condemned the kings who did the
exact same thing that Solomon did here: “Woe to those who go down to
Egypt for help and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they
are many and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they do not
look to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek the LORD!” (Is. 31:1). Instead
of trusting in horses and chariots for protection, God wanted Solomon to
place his trust in Him: “Some boast in chariots and some in horses, but
we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.” (Ps. 20:7). Wealth is
not by itself evil. It is only when you develop a love of money that it
becomes a sin (1 Tim. 6:10). Do you love money and prestige?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Coveting cannot be satisfied by giving in to temptation</u>.
Solomon’s coveting began with money and power. It then grew to include
women. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he could not satisfy his
coveting by feeding it. The coveting that the devil offers can only be
satisfied through more coveting (Heb. 11:25; Lk. 12:19-20). “And the
dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have
no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each one to his
unjust gain, to the last one.” (Is. 56:11; Hab. 2:5). “Sheol, and the
barren womb, earth that is never satisfied with water, and fire that
never says, ‘Enough’.” (Prov. 30:16). Giving into your temptations only
leads to misery as you are unable to find peace and contentment. Are you
giving into your temptations?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Coveting is a sin of the heart that leads to more serious sins
when left unchecked</u>. Coveting is a sin of the heart that defiles
you. Jesus warned: “For from within, <em>out of the heart of men,
proceed the evil thoughts</em>, fornications, thefts, murders,
adulteries, <em>deeds of coveting</em> and wickedness, as well as
deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness. All these evil
things proceed from within and <em>defile the man</em>.” (Mk. 7:21-23).
God prohibits coveting because it leads to other more serious sins.
Every believer is at times guilty of this sin (Rom. 3:20). Jesus and
Paul analogized sin to yeast, the fastest growing microorganism (Mk.
8:15; 1 Cor. 5:7-8). If you are entertaining small sins of the flesh,
will they stay small for long?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Solomon later lamented his covetousness</u>. Solomon acquired
incredible wealth. “I enlarged my works: I built houses for myself, I
planted vineyards for myself;” (Ecc. 2:4). Yet, he later lamented that
his actions were wasted vanity. “I have seen all the works which have
been done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and striving after
wind. What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot
be counted.” (Ecc. 1:14-15). Are you chasing after vain accomplishments,
wealth, or power? If so, you may one day look back on your life and be
filled with regret.</p></li>
<li><p><u>To fight covetousness, fear God</u>. Solomon was the wisest
man alive and the author of most of the proverbs. Yet, by giving into
covetousness, he first hoarded money. He then gave into his covetousness
and lusts when he took 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kgs. 11:1-8). The
best way to protect against pride is to be humble and fear God: “The
fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and
instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; Rom 7:7). The fear of God is defined in the
Bible as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:12). Do you hate it when you desire
something that is not of God?</p></li>
<li><p><u>To fight covetousness, praise Jesus for all your undeserved
blessings</u>. Every good and perfect gift in your life comes from above
(Jam. 1:17). Because Jesus is the true source of your wisdom and your
blessings, thanking Him for it can help to prevent a sense of
entitlement: “Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice
of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His
name.” (Heb. 13:14). “To You I shall offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
and call upon the name of the LORD.” (Ps. 116:17). “Enter His gates with
thanksgiving and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His
name.” (Ps. 100:4). Are you praising Jesus for His blessings of
wisdom?</p></li>
<li><p><u>To fight covetousness, deny yourself physical pleasures and
covet the things of God</u>. Jesus reveals that to follow Him you should
deny yourself certain worldly pleasures: “Then Jesus said to His
disciples, ‘If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and
take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life
will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. For
what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his
soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”’ (Matt.
16:24-26). The one thing in life that you should covet is a deeper
relationship with God: “As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my
soul pants for You, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God;
when shall I come and appear before God?” (Ps. 42:1-2; Matt. 6:6, 19-24;
13:44-46; 1 Cor. 12:31; Phil. 3:7-14). The Bible reveals that “godliness
with contentment” is “great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6). “Make sure that your
character is free from the love of money, being content with what you
have; for He Himself has said, ‘I will never desert you, nor will I ever
forsake you,”’ (Heb. 13:5). Are you content seeking to draw closer to
God?</p></li>
