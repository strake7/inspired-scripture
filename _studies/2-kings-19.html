Kings 19: Lessons From Hezekiah’s Faithful Example Regarding the
Blessings that God Offers To All Believers</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u>: This chapter tells of one of the many great
miracles of the Bible. The mighty Assyrian army had destroyed the 10
tribes of Northern Israel. It then invaded and took all of Judah’s
fortified cities. Only Jerusalem remained. But King Hezekiah had a faith
unlike any king since David. In response to his prayers, Isaiah
prophesied that God would protect Judah and judge the Assyrians. God
then kept His promises. The angel of the Lord wiped out 185,000 Assyrian
soldiers and saved Jerusalem. From Hezekiah’s faithful example, God
reveals seven things that He offers to all faithful believers. These
include: (1) guidance, (2) encouragement, (3) protection, (4)
deliverance, (5) answered prayers, (6) restoration, and (7)
forgiveness.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, Hezekiah faced what looked like certain defeat. Yet, he
showed his faith by seeking God’s guidance through his prayers. God
later blessed all of Judah because of his faithful example. From
Hezekiah’s example, God reveals that He wants to also guide you when you
seek Him faithfully in prayer. <u>Second</u>, through Isaiah, God gave
Hezekiah His Word of encouragement. God also offers to encourage you
when you seek Him. <u>Third</u>, King Sennacherib of Assyria boasted
that God could not stop him. Satan also tries to scare you with his
empty threats to destroy you. When you walk with God, He offers to
protect you from the evil one’s attacks. <u>Fourth</u>, in response to
Sennacherib’s blasphemous pride, Hezekiah prayed for God’s deliverance.
God honored his prayers by defeating Sennacherib’s entire army. When you
have faith, God also offers to deliver you in times of struggle.
<u>Fifth</u>, in response to Hezekiah’s faith, Isaiah prophesied God’s
judgment upon the Assyrian army. When you pray faithfully and fervently,
God also offers to answer your prayers. <u>Sixth</u>, God also promised
to restore Judah through a remnant that He would save. When you repent
and seek Him, God also offers to restore you from sin’s destructive
consequences. <u>Finally</u>, God forgive Judah for its sins. God also
gave the King of Assyria 20 extra years after He defeated the Assyrian
army to repent. From these examples, God reveals that He is
long-suffering and can forgive even the worst of sinners.</p>

<u>Guidance: God Offers to Guide You When You Seek Him in Prayer</u>. 2
Kgs. 19:1-4.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah seeks God’s guidance through prayer</u>. Faced with
the destruction of Judah, Hezekiah showed his faith by seeking God’s
guidance and protection through his prayers: “<sup>1</sup> <em>And when
King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with
sackcloth and entered the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>2 </sup>Then he sent Eliakim who was
over the household with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests,
covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<sup>3 </sup>They said to him, ‘Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day
of distress, rebuke, and rejection; for children have come to birth and
there is no strength to deliver. <sup>4 </sup>Perhaps the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God will hear all the words of
Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the
living God, and will rebuke the words which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has heard. Therefore, offer a
prayer for the remnant that is left</em>.’’” (2 Kgs. 19:1-4). By the
fourth year of his reign, Hezekiah witnessed the Assyrian army
completely destroy the larger nation of Northern Israel with its 10
tribes (2 Kgs. 18:9). By the 14<sup>th</sup> year of his reign, he also
witnessed the Assyrians capture all of Judah’s fortified cities (2 Kgs.
18:13; 2 Chron. 32:1; Is. 36:1). The Assyrians then taunted the Jews
that no one, including Yahweh, could deliver them (2 Kgs. 18:19-37). A
man without faith might have either surrendered or sent his people to
their death against the Assyrian army. But Hezekiah was unlike any king
since David. He tore his clothes as a sign of morning. He covered
himself in sackcloth as a sign of repentance and humility. He then went
to the Temple courtyard to pray for God’s deliverance (2 Kgs. 19:1; 2
Chr. 32:20; Is. 37:1-2). He then sent his servant Eliakim to go to God’s
prophet Isaiah for guidance (2 Kgs. 19:2-4; Is. 37:2-4). Although Isaiah
had at this point served as God’s prophet for 40 years (including during
the reigns of King Uzzah and King Azariah), Hezekiah was the first king
to either seek out or listen to God’s Word. From the book of Chronicles,
we learn that Isaiah then also cried out in prayer (2 Chr.
32:20).</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God puts you through trials so that you may turn to Him</u>.
After the Jews had escaped from Egypt, Moses explained that God
frequently tests His people: “for God has come in order to <em>test
you</em>, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that
you may not sin.” (Ex. 20:20(b); Dt. 8:2). David also warned that even
the righteous are not beyond God’s testing: “<em>The Lord tests the
righteous and the wicked</em> . . .” (Ps. 11:5). “I, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, search the heart, <em>I test the
mind</em>, . . .” (Jer. 17:10). God’s testing and discipline are done
out of love (Heb. 12:6). When you are tested, you may find that your
heart has hidden anger, lust, or covetousness. When God exposes
wickedness, He expects you to repent of it: “the heart is deceitful
above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9).
David invited God’s testing to show him where he needed to change (Ps.
139:23). Your trials should produce perseverance and endurance: “And not
only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that
tribulation brings about perseverance;” (Ro. 5:3). “Consider it all joy,
my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing
of your faith produces endurance.” (Jam. 1:2-3). Paul endured a similar
trial when he faced death in Asia. He advised that God put him through
trials so that he would rely upon Him and not his own strength:
“<sup>8 </sup>For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our
affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively,
beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life;
<sup>9 </sup>indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so
that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; .
. . He on whom we have set our hope. And He will yet deliver us,” (2
Cor. 1:8-10). God used these trials to prepare Hezekiah and turn his
heart fully to Him. Are you turning to Jesus to build up your faith and
deliver you during your trials?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Cry out to God when you need guidance</u>. God’s Word is a
lamp unto your path when you cry out in prayer for guidance “Your word
is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Ps. 119:105). The Holy
Spirit then applies God’s Word to guide you when you need help (Jo.
16:13). Like Hezekiah, David also cried out for God’s guidance when he
risked losing his kingdom: “Perhaps the LORD will look on my affliction
and return good to me instead of his cursing this day.” (2 Sam. 16:12).
Like David and Hezekiah, God wants you to cry out to Him in faith when
you are in need of deliverance: “O LORD, how my adversaries have
increased! Many are rising up against me. Many are saying of my soul,
‘There is no deliverance for him in God.’ Selah. But You, O LORD, are a
shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. I was crying
to the LORD with my voice, and He answered me from His holy mountain.
Selah. I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustains me. I will
not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against
me round about.” (Ps. 3:1-6; 25:2). If you feel that you are facing a
hopeless situation, have you cried out to God for guidance?</p></li>

<u>Encouragement: God Offers to Encourage You When You Seek Him</u>. 2
Kgs. 19:5-7.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Isaiah speaks God’s Word of encouragement to Hezekiah</u>. In
response to Hezekiah’s faith, God used Isaiah to give him His Word of
encouragement. This included God’s promise that He would judge the King
of Assyria: “<sup>5 </sup><em>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to
Isaiah. <sup>6 </sup>Isaiah said to them, ‘Thus you shall say to your
master, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘Do not be
afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants
of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. <sup>7 </sup>Behold, I will
put a spirit in him so that he will hear a rumor and return to his own
land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land</em>.’’’” (2
Kgs. 19:5-7). Through Isaiah, God promised that the Jews did not need to
fear the blasphemous King Sennacherib of Assyria (2 Kgs. 19:6). God
promised to cause King Sennacherib to hear rumors and return to Nineveh
where his own people would betray him and kill him (2 Kgs. 19:7). God
later showed His faithfulness by fulfilling His promises when King
Sennacherib’s sons killed him (2 Kgs. 19:35-37).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Never fear your enemy when you do God’s will</u>. Through
Isaiah, God also encouraged Hezekiah not to fear his enemy: “<em>‘Do not
be afraid</em>. . .” (2 Kgs. 19:6). Moses also encouraged the Jews not
to fear their enemies: “When you go out to battle against your enemies
and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, <em>do
not be afraid of them</em>; for the LORD your God, who brought you up
from the land of Egypt, is with you.” (Dt. 20:1). “He shall say to them,
‘Hear, O Israel, you are approaching the battle against your enemies
today. Do not be fainthearted. <em>Do not be afraid</em>, or panic, or
tremble before them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you,
to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’” (Dt. 20:3-4). “The
LORD is the one who goes ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not
fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.” (Dt. 31:8). If
your faith is lacking, God calls upon you to build it up through reading
the Word: “[F]aith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ.” (Ro. 10:17). The next time you fear, recite His promises: “Do
not fear for I am with you; do not anxiously look about you, for I am
your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will uphold you with My
righteous right hand . . . Do not fear, I will help you.” (Is. 41:10,
13). “For I know the plans I have for you . . . plans for welfare and
not calamity to give you a future and a hope.” (Jer. 29:11). “For God
has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and
discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7). Faith is like a muscle. It can atrophy if you
don’t read the Word. Are you reading the Word and praying to build up
your faith? Do you trust God in faith to fight your battles?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Persevere for God when you face a setback or defeat</u>.
Hezekiah sought out God’s Word when he felt defeated. He had lost all of
the fortified cities of Judah. Only Jerusalem remained. Samuel also at
one point felt defeated. He felt this way when his pupil Saul rebelled
against God. God then encouraged Samuel (1 Sam. 16:1). Joshua also felt
defeated after Moses died. Yet, God then encouraged Joshua to carry on
and trust in Him to lead His people into the Promised Land (Josh. 1:2).
Your faith in Jesus should also cause you to run the race and persevere
in all your challenges: “Therefore, . . . <em>let us run with endurance
the race that is set before us</em>, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the
author and perfecter of faith . . .” (Heb. 12:1-2). “<em>I press on</em>
toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ
Jesus.” (Phil. 3:14). “I have fought the good fight, <em>I have finished
the course</em>, I have kept the faith;” (2 Tim. 4:7). The kind of
perseverance is spiritual and not physical: “for bodily discipline is
only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since
it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come (1
Tim. 4:8). Are you searching the Word and praying when you are feeling
defeated? Has a failure or a setback caused you to give up?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Have faith that God will also protect you when you do His
will</u>. God promised to protect the Jews when they acted in faith-led
obedience (Dt. 28:1-14). As led by the Holy Spirit, David also promised
Solomon that obedience would ensure that their descendants continued to
rule on the throne: “<sup>4 </sup>so that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> may carry out His promise which He spoke
concerning me, saying, ‘If your sons are careful of their way, to walk
before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you
shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’” (1 Kgs. 2:4). When the
Jews walked with Him, God also promised to cause their enemies to fear
them: “I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all
the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn
their backs to you.” (Ex. 23:27). ‘“This day I will begin to put the
dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens,
who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish
because of you.’” (Dt. 2:25). You also never need to fear your enemies
when you act in Spirit-led obedience and do God’s will. If you are
serving God, do you trust Him to protect you?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Encourage one another in spiritual warfare</u>. Isaiah used
God’s Word to encourage Hezekiah and the Jews. As a believer, you are
commanded to use God’s Word to encourage others each day. “But encourage
one another day after day, as long as it is still called ‘Today,’ so
that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (Heb.
3:13). “But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation,
for I have written to you briefly.” (Heb. 13:22). “Be on the alert,
stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.” (1 Cor. 16:13). “Be
strong and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in the LORD.”
(Ps. 31:24). Are you using God’s Word to encourage those who are in
need?</p></li>

<u>Protection: God Offers to Protect You From the Evil One’s
Attacks</u>. 2 Kgs. 19:8-13.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The Assyrians mock and blaspheme God</u>. In his moment of
pride, King Sennacherib boasted to Rabshakeh that Yahweh was no match
against his mighty Assyrian army: “<sup>8 </sup><em>Then Rabshakeh
returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he
had heard that the king had left Lachish. <sup>9 </sup>When he heard
them say concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, ‘Behold, he has come out to
fight against you,’ he sent messengers again to Hezekiah saying,
<sup>10 </sup>‘Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let
your God in whom you trust deceive you saying, ‘Jerusalem will not be
given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ <sup>11 </sup>Behold, you
have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands,
destroying them completely. So will you be spared? <sup>12 </sup>Did the
gods of those nations which my fathers destroyed deliver them, even
Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?
<sup>13 </sup>Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king
of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah</em>?’’” (2 Kgs.
19:8-13). This was King Sennacherib’s second boast against God. ‘“Has
any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of
the king of Assyria? . . . Who among all the gods of the lands have
delivered their land from my hand, that the LORD should deliver
Jerusalem from my hand?”’ (2 Kgs. 18:33-35). He believed that he was
unstoppable because he defeated every other pagan idol and king that he
faced in the areas of modern day Iraq and Syria (2 Kgs. 19:11-13). But
God’s many miracles were known throughout the pagan world. For example,
Rahab once confessed: “For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water
of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did
to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon
and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.” (Josh. 2:10). Sennacherib’s pride
had blinded him to God’s true power. But God would soon humble him and
then judge him.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Greater is He who is in you than the ruler of this world</u>.
At the time he threatened Hezekiah, King Sennacherib was the most
powerful man in the world. He acted under Satan’s influence, the ruler
of this world (Jo. 12:31; Eph. 2:2). Like Sennacherib, Satan was
prideful and sought to rule over all (Is. 14:12-17). His power can seem
scary. Yet, like Sennacherib, God has judged him for his pride and
rebellion (Rev. 20:10). You also don’t need to fear Satan. “You are from
God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who
is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4). “I am writing to
you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am
writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I
have written to you, children, because you know the Father.’ (1 Jo.
2:13). Thus, when you walk with God, you don’t need to fear Satan. His
days are numbered.</p></li>

<u>Deliverance: God Offers to Deliver You in Times of Struggle</u>. 2
Kgs. 19:14-19.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Hezekiah’s prayer for deliverance</u>. In the face of
Sennacherib’s blasphemous pride, Hezekiah prayed for God’s deliverance:
“<sup>14 </sup><em>Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the
messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and spread it out before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>15 </sup>Hezekiah prayed before the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and said, ‘O <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who are enthroned
above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of
the earth. You have made heaven and earth. <sup>16 </sup>Incline Your
ear, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and hear; open Your eyes, O
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and see; and listen to the words of
Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
<sup>17 </sup>Truly, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the kings of
Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands <sup>18 </sup>and
have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work
of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.
<sup>19 </sup>Now, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, I
pray, deliver us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may
know that You alone, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, are
God</em>.” (2 Kgs. 19:14-19; Is. 37:16-20). After learning from his
mistake in trying to trust in his own wealth to appease Sennacherib (2
Kgs. 18:14-16), Hezekiah turned to God. After David, he was sadly alone
amongst the Kings of Judah and Northern Israel in how he placed his
trust in God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s power does not compare to the idols of the world</u>.
Hezekiah appealed to God’s omnipotent power to save them (2 Kgs. 19:15).
Moses also once faced a Pharaoh with a similar arrogance and disdain for
Yahweh. Moses advised that he would live to see Yahweh’s power: “Then he
said, ‘Tomorrow.’ So he said, ‘May it be according to your word, that
you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God.”’ (Ex. 8:10).
Approximately 80 years later, Moses told the Jews that God allowed them
to witness His many miracles in the wilderness so that they would know
that He is unique and unlike any other: “To you it was shown that you
might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him.”
(Dt. 4:35). David also proclaimed God’s unique power: “For this reason
You are great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like You, and there is no
God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.” (2
Sam. 7:22). Isaiah also counseled the people who lived in Hezekiah’s
time that God was not like an idol: “Thus says the LORD, the King of
Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: ‘I am the first and I am the
last, and there is no God besides Me.”’ (Is. 44:6). “Ah Lord GOD!
Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and
by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You,” (Jer.
32:17). With faith in God, even the impossible is possible: “And looking
at them Jesus said to them, ‘With people this is impossible, but with
God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26; Mk. 10:27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Depend upon Jesus, the Rock of your salvation</u>. Hezekiah
celebrated God who “<em>made heaven and earth.</em>” (2 Kgs. 19:15).
With that kind of power, Hezekiah celebrated that he could depend upon
God. David also placed his trust in the “the Rock of Israel”, who
encouraged him: “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and
the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You
save me from violence.” (2 Sam. 22:3; Ps. 18:2). “The LORD lives, and
blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation,” (Ps.
18:46). “The LORD is their strength, and He is a saving defense to His
anointed.” (Ps. 28:8). Paul reveals that “the rock was Christ.” (1 Cor.
10:4). He is our Rock and the power or horn of our salvation: “And has
raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant—”
(Lk. 1:69). Like Hezekiah and David, Jesus wants you to call upon Him as
your Rock of deliverance in times of trouble.</p></li>

<u>Answered Prayers: God Offers to Answer Your Faithful Prayers</u>. 2
Kgs. 19:20-28.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Isaiah’s prophecy of judgment against the Assyrians</u>. In
response to Hezekiah’s faith and Sennacherib’s apostasy, Isaiah
prophesied God’s judgment upon the Assyrian army:
“<sup>20 </sup><em>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying,
‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel,
‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have
heard you.’ <sup>21 </sup>This is the word that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has spoken against him: ‘She has despised
you and mocked you, the virgin daughter of Zion; she has shaken her head
behind you, the daughter of Jerusalem! <sup>22 </sup>‘Whom have you
reproached and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice,
and haughtily lifted up your eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!
<sup>23 </sup>‘Through your messengers you have reproached the Lord, and
you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the
mountains, to the remotest parts of Lebanon; and I cut down its tall
cedars and its choice cypresses. And I entered its farthest lodging
place, its thickest forest. <sup>24 </sup>I dug wells and drank foreign
waters, and with the sole of my feet I dried up all the rivers of Egypt.
<sup>25 </sup>Have you not heard? Long ago I did it; from ancient times
I planned it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should turn
fortified cities into ruinous heaps. <sup>26 </sup>Therefore their
inhabitants were short of strength, they were dismayed and put to shame;
they were as the vegetation of the field and as the green herb, as grass
on the housetops is scorched before it is grown up. <sup>27 </sup>But I
know your sitting down, and your going out and your coming in, and your
raging against Me. <sup>28 </sup>Because of your raging against Me, and
because your arrogance has come up to My ears, therefore I will put My
hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back
by the way which you came</em>.”’ (2 Kgs. 19:20-28; Is. 37:22-29).
Isaiah prophesied about the “daughter of Zion” (2 Kgs. 19:21). This term
is frequently used in reference to Jerusalem (Jer. 4:31; Zeph. 3:14;
Zech. 2:10). God would judge them the way that they had judged the Jews
of Northern Israel (2 Kgs. 19:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The effective fervent prayer of the righteous can accomplish
great things</u>. Through Isaiah, God made clear that He would move
against the Assyrians in part because Hezekiah prayed for His
intervention: “<sup>20 </sup><em>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to
Hezekiah saying, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of
Assyria, I have heard you.</em>”’ (2 Kgs. 19:20). God acted upon
Hezekiah’s prayers because he first repented. He then prayed fervently
and in faith: “Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for
one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a
righteous man can accomplish much.” (Ja. 5:16). In a similar way, God
heard Elijah’s prayers to both stop and later restart the rain in
Israel: “<sup>17 </sup>Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he
prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the
earth for three years and six months. <sup>18 </sup>Then he prayed
again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.” (Ja.
5:17-18). God also wants you to pray fervently to Him to intervene when
you need deliverance.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Plea as an intercessor for God to help others</u>. God honored
Hezekiah’s prayers as an intercessor. His faith and trust in God made
him unlike any king since David: “<em>He trusted in the LORD, the God of
Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of
Judah, nor among those who were before him</em>.” (2 Kgs. 18:5). Another
man of great faith, Abraham, also used his faith to plead with God as an
intercessor to spare the innocent in Sodom and Gomorra (Gen. 18:23). God
spared the Jewish nation in response to Moses’ faithful prayers after
they made the golden calf (Ex. 32:11-14). He again spared the Jews in
response to Moses’ prayers after they rebelled at the edge of the
Promised Land (Nu. 14:18-22). God again spared the Jews in response to
the prayers of Moses and Aaron after Korah, 250 men of renown, and then
the 14,700 rebelled (Nu. 16:21-24). As an intercessor, Samuel promised
to continue to pray for the people’s sins (1 Sam. 12:23). David also
prayed as an intercessor for God to spare the Jews after 70,000 men
across all of Israel died in a plague that came about because of David’s
sins (2 Sam. 24:17). Elijah also cried out to God in faith for God to
raise a widow’s son from the dead (1 Kgs. 17:21-22.) Jonah also made a
plea as an intercessor when his disobedience caused the men in his boat
to suffer (Jo. 1:12). The apostles also continually prayed for others.
“. . . I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,” (2 Tim.
1:3). “. . . we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may
be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding,” (Col. 1:9). “do not cease giving thanks for you, while
making mention of you in my prayers;” (Eph. 1:16). “as we night and day
keep praying most earnestly that we may see your face, . . .” (1 Thess.
3:10). You are part of Jesus’ holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6).
As His appointed priest, you too have the power of intercessory prayer.
Yet, it doesn’t work if you lack faith. “But he must ask in faith
without any doubting, . . .” (Jam. 1:6). Are you praying as an
intercessor for those whose faith has failed them?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Non-believers are without excuse when they deny God’s
existence and power</u>. Through Isaiah, God also responded to the
Assyrians’ boast regarding their power by reminding them that He parted
the Red Sea to destroy the Pharaoh’s army (2 Kgs. 19:22-24). While they
may have alleged that they were unaware of how Yahweh differed from
pagan idols, Yahweh’s parting of the Red Sea was well-known amongst the
pagan world (e.g., Josh. 2:10). God’s fame in how he used a small
shepherd boy named David to defeat the mighty Goliath was also well
known in the ancient world: “This day the LORD will deliver you up into
my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And
I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to
the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the
earth may know that there is a God in Israel,” (1 Sam. 17:46). Like
non-believers today, they were without excuse in denying God’s
preeminence over every pagan idol: “For since the creation of the world
His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been
clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they
are without excuse.” (Ro. 1:20). No pagan idol could perform miracles.
Thus, they had no excuse in mocking God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is sovereign over all creation and every government</u>.
Although God allowed Assyria to be the rod of His judgment against the
Jews of Northern Israel, He then judged them for their blaspheme: “Woe
to Assyria, the rod of My anger And the staff in whose hands is My
indignation,” (Is. 10:5). Daniel later explained that God is sovereign
and has control over kings, nations, and all time: “It is He who changes
the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He
gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.” (Da.
2:21). “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the
nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23). “Behold, the nations are
like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the
scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.” (Is. 40:15).
“All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as
less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17). “But the LORD is the
true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath
the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure His indignation.” (Jer.
10:10). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from
His land.” (Ps. 10:16). “You shall multiply the nation, You shall
increase their gladness; . . .” (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of
the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in
the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can
ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35).

<u>Restoration: God Offers to Restore You From Sin’s Destructive
Power</u>. 2 Kgs. 19:29-34.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Isaiah’s prophecy of restoration and protection for
Jerusalem</u>. After promising to judge the Assyrians, God promised to
restore the surviving remnant of Jews in Judah: “<sup>29 </sup><em>Then
this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of
itself, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third
year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. <sup>30 </sup>The
surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward
and bear fruit upward. <sup>31 </sup>For out of Jerusalem will go forth
a remnant, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will perform this. <sup>32 </sup>Therefore
thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> concerning the king of
Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he
will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against
it. <sup>33 </sup>By the way that he came, by the same he will return,
and he shall not come to this city,”’ declares the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>34 </sup>‘For I will defend this
city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake</em>.’”
(2 Kgs. 19:29-34). God promised that He would prevent the Assyrians from
even beginning a siege. He would also supernaturally restore the Jews’
devastated crops (2 Kgs. 19:29). Although the Assyrians had seized the
Jews’ fortified cities throughout Judah, God also promised that the
surviving remnant of Jews would once again populate the lands (2 Kgs.
19:30-31). Whenever God allowed calamity to fall upon His people to
correct or discipline them, He always promised to preserve a “remnant”
that He would use to restore His people (Micah 2:12-13; Zeph. 3:8-20).
He then promised to judge the Assyrian army (2 Kgs. 19:32-33; Isa.
37:30-34).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God was faithful to keep His promises to save Jerusalem</u>.
To demonstrate His power, to show His faithfulness, and to humble the
Assyrians, God had Isaiah give additional prophesies about how He would
save Jerusalem: “Like flying birds so the LORD of hosts will protect
Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it; He will pass over and rescue
it.” (Is. 31:5). “For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake
and for My servant David’s sake.’” (Is. 37:35). “I will deliver you and
this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this
city.” (Is. 38:6). “But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and
deliver them by the LORD their God, and will not deliver them by bow,
sword, battle, horses or horsemen.” (Hos. 1:7). And He would soon
fulfill His promises. He would destroy the entire Assyrian army through
a miracle (2 Kgs. 19:34.)</p></li>
<li><p><u>God is always faithful to preserve a remnant</u>. Through
Isaiah, God further promised to keep a “<em>surviving remnant</em>” of
His people in Jerusalem (2 Kgs. 19:30). “For out of Jerusalem will go
forth <em>a remnant</em> and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of
the LORD of hosts will perform this.”’ (Is. 37:32). Through Paul, God
repeated this promise: “In the same way then, there has also come to be
at the present time a remnant according to God’s gracious choice.” (Ro.
11:5). Thus, even when evil abounds, you should never give up hope in
Jesus. He will preserve a remnant to keep His promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also acted so that His people would have faith in His
promises</u>. God promised ‘“<em>For I will defend this city to save it
for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake</em>.’” (2 Kgs. 19:34).
Even though approximately 300 years had passed since God made a covenant
with David, He promised that He would keep His word to David that his
descendants would forever rule over his throne (2 Sam. 7:16; Ezek.
36:22-23; Isa. 9:6-7; 11:1; 55:3). Through David, God also promised that
He would bless and restore any king who ruled righteously: “The God of
Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, ‘He who rules over men
righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is as the light of the
morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, when the tender
grass springs out of the earth, through sunshine after rain.’ Truly is
not my house so with God? For He has made an everlasting covenant with
me, ordered in all things, and secured; for all my salvation and all my
desire, will He not indeed make it grow?” (2 Sam. 23:3-5). Because
Hezekiah reigned in righteousness, he could trust in God’s promises to
bless him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus fulfilled God’s everlasting covenant to show that you
can depend upon Him</u>. Jesus is the eternal King of Kings who came
through David’s line to fulfill God’s “<em>everlasting covenant”</em> (2
Sam. 23:5) “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most
High; and <em>the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever</em>, <em>and His
kingdom will have no end</em>.” (Lk. 1:32-33). “There will be no end to
the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and
over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and
righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of
hosts will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:7). “These will wage war against the
Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and
King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and chosen and
faithful.” (Rev. 17:14). Thus, God is faithful to keep His
promises.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You also can trust in His promises to you</u>. The accuracy of
God’s promises to Hezekiah show how you can also trust His promises for
you as well. “Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to
pass” (1 Thess. 5:24). “Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is
God, the faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to
a thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His
commandments;” (Dt. 7:9). “God is faithful, through whom you were called
into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Cor. 1:9). He
is faithful even when you are not: “If we are faithless, He remains
faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13). Have you given
thanks that you can trust in His faithfulness in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God will heal the lands when His people repent and turn from
sin</u>. Hezekiah’s name means “Jehovah’s strength.” Because of his
faith, God would strengthen and rebuild from a faithful remnant (2 Kgs.
19:29). But Isaiah warned this remnant to be holy and not to squander
God’s mercy and grace: “It will come about that he who is left in Zion
and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy-- everyone who is recorded
for life in Jerusalem.” (Is. 4:3). “Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, and
all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me
from birth and have been carried from the womb;” (Is. 46:3) Today, God
promises to restore His people if they repent and turn back from sin:
“and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and
seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from
heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chr. 7:14).
Are you praying for repentance?</p></li>

<u>Forgiveness: God is Patient to Forgive Even the Worst of Sinners</u>.
2 Kgs. 19:35-37.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s judgment on the Assyrians and King Sennacherib</u>. God
then fulfilled His promises by killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers before
they could even begin a siege. He also fulfilled His promise to judge
King Sennacherib: “<sup>35 </sup><em>Then it happened that night that
the angel of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> went out and struck
185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in the
morning, behold, all of them were dead. <sup>36 </sup>So Sennacherib
king of Assyria departed and returned home, and lived at Nineveh.
<sup>37 </sup>It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch
his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and
they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king
in his place</em>.” (2 Kgs. 19:35-37; 2 Chr. 32:21-22; Is. 37:36-38). On
various occasions, God sent the “angel of the Lord” as the instrument of
His judgment (Gen. 19:15; Ex. 3:2; 2 Sam. 24:16). The angel silently and
instantly caused 185,000 Assyrian soldiers to die. In order to allow
King Sennacherib to know that God judged him, God allowed King
Sennacherib to survive the initial judgment. He then returned to Nineveh
(2 Kgs. 19:36). Approximately 20 years later, God fulfilled His prophecy
when his own family betrayed and murdered him. His sons Adrammelech and
Sharezer murdered him. His third son, Esar-haddon, (681-668 B.C.) then
succeeded him (2 Kgs. 19:37).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God gave King Sennacherib time to repent</u>. King Sennacherib
deserved to die instantly with his soldiers. He was the one who mocked
God. But, out of mercy and grace, God gave him approximately 20 extra
years to repent before He fulfilled His prophecy of judgment. Outside of
the Bible, his own journals confirm his failure to capture Jerusalem.
His records also confirm the existence of King Hezekiah. Instead of
repenting, his journal records his pride in the amount of damage that he
was able to inflict upon the Jews: “After this retreat from Judah,
Sennacherib commissioned a record, which is preserved in the spectacular
Annals of Sennacherib (the Taylor Prism), which can be seen in the
British Museum. It shows how full of pride Sennacherib’s heart still
was, even if he could not even claim he conquered Jerusalem. ‘I attacked
Hezekiah of Judah who had not subjected himself to me, and took
forty-six fortresses, forts and small cities. I carried away captive
200,150 people, big and small, both male and female, a multitude of
horses, young bulls, asses, camels, and oxen. Hezekiah himself I locked
up in Jerusalem like a bird in its cage. I put up banks against the
city. I separated his cities whose inhabitants I had taken prisoners
from his realm and gave them to Mitiniti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of
Ekron, and Zilbel, king of Gaza and thus diminished his country. And I
added another tax to the one imposed on him earlier.”’ (David Guzik on 2
Kgs. 19; citing Bultema, commentary on Isaiah).<a href="#fn5"
id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>God offers every person a chance to repent and receive
forgiveness</u>. Like Sennacherib, all have sinned and fallen short
(Ecc. 7:20; Ro. 3:23). Like Sennacherib, the wages of our sins are death
(Ro. 6:23). God judged Northern Israel for its many sins. He was also
ready to judge Judah for its many sins. Yet, just as God gave Northern
Israel and Sennacherib many years to repent, He is long-suffering and
does not want to judge sin: “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as
some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to
perish but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9). Because
Hezekiah led Judah to repent and turn from its idolatry, God spared
Judah from the death that it also deserved. Jesus also offers a “free
gift” of salvation for all who repent and make Him their Lord and
Savior: “For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.” (Eph. 2:8-9). If you repent of your sins, He is faithful
to forgive you (1 Jo. 1:9). Is there any sin that you still need to
repent of to receive His forgiveness?</p></li>
<li><p><u>God judges those who reject His mercy and grace</u>. God’s
judgment upon the Jews of Northern Israel and then the Assyrians also
show that He must ultimately judge those who reject His mercy and grace.
Judgment will begin with His people. It will then reach all nonbelievers
as well. “For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of
God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those
who do not obey the gospel of God?” (1 Pet. 4:17). “For after all it is
only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to
give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord
Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming
fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those
who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1:6-8). The
prospect of judgment should cause all believers to warn non-believers to
repent. This includes both prayer and evangelism. You can pray for
non-believers. You can share God’s Word. You can also pay to support and
encourage God’s missionaries. You can also live as an example of God’s
light. How are you fulfilling Jesus’ Great Commission? (Matt.
28:16-20).</p></li>
