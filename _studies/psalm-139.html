<p><u>Introduction</u>: David wrote Psalm 139 when his enemies tried to kill him (Ps. 139:19-22). But the authors of the Psalter placed his psalm amongst the psalms that were mostly written for the post-exile Jews. In the face of those who wanted to kill him, praising God’s abilities and His character allowed David to trust in God’s unseen plans. David’s words also gave encouragement to the post-exile Jews. To this day, they have always faced enemies seeking their destruction. Whenever you face a trial, meditating on God’s abilities and character can also help to grow your trust in His perfect but sometimes unseen plans. These include praising His: (1) omniscience, (2) omnipresence, (3) creation, (4) predestination, (5) love, (6) justice, and (7) Spirit-led guidance.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, David trusted God to search his heart and expose his sins because God is all-knowing and holy. You can also trust and invite God to search your heart because He uses His omniscient power to mold you for His use. <u>Second</u>, David confessed that he could not hide his evil from God because God is omnipresent. But he also knew that he did not need to fear evil because no evil can escape God’s sight. You can also trust God to show you the errors of your ways and protect you because He is omnipresent and perfect. <u>Third</u>, David marveled that the Creator of the universe carefully created him in his mother’s womb. You can also trust God because He carefully and wonderfully created you. <u>Fourth</u>, David professed in faith that God wrote His plan for him in His book before David even took form in his mother’s womb. You can also trust God because He predestined you before you were even an embryo for a special purpose to serve Him. <u>Fifth</u>, David marveled that the Creator of the universe somehow had thoughts for him that were too numerous to count. You can also trust God because He constantly thinks about you, and He deeply loves you. <u>Sixth</u>, after praising God, David turned to God to deal with his enemies. You can also trust God when you are under attack because He is just and fair in His perfect timing. <u>Finally</u>, David turned to God to search his heart and remove his unclean ways so that God could best guide him. You can also turn to the Holy Spirit to examine your heart and expose your sins. Through studying the Word and prayer, you can then trust the Holy Spirit to guide your path.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust in God’s omnipotent power to mold you for His purpose</u>. David began by humbly appealing to His all-knowing God to search his heart to expose his evil and draw him closer to God. “<em>For the music director. A Psalm of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, You have searched me and known me. <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>You know when I sit down and when I get up; You understand my thought from far away. <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>You scrutinize my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. <strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, You know it all. <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You have encircled me behind and in front, and placed Your hand upon me. <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot comprehend it</em>.” (Ps. 139:1-6). “David prayed to Yahweh, understanding that He had personal knowledge of him. Pagans often thought that their gods were hostile or indifferent to men and women; David knew that the true God cared enough to have <strong>searched</strong> and <strong>known</strong> each man and woman. · It’s not just that God knows everything – <em>He knows me.</em> · It’s not just that God is everywhere – <em>He is everywhere with me.</em> · It’s not just that God created everything – <em>He created me.</em>” (David Guzik on Ps. 139:1-6) (emphasis in original).<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Trust in God’s omnipotent love to search out your heart for your every need<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God searches and knows every person’s heart</u>. At the end of his life, David also told Solomon, ‘“know the God of your father, and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind; <em>for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts</em>. If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.” (1 Chr. 28:9). Job made a similar claim, “Does He not see my ways, and count all my steps?” (Job 31:4). God also stated to Samuel ‘“for God does not <em>see</em> as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7b). God also repeated this to Jeremiah, “<em>I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind</em>, to give to each person according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10). Jesus also said this to the Pharisees, “‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but <em>God knows your hearts</em>; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God.”’ (Lk. 16:15). Paul also stated that “and <em>He who searches the hearts</em> knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.” (Ro. 8:27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God also knows your needs before you state them</u>. David declared that God knew his needs before he spoke. “<em><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, You know it all.</em>” (Ps. 139:4). God also told Isaiah that He knows your needs before you speak. “It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will listen.” (Is. 65:24). Jesus made a similar declaration. “So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.” (Matt. 6:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God will also never leave you nor forsake you</u>. David declared that God had encircled him with His protective hand. “<em><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You have encircled me behind and in front, and placed Your hand upon me.</em>” (Ps. 139:5). Because God’s omnipotence is motivated by love, He will be with you wherever you go. “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not be terrified nor dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:9). He will also never leave or forsake you. “And the LORD is the one who is going ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not desert you or abandon you. Do not fear and do not be dismayed.” (Dt. 31:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God’s omnipotent love is beyond our full understanding</u>. God’s thoughts are not our thoughts (Is. 55:8-9). Thus, David said that God’s omnipotent love was too wonderful for him to understand. “<em><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot comprehend it</em>.” (Ps. 139:1-6). Job made a similar confession after initially questioning God. “Who is this who conceals advice without knowledge?’ Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.” (Job 42:3). Any attempt to claim that we can fully understand God’s omnipotent love is foolish arrogance. “Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!” (Ro. 11:33).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God is omnipotent, put your trust in Him</u>. Pride causes many to believe that they know what is best. But it is better to trust your omnipotent Creator than your knowledge. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.” (Prov. 3:5-7).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="omnipresence-you-can-trust-god-because-he-is-omnipresent.-ps.-1397-12."><strong>2. <u>Omnipresence: You Can Trust God Because He is Omnipresent</u>. Ps. 139:7-12.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God is omnipresent</u>. David knew that he could not hide his evil from God. But he also knew that he could trust his omnipresent God to protect him from the evil plans of his enemies. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>If I take up the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will take hold of me. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>If I say, ‘Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, and the light around me will be night,’ <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Even darkness is not dark to You, and the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to You</em>.” (Ps. 139:7-12). “The transition is now made from God’s omniscience to God's omnipresence, ver. 5 having paved the way for it. God’s presence is not to be escaped; his spirit is everywhere. ‘In him we live, and move, and have our being’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>). When Jonah sought to flee from his presence, he only found himself brought more absolutely and more perceptibly into his presence.” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 139:7).<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>No evil can escape God’s eyes</u>. Throughout the Bible, God is declared to be all-knowing, with no evil able to escape His sight. ‘“Can a person hide himself in hiding places so that I do not see him?’ declares the LORD. ‘Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the LORD.”’ (Jer. 23:24). “The eyes of the LORD are in every place, watching the evil and the good.” (Prov. 15:3). “And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.” (Heb. 4:13). “For His eyes are upon the ways of a person, and He sees all his steps. There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of injustice can hide themselves.” (Job 34:21-22). “For the ways of everyone are before the eyes of the LORD, and He observes all his paths.” (Prov. 5:21). This has two implications for believers. First, believers should not delude themselves that they can hide their sins from God. Second, believers should also trust God that no evil plans of the enemy are unknown to Him.</p></li>

<p>Even when you are alone or in a dark place, no evil against you will escape God’s sight<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers His omnipresent light to everyone</u>. Because God is omnipotent and holy, David knew God would protect him. “<em><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>If I say, ‘Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, and the light around me will be night,</em>”’ (Ps. 139:11). Jesus is the light who offers to protect believers from darkness. “Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the Light of the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.”’ (Jo. 8:12). “For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” (Col. 1:13). “This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.” (1 Jo. 1:5). “for you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),” (Eph. 5:8-9). But many sadly fail to understand Jesus’ light. “And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.” (Jo. 1:5).</p></li>

<h2 id="creation-you-can-trust-god-because-he-created-you.-ps.-13913-15."><strong>3. <u>Creation: You Can Trust God Because He Created You</u>. Ps. 139:13-15.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God carefully and wonderfully made you in the womb</u>. David faced enemies who sought to destroy him. But he knew that he could trust God because God made him out of love in his mother’s womb. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>For You created my innermost parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb. <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>I will give thanks to You, because I am awesomely and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and my soul knows it very well. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, and skillfully formed in the depths of the earth</em>;” (Ps. 139:13-15). “Before I could know thee, or aught else, thou hadst a care for me, and didst hide me away as a treasure till thou shouldest see fit to bring me to the light. Thus the Psalmist describes the intimacy which God had with him. In his most secret part—his reins, and in his most secret condition—yet unborn, he was under the control and guardianship of God … We cannot begin too soon to bless our Maker, who began so soon to bless us: even in the act of creation he created reasons for our praising his name, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Who can gaze even upon a model of our anatomy without wonder and awe?” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 139:13-14).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>You can trust in God’s plans for you because He carefully made you<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Your Creator also wants to redeem you</u>. Because God created you, He also wants to redeem you for His use. “This is what the LORD says, He who is your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb: “I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, stretching out the heavens by Myself and spreading out the earth alone,” (Is. 44:24). Thus, you can turn to Him to free you when you are in bondage to sin.</p></li>
<li><p><u>You can trust God because He perfectly made you</u>. Because God carefully created you, you can trust that He knows what is best for you. “Just as you do not know the path of the wind, and how bones are formed in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes everything.” (Ecc. 11:5). This also means that you should not question His plans for you. “But now, LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You our potter, and all of us are the work of Your hand.” (Is. 64:8; 45:9; Jer. 18:6). “On the contrary, who are you, you foolish person, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, ‘Why did you make me like this,’ will it?” Or does the potter not have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one object for honorable use, and another for common use? (Ro. 9:20-21; 1 Cor. 1:25; 2:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God created you, He will finish what He started in you</u>. God’s molding of you did not stop in your mother’s womb. You can trust Him because He is faithful to complete His perfect work in you. “For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work among you will complete it by the day of Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 1:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God carefully creates each person in the womb, abortion is evil in God’s eyes</u>. Some people view a fetus as unworthy of protection. But God carefully declares each fetus to be His “<em>awesomely and wonderfully made</em>” creation (Ps. 139:13-15). God declared that He would judge those who sacrifice children to pagan idols (Lev. 20:4-5). Sacrificing a child because it would be inconvenient is no less offensive to God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God carefully made you, He also deserves your praise</u>. David declared that he would give thanks because God carefully made him for a purpose. “<em><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>I will give thanks to You, because I am awesomely and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works,</em>” (Ps. 139:14). Jesus created all things (1:1-3; Col. 1:16). In heaven, all will bow down and celebrate Jesus for His loving creation. “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” (Rev. 4:11). But you don’t need to wait to thank Him.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>God had a special plan for you before you were an embryo</u>. David had the faith to know that God preordained a special plan for him and wrote it in God’s book before God had even created him in his mother’s womb. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>Your eyes have seen my formless substance; and in Your book were written all the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there was not one of them</em>.” (Ps. 139:16). “Before the embryo had any such form that its future size, shape, or proportions could be marked by the eye of man, it was clearly and distinctly known by God … when yet an embryo, and when nothing could be determined from that by the eye of man as to what I was to be, all the future was known to God, and was written down - just what should be my form and vigor; how long I should live; what I should be; what would be the events of my life.” (Albert Barnes on Ps. 139:16).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/psalm-139/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.34028in;height:3.01042in" alt="Psalm 139:16 You Saw Me Before I Was Born (yellow)" /></p>
<p>Before you were born. God recorded in advance all your great acts of faith in His book<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God loves every person and predestined each believer for a special calling</u>. The enemy whispers in your ears that you are worthless, and that no one loves you. But he is a liar (Jo. 8:44). You can trust that God loves you and will protect you because He carefully made you and planned a special calling for you before your birth. “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10). “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” (Jer. 1:5). “Listen to Me, you islands, and pay attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called Me from the womb; from the body of My mother He named Me.” (Is. 49:1). “But when He who had set me apart even from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace was pleased to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,” (Gal. 1:15-16). “and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.” (Ro. 8:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God gives free will, but He knows in advance your choices</u>. Predestination and free will coexist. God gives every person the free will to accept or reject Him. But He knows in advance the choices that you will make because He is outside of our time. Thus, He planned a special purpose for each believer before each person was born. “In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will,” (Eph. 1:11). Even when things feels out of control, you can therefore trust in His greater plans for you. “The LORD has made everything for its own purpose, even the wicked for the day of evil.” (Prov. 16:4). “And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Ro. 8:28).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="love-you-can-trust-god-because-he-deeply-loves-you.-ps.-13917-18."><strong>5. <u>Love: You Can Trust God Because He Deeply Loves You</u>. Ps. 139:17-18.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Out of love, God constantly thinks about you</u>. David marveled how the Creator could have countless loving thoughts for him. This bolstered his ability to trust God’s unseen plans for him. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>How precious also are Your thoughts for me, God! How vast is the sum of them! <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Were I to count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You</em>.” (Ps. 139:17-18). “[I]f it were not for his precious thoughts of love to us, our reason and our living for ever would, through our sins, prove the occasion of our eternal misery. How should we then delight to meditate on God’s love to sinners in Jesus Christ, the sum of which exceeds all reckoning!” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 139:17-24).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-139/media/image2.jpg" style="width:6.5in;height:3.65625in" alt="Psalms 139:17 KJV Desktop Wallpaper - How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O" /></p>
<p>Trust God because His loving thoughts for you are too numerous to count<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God’s thoughts are constantly focused on your wellbeing</u>. Despite managing the entire universe, God’s intense loving thoughts for you are even greater than a nursing mother’s thoughts for her child. “Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.” (Is. 49:15). “How great are Your works, LORD! Your thoughts are very deep.” (Ps. 92:5). “For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” (Jer. 29:11). “But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not fear; you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows.” (Lk. 12:7). “But even the hairs of your head are all counted.” (Matt. 10:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God loves you so much that He sent His only son to die for your sins</u>. Even when you are in rebellion against God, He still loves you. His love prompted Him to send Jesus to suffer a brutal crucifixion to atone for the sins of any person who would have faith in Him. “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Ro. 5:8). “Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or trouble, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?” (Ro. 8:35). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16).</p></li>

<h2 id="justice-you-can-trust-god-because-he-is-just-and-fair.-ps.-13919-22."><strong>6. <u>Justice: You Can Trust God Because He is Just and Fair</u>. Ps. 139:19-22.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust God to be just and fair and avenge the wrongs against you in His timing</u>. Rather than seeking personal vengeance, David turned to God for justice against those who tried to kill him. His enemies rejected God’s divine anointing for David to be king. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>If only You would put the wicked to death, God; leave me, you men of bloodshed. <strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>For they speak against You wickedly, and Your enemies take Your name in vain. <strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Do I not hate those who hate You, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>I hate them with the utmost hatred; they have become my enemies</em>.” (Ps. 139:19-22). “David prays for God to slay the wicked in Ps 139:19a, warning the men of blood to turn away from him in 139:19b. In verse 20 David describes the idolaters as those who do precisely as depicted in 2:1-3-scheme against Yahweh (139:20a). Their idolatrous character can be seen not only from the fact of their being called God’s enemies but also from the fact that they ‘lift up to enemies’ (139:20b). The Pss 2, 110, and 137 theme continues in verse 21, where David professes his emotional identification with Yahweh: asserting that he hates those who hate Yahweh and loathes those who rise against him. The Bible and devotion to Yahweh have shaped David’s emotions, and when he says in verse 22 that he hates his enemies with complete hatred, we should not be troubled but instructed that ‘friendship with the world is enmity toward God’ (Jas 4:4). Thus David says at the end of Ps 139:22, ‘As those at enmity they are to me.” (James Hamilton on Ps. 139:19-22).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>No unrepentant evil can escape God’s judgment</u>. Because God is omnipresent and holy, He will one day judge all unrepentant evil. “For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.” (Ecc. 12:14). “Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, and whose deeds are done in a dark place, and they say, ‘Who sees us?’ or ‘Who knows us?”’ (Is. 29:15). “Though they dig into Sheol, from there My hand will take them; and though they ascend to heaven, from there I will bring them down. And though they hide on the summit of Carmel, I will track them down and take them from there; and though they hide themselves from My sight on the bottom of the sea, I will command the serpent from there, and it will bite them.” (Amos 9:2-3). Thus, you can trust God to decide who needs to be judged and to right all wrongs.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Because God is omnipresent, you don’t need to fear evil</u>. Because God will judge unrepentant evil, you can also leave vengeance to Him. “So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.” (Matt. 10:26). “And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.” (Heb. 4:13). “Vengeance is Mine, and retribution; in due time their foot will slip. For the day of their disaster is near, and the impending things are hurrying to them.” (Dt. 32:35). “Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written: ‘vengeance is mine, I will repay,’ says the Lord.” (Ro. 12:19). “For we know Him who said, ‘vengeance is mine, I will repay.’ And again, ‘The Lord will judge His people.”’ (Heb. 10:30).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Pray for your enemies to repent to avoid judgment</u>. God judges sinners in His perfect timing to give every person a chance to repent and turn to Him (2 Pet. 3:9). To convict sinners, believers are called upon to pray for them and show them God’s love. “But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” (Matt. 5:44; Lk. 6:27-28). “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.” (Ro. 12:14). “not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you would inherit a blessing.” (1 Pet. 3:9; 1 Thess. 5:15).</p></li>

Ps. 139:23-24.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust God to test you, correct you, and restore you on the right path</u>. To save him from the wrong path, David invited God to search his heart, test him, convict him, and then restore him to God’s intended path of righteousness. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test and know my anxious thoughts; <strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>and see if there is any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way</em>.” (Ps. 139:23-24). “In addition to his request ‘search me’ and ‘know my heart,’ he adds the prayer ‘test me’ (<span dir="rtl">בְּ֝חָנֵ֗נִי</span>). The word means ‘to examine’ in order to discover any spiritual weaknesses in him. Just as one would refine a metal to remove impurities, so God should test his life for impurities … His final request is to be guided (which he earlier described as God’s work wherever he might be) in the ‘everlasting way.’ This expression refers to the right way of living that will endure. It is comparable to seeking first the kingdom of God and its righteousness. It is the course of life that results in rest and blessings, but which if abandoned results in destruction (cf. Ps. 1:6; Jer. 6:16; 18:8). (Allen Ross on Ps. 139:23-24).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Be humble before God and do not act on your own understanding</u>. David showed profound humility when he asked God to search out his heart, test him, and mold him. He knew that his own understanding would lead to his destruction. “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks wisely will be delivered.” (Prov. 28:26). In everything you do, have the humility to pray for the Holy Spirit to guide you.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God tests you to show you where your heart needs correction</u>. God cannot tempt you (Jam. 1:13-14). He does, however, test you to humble you and to show you where your focus is on the wrong things: “He might humble you, <em>testing you</em>, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.” (Dt. 8:2). “[F]or God has come in order to <em>test you</em>, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin.” (Ex. 20:20(b)). “I, the Lord, search the heart, <em>I test the mind</em>, . . .” (Jer. 17:10; 20:12). “<em>The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked</em> . . .” (Ps. 11:5; 66:10). He tests you to show you where your heart is evil (Jer. 17:9). Even though David was an adulterer and a murder, he showed that he had learned from God’s mercy and grace by inviting God to search his heart to expose his remaining hidden sins “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>Search me, God, and know my heart; put me to the test..</em>” (Ps. 139:23). Despite his horrible sins, his openness to learning from his sins is what made him a man after God’s heart (Acts 13:22). Are you willing to let God show you your hidden sins and change your ways?</p></li>

<p>Turn to God to search your heart for sin and correct your path<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>God frequently tests your heart through trials</u>. Most people don’t want a trial. There is often pain, sorrow, and apprehension. Believers frequently expect God to shield them from a trial. But our thoughts are not His thoughts (Is. 55:8). Even when a trial makes no sense, He wants you to look for the good in the trial because they are opportunities for you or others to grow in your walk with Him: “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,” (Jam. 1:2; Ro. 12:2). If you say to God that there is no need for Him to test you because you are not a sinner, His truth is not within you (1 Jo. 1:8).</p></li>
<li><p><u>God searches your heart out of love to guide you</u>. Jesus also searches your heart to be able to intercede for you. “and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.” (Ro. 8:27). “For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among people knows the thoughts of a person except the spirit of the person that is in him? So also the thoughts of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.” (1 Cor. 2:10-11). Thus, you should invite Jesus to search your heart.</p></li>
<li><p><u>God cares what motivates you, not what you look like or your worldly success</u>. Many people value themselves or others based upon their appearance, their worldly successes, or their wealth. But God does not value these things. Instead, He searches your heart because He desires from you a heart that is devoted to Him. “God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7). “All the ways of a person are clean in his own sight, but the LORD examines the motives.” (Prov. 16:2). “And [Jesus] said to them, ‘You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but God knows your hearts; because that which is highly esteemed among people is detestable in the sight of God.”’ (Lk. 16:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Let God’s Word guide your path through study and prayer</u>. David prayed for God to “<em>lead me in the everlasting way</em>.” (Ps. 139:24). The Psalms make clear that God’s Word sets forth the path for believers to stay on “<strong><sup>105 </sup></strong><em>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</em>” (Ps. 119:105). “For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and rebukes for discipline are the way of life” (Prov. 6:23). “And so we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts.” (2 Pet. 1:19). God will apply His Word to your life when you study it and pray for His wisdom (Jam. 1:5-6). “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, <em>He will guide you into all the truth</em>; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.” (Jo. 16:13). Are you regularly studying the Word and praying for the Holy Spirit to apply it to your life?</p></li>
<li><p><u>The path that God offers includes everlasting life through Jesus</u>. David asked for God to keep Him on the path leading to “<em>the everlasting way</em>.” (Ps. 139:24). David and other psalmists similar requests. “LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make Your way straight before me.” (Ps. 5:8). “Make me know Your ways, LORD; teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day.” (Ps. 25:4-5). “Teach me Your way, LORD; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.” (Ps. 86:11). “Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.” (Ps. 143:10). The way that Jesus offers is narrow and is goes through Him. “I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.” (Jo. 10:9). “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14). “Strive to enter through the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.” (Lk. 13:24). This is a path that leads both to eternal life and Spirit-led fulfillment. “Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, ‘This is the way, walk in it,’ whenever you turn to the right or to the left.” (Is. 30:21). But many sadly refuse to walk down Jesus’ narrow path. “This is what the LORD says: ‘Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find a resting place for your souls. But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’” (Jer. 6:16).</p></li>
