<p><u>Introduction</u>: Psalm 110 is so important to Christian theology that it is frequently cited as “proof of the plurality of the Godhead and Jesus’ supremacy as king, priest, and Messiah. For this reason, Psalm 110 is ‘the most frequently quoted or referenced psalm in the New Testament.”’<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Even Jesus quoted from this psalm as proof of His divine authority (Matt. 22:43-44; Mk. 12:36; Lk. 20:42-44). Thus, this psalm is worth studying. Here, David makes seven prophetic revelations about the future Messiah. The Messiah, whom the New Testament reveals to be Jesus Christ, (1) is seated as the right hand of God the Father as His co-equal, (2) has full dominion and authority over all creation, (3) will have believers who voluntarily respond and serve Him, (4) is the means for our atonement and our faithful intercessor, (5) He is our deliverer, (6) our fair and just ruler, and (7) He will be glorified as King of Kings in heaven.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, David quoted Yahweh as telling David’s Lord to “<em>Sit at My right hand</em>.” Jesus, Peter, and the author of Hebrews all quoted this verse to establish Jesus’ divine authority. <u>Second</u>, David proclaimed that the Messiah will “<em>Rule in the midst of Your enemies</em>.”’ Jesus is the sovereign ruler over all creation. <u>Third</u>, David declared that the Messiah’s “<em>people will volunteer freely on the day of Your power; in holy splendor.</em>” Jesus’ followers will freely submit to their Master. <u>Fourth</u>, David revealed that the Messiah will also be ‘“<em>a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek</em>.’” As High Priest, Jesus provides the means for your atonement, the assurance of your salvation, and He acts as your intercessor. <u>Fifth</u>, David promised that “<em>He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath</em>.” Jesus will also deliver you from evil. <u>Sixth</u>, David also foretold of Jesus’ just and righteous reign: “<em>He will judge among the nations,</em>” He will defeat evil, and His believers will dwell in peace. <u>Finally</u>, after the Messiah’s suffering, David says that: “<em>He will lift up His head</em>.” After Jesus comes again to judge evil, He will receive the glory as King of Kings.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus Christ and God the Father are part of the same triune God</u>. David began this famous psalm by describing Yahweh’s grant of divine authority to David’s “Lord”: “<em>A Psalm of David. <strong><sup>1</sup></strong> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says to my Lord</em>: <em>Sit at My right hand . . .</em>” (Ps. 110:1a). Some allege that David did not write this psalm. But Jesus Himself verified David to be the author (Matt. 22:43). And the entire psalm foretells the promised Messiah, Jesus Christ: “This psalm is pure gospel; it is only, and wholly, concerning Christ, the Messiah promised to the fathers and expected by them . . . Of him therefore, no doubt, the prophet here speaks of him and of no other man. Christ, as our Redeemer, executes the office of a prophet, of a priest, and of a king, with reference both to his humiliation and his exaltation; and of each of these we have here an account.” (Matthew Henry on Ps. 110).<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>David revealed God’s triune nature</u>. In this first verse, David made a profound revelation about the nature of God when he referred to Yahweh talking to “<em>Adoni”</em> (<span dir="rtl">אדוני</span>) (“my Lord”). In the context of one person greeting another, the term <em>Adoni</em> (<span dir="rtl">אדוני</span>) is frequently used as a term of respect. Thus, some scholars argue that “David was directing this oracle from Yahweh to a human lord, not to the divine messianic Lord.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But the remainder of this important psalm makes claims about David’s Lord that simply could not apply to any human authority. Simply put, no human has ever sat at the right hand of Yahweh, as verse one clearly states: “<em>Sit at My right hand . . .</em>” (Ps. 110:1b). Moreover, when used in the context of angelic beings, the term “<em>Adoni</em>” (<span dir="rtl">אדוני</span>) has a Messianic implication. For example, Joshua used the term “<em>Adoni”</em> (<span dir="rtl">אדוני</span>) as Yahweh (“the LORD”), when Jesus made a likely pre-incarnate appearance (Josh. 6:2).<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As another example, when Gideon met the angel of the Lord, another likely pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus, he also referred to the angel as “<em>Adoni</em>” (<span dir="rtl">אדוני</span>) (Jdgs. 6:12-15). Thus, although David could not have fully understood what he wrote, He revealed God’s triune nature. After Thomas saw the holes in the hands of the resurrected Jesus, he used this term to declare Jesus to be God: “Thomas answered and said to Him, ‘<em>My Lord and my God</em>!’” (Jo. 20:28). Jesus also wants you to submit and declare Him as your Lord and your God.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus also could not have been a different God</u>. God the Father also could not have spoken to Jesus as a different God. He certified that there is no other God besides Him: ‘“ . . . <em>Is there any God besides Me, or is there any other Rock? I know of none</em>.’” (Is. 44:8b). “. . . He is God; <em>there is no other besides Him</em>. . . . He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; <em>there is no other</em>.” (Dt. 4:35b, 39b). Moses also declared in the “<em>Shema</em>”: “Hear, Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is <em>one</em>!” (Dt. 6:4). In Hebrew, this reads: “<em>Shema Yis'ra'eil Adonai Elohiym Adonai echad.”</em>  (Dt. 6:4). The Hebrew word <em>echod</em> or “one” is also translated as a “union,” “composite one” or a “cluster.” <em>Ehod</em> is also used in Genesis to describe the union of a man and a woman as “one” flesh  (Gen. 2:25).  Likewise, the word <em>echod</em> is used to describe the “single cluster” of grapes that the Hebrew spies brought back from Israel  (Nu. 13:23). Thus, we worship God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit together a single Triune God where each is vital to our salvation. “In the New Testament, we have the full revelation, however, it clarifies that this king is the divine Son of God; and there can be no work of God in which all persons of the Godhead are not present and actively involved. For the Son to defeat His enemies is for God the Father to defeat the enemies. The power and authority comes from the Son, who submits to the Father; the working out of the plan is through the agency of the Son, by the power of the Spirit.” (Allen Ross on Ps. 110).<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus emptied Himself of His divine grandeur to become our sacrifice and our Messiah</u>. Jesus also quoted David’s Psalm 110:1 to prove that He was more than just a human descendant of David: “Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question: ‘What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?’ They said to Him, ‘The son of David.’ He said to them, ‘Then how does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying, ‘<em>The Lord said to My Lord, ‘Sit at My right hand, until I put your enemies under Your feet</em>’ Therefore, if David calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?”’ (Matt. 22:41-5; Mk. 12:35–37; Lk. 20:41–44). Peter also quoted Psalm 110:1 to prove that Jesus is the Messiah, who is seated at the Father’s right hand following His ascension to heaven: “Therefore, since He has been exalted at the right hand of God, and has received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear. For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: ‘<em>The Lord said to My Lord, ‘Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.</em>’ Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified.”’ (Acts 2:33-36). The author of Hebrews further quoted Psalm 110:1 to prove that Jesus the Messiah is also greater than any angel: “But to which of the angels has He ever said, ‘<em>Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for Your feet</em>”? (Heb. 1:13). Thus, Jesus is God, who became human to die for our sins. He then ascended to His throne in heaven.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the Messiah and heir to God’s Covenant with David</u>.  God promised David an eternal dynasty:  “Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.”’ (2 Sam. 7:16).  Daniel repeated this promise:  “But the saints of the Highest One will receive the kingdom and take possession of the kingdom forever, for all ages to come.’”  (Dan. 7:18).  Jesus was born into the line of David (Matt. 1:1).  He came to fulfill God’s covenant with David as the eternal King of Kings:  “He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”  (Lk. 1:33; Rev. 19:16).  If you have faith, you can also give thanks that you will one day live under His righteous reign.</p></li>

<h2 id="sovereign-jesus-is-the-sovereign-ruler-over-all-creation.-ps.-1101b-2."><strong>2. <u>Sovereign: Jesus is the Sovereign Ruler Over All Creation</u>. Ps. 110:1b-2.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus Christ is sovereign over all, including evil</u>. David further revealed that the Messiah will assume His place at God’s right hand to exercise full dominion over God’s enemies: “‘ <em>. . . until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.’ <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will stretch out Your strong scepter from Zion, saying, ‘Rule in the midst of Your enemies</em>.’” (Ps. 110:1b -2). The Messiah will have authority over the nations. No evil can withstand His will.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has dominion and authority over the devil and all his evil kingdoms</u>. These verses point to the promised Messiah, who will destroy the devil: “Both the ‘trampling’ of enemies in Ps. 108:13 (MT 108:14) and the putting of the enemies under the foot in 110:1 interpret Gen. 3:15. The serpent was told of the seed of the woman would bruise his head and that he would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15). This appears to be interpreted to mean the process of stomping on the head of the serpent, the seed of the woman would have his heel injured, giving rise to the imagery across the Old Testament of enemies being put under foot . . . Genesis 49:10 asserted that the ‘scepter’ (<span dir="rtl">שרביט</span>) would not depart from Judah. Numbers 24:17 foretold that a king would arise as a ‘scepter’ (<span dir="rtl">שרביט</span>) from Israel to crush the heads of her cursed enemies (2:2), that he would shatter the nations with an iron ‘scepter’ (<span dir="rtl">שרביט</span>). The culmination of these hopes comes in Ps. 110:2 when, using a synonym for ‘scepter / rod,’ David says that Yahweh will send the ‘rod’ (<span dir="rtl">מוט</span>) of His power forth from Zion.” (James M. Hamilton on Ps. 110:1-2).<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will rule from Jerusalem during the Millennial Reign</u>. David also revealed that the Messiah will rule with His “<em>strong scepter from Zion</em>.” (Ps. 110:2). “Then He will speak to them in His anger and terrify them in His fury, saying, ‘But as for Me, I have installed My King upon Zion, My holy mountain.”’  (Ps. 2:5-6).  Other prophecies also state that the Messiah will one day reign from Mount Zion:  “Then the moon will be ashamed and the sun be put to shame, <em>for the LORD of armies will reign on Mount Zion</em> and in Jerusalem, and His glory will be before His elders.”  (Is. 24:23).  The wicked will also one day bow before Him:  “The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you, and all those who despised you will bow down at the soles of your feet; and they will call you the city of the LORD, <em>the Zion of the Holy One of Israel</em>.”  (Is. 60:14). The future Messianic ruler on Mount Zion is none other than Jesus Christ:  “But You have come to <em>Mount Zion</em> and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,”  (Heb. 12:22).  “Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.”  (Rev. 14:1).  Thus, you can give thanks that Jesus has won the battle. </p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus has full authority over the nations</u>.  Jesus reigns forever with full authority over the nations:  “The Father loves the Son and has entrusted all things to His hand.” (Jo. 3:35). “For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.”  (Jo. 5:22). “Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity.” (Ps. 93:2). “And to Him was given dominion, Honor, and a kingdom, so that all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages Might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion Which will not pass away; and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed.” (Dan. 7:14). “Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.”  (Rev. 11:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The devil has no power in the face of Jesus</u>.  The devil tries to deceive us into thinking that he is just as powerful as God.  But he has no power to snatch believers from Jesus: “and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.  My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.”  (Jo. 10:28-29).  Satan’s rebellion is also doomed.  He and his demons will be thrown into the lake of eternal fire (Rev. 20:15). </p></li>

<h2 id="submission-jesus-followers-will-freely-submit-to-their-master.-ps.-1103."><strong>3. <u>Submission: Jesus’ Followers Will Freely Submit to Their Master</u>. Ps. 110:3.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ believers will voluntarily submit and serve Him</u>. Those who understand that Jesus died on the cross to free them from eternal death will gladly submit and serve Him: “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>Your people will volunteer freely on the day of Your power; in holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, Your youth are to You as the dew</em>.” (Ps. 110:3). “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. In the full sense of the word, Messiah can only <strong>rule</strong> over ‘willing’ hearts. In the day of his power, His people will offer themselves gladly to be his soldiers and servants, and flock to His banner, as the Israelites to that of Deborah and Barak, when ‘the people willingly offered themselves’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-2.htm">Judges 5:2, 9</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19-23</a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Ps. 110:3).<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sheep will voluntarily respond to Him</u>. Jesus does not coerce people to follow Him. Instead, His servants will hear His voice and will gladly follow Him: “When he puts all his own sheep outside, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice . . . I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me, . . . My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;” (Jo. 10:4, 27). If Jesus has called you, are you responding to His calling without delay?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ sheep will serve Him out of love</u>. When the Apostle Paul had the scales on his eyes removed, he called himself a “bondservant” for Jesus: “Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,” (Ro. 1:1). A bond servant was a freed slave who voluntarily chose to stay with his or her master. Paul knew that he was freed from bondage. But he chose to stay and voluntarily serve his new master Jesus. Paul also urged believers to present themselves as a “living sacrifice” for their master Jesus: “Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.” (Ro. 12:1). Are you a living sacrifice for Jesus?</p></li>
<li><p><u>Submit to Jesus with reverence and faith</u>.  David also described the Messiah’s followers as worshiping Him “<em>in holy splendor.</em>” (Ps. 110:3). This implied that they will approach the Messiah with the reverence that He deserves. Other psalms are also filled with proclamations of reverent fear for God:  “My flesh trembles from the fear of You, and I am afraid of Your judgments.”  (Ps. 119:120).  Through Isaiah, God declared that He desires a humble and contrite spirit from us:  ‘“For My hand made all these things, so all these things came into being,’ declares the LORD.  ‘But I will look to this one, at one who is humble and contrite in spirit, and who trembles at My word.”’  (Is. 66:2).  “‘Do you not fear Me?’ declares the LORD.  ‘Do you not tremble in My presence?  For I have placed the sand as a boundary for the sea, an eternal limit, and it will not cross over it. Though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they will not cross over it.” (Jer. 5:22).  Fearing God is defined as hating what God calls evil:  “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverted mouth, I hate.”  (Prov. 8:13).  If you don’t accept God’s definition of evil, you cannot claim to fear Him.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus is your faithful High Priest for all eternity</u>. Jewish kings could not also serve as High Priest. But the Messiah will serve both as King of Kings and the faithful High Priest according to the ancient order of Melchizedek. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has sworn and will not change His mind, ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek</em>.’” (Ps. 110:4). After Abraham’s victory in rescuing Lot in battle, he met Melchizedek, who was both King of Salem (ancient Jerusalem) and the High Priest of God the Most High.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> His name (<span dir="rtl">מלכי־צדק</span>) meant “King of Righteousness,” a foreshadow of Jesus.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Here, the reference to the King also being a priest precludes this from being any human Jewish king. God punished both Saul and Uzziah when they assumed both roles (e.g., 1 Sam. 13:13-14; 2 Chr. 26:4): “The subject is THE PRIEST KING. None of the kings of Israel united these two offices, though some endeavored to do so. Although David performed some acts which appeared to verge upon the priestly, yet he was no priest, but of the tribe of Judah, ‘of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood’; and he was far too devout a man to thrust himself into that office uncalled. The Priest King here spoken of is David’s Lord, a mysterious personage typified by Melchizedek, and looked for by the Jews as the Messiah. He is none other than the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 110).<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>As High Priest, Jesus provided the means for both atonement and salvation</u>. In Old Testament times, a priest provided a sinner with the means for atonement through a blood sacrifice. The author of Hebrews connected David’s description of the Messiah to reveal that He also became the means for our atonement: “<strong><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm"><sup>5</sup></a></strong> So too Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a high priest, . . . <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></a> just as He also says in another passage, ‘<em>You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek’</em>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></a>In the days of His humanity, He offered up both prayers and pleas with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His devout behavior. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></a>Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-9.htm"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></a>And <em>having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey Him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-10.htm"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></a>being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek</em>.” (Heb. 5:5-10). “[B]ut He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time onward until <em>His enemies are made a footstool for His feet</em>. For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.” (Heb. 10:12-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>As High Priest, Jesus is also faithful to provide the assurance of your eternal salvation</u>. David assured that: “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has sworn and will not change His mind,</em>” (Ps. 110:4). “Verse 4 first provides a new introduction to an oracle of God. The speaker assures us that Yahweh’s statement is guaranteed by a declaration that is irrevocable and sworn.”<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> As our ancient High Priest, Jesus faithfully provides believers with the guarantee of eternal salvation: “<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></a>But, beloved, <em>we are convinced of better things regarding you, and things that accompany salvation</em>, even though we are speaking in this way . . .   <sup><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm"><strong>19</strong></a></sup> <em>This hope we have as an anchor of the soul</em>, a hope both sure and reliable and one which enters within the veil, <em><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></a>where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek</em>.” (Heb. 6:9, 19- 20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>As High Priest, Jesus also knows your struggles and can show you compassion</u>. Even though Jesus is God, He emptied Himself of His divine grandeur to become a human and suffer for mankind (Phil. 2:5-7). Thus, He knows your pains, and He is filled with love and compassion for you: “Therefore, since <em>we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God</em>, let’s hold firmly to our confession. For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.” (Heb. 4:14-15). Thus, you can cry out to Jesus, and He will show you compassion when you are brokenhearted.</p></li>
<li><p><u>As High Priest, Jesus is also your eternal intercessor</u>. Unlike the Aaronic priests, Jesus’ priesthood will never end, and He continually intercedes for you: “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>For it is attested of Him, ‘<em>You are a priest forever</em> <em>according to the order of Melchizedek</em>.’ . . . <strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>by the same extent Jesus also has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <strong><sup>23</sup></strong> The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing; <strong><sup>24</sup></strong> Jesus, on the other hand, because <em>He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently</em>. <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Therefore He is also able to save forever those who come to God through Him, since <em>He always lives to make intercession for them</em>.” (Heb. 7:15-25). He intercedes for you because He is filled with love for you (Ro. 8:26-27).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus has become both your High Priest and King of Kings</u>. Hebrews also cites to Psalm 110 to assert that Jesus has assumed for all eternity the roles of both High Priest and King of Kings: “Now the main point in what has been said is this: <em>we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens</em>,” (Heb. 8:1). “So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.” (Mk. 16:19). “But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” (Lk. 22:69). He has unified all authority under Him, and He will reign with holy righteousness.</p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-110/media/image4.jpg" style="width:5.69271in;height:1.71167in" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will use His omnipotent power to free His people</u>. Jesus is not a remote and uninterested God in heaven. Instead, He will use His divine power to deliver His people: “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath</em>.” (Ps. 110:5). In the end times, He will shatter those who rebel against Him:  “Ask it of Me, and I will certainly give the nations as Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as Your possession.  You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.’”  (Ps. 2:8-9). Thus, believers are called upon to warn sinners to repent.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will use His power seated at God the Father’s right hand to deliver you</u>. Jesus also referred to Psalm 110:5 to establish that He will one day use His omnipotent power to shatter the evil that oppresses His people: “Jesus said to him, ‘You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see <em>the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power</em>, and coming on the clouds of heaven.” (Matt. 22:64). This will also fulfill Daniel’s prophecy regarding the Messiah’s triumphant return: “I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven One like a son of man was coming, and He came up to the Ancient of Days And was presented before Him.” (Dan. 7:13). Thus, you can rest in the assurance that Jesus has won. The devil’s days are numbered.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus the Messiah is currently seated at God the Father’s right hand to deliver you</u>.<br />
The Apostle Paul also quoted from Psalm 110 and Psalm 8:6 to prove that Jesus uses His heavenly power to defeat the enemy, to save us, and to intercede for us: “For He must reign until <em>He has put all His enemies under His feet</em>. The last enemy that will be abolished is death. For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, ‘<em>All things are put in subjection</em>,’ it is clear that this excludes the Father who put all things in subjection to Him. When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all. (1 Cor. 15:25-28). “And <em>He put all things in subjection under His feet</em>, and made Him head over all things to the church,” (Eph. 1:22). Jesus suffered a brutal death to deliver you from death (Jo. 3:16). Thus, He deserves your full submission and gratitude.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will judge those who rebel against Him</u>.  David warned of the Messiah’s judgment against the rulers who rebel against Him:  “<em>The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath</em>.”  (Ps. 110:5).  Samuel also foretold of God’s judgment upon the nations:  “Those who contend with the LORD will be terrified; against them He will thunder in the heavens, the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed.”  (1 Sam. 2:10). Just as David prophesied, Jesus will one day shatter the nations who oppose Him:  “And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, <em>as the vessels of the Potter are shattered</em>, as I also have received authority from My Father;”  (Rev. 2:27).  “From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.”  (Rev. 19:15). Every Word in the Bible will come true.  The countless fulfilled prophecies should give every person who rejects Jesus and the authority of His Word reason to fear.</p></li>
<li><p><u>The Jews’ enemies will fear Jesus’ power</u>.  Those who oppose God’s peoples are subject to the curse that God promised to Abraham  (Gen. 12:3).  The nations who see His power have experienced fear:  “Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; the leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away. Terror and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone; until Your people pass over, O LORD, until the people pass over whom You have purchased.”  (Ex. 15:15-16).  “<sup>10 </sup>So all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and they will be afraid of you.”  (Dt. 28:10).  “And many among the peoples of the land became Jews, because the dread of the Jews had fallen on them.”  (Esther 8:17b; 9:2).  “It will be to Me a name of joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.”  (Jer. 33:9; Is. 31:9).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Call upon Jesus when you need deliverance</u>. When you are in bondage, call upon Jesus to deliver you: “The LORD is my rock and my fortress and <em>my deliverer</em>, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” (Ps. 18:2, 31, 46; 19:14). “My faithfulness and <em>my fortress, my stronghold and my savior, my shield and He in whom I take refuge, who subdues my people under me</em>.” (Ps. 144:2). “May those who are enemies of my soul be put to shame and consumed; may they be covered with disgrace and dishonor, who seek to injure me.”  (Ps. 71:13). “My tongue also will tell of Your righteousness all day long; for they are put to shame, for they are humiliated who seek my harm.”  (Ps. 71:24).  “All my enemies will be put to shame and greatly horrified; they shall turn back, they will suddenly be put to shame.” (Ps. 6:10).  “May those be ashamed and humiliated together who seek my life to destroy it; may those be turned back and dishonored who delight in my hurt.”  (Ps. 40:14).  </p></li>
<li><p><u>Praise Jesus when He delivers you</u>.  The Psalms also remind believers to give thanks for their deliverance:  “The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,”  (2 Sam. 22:47). “My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my savior, You save me from violence.”  (2 Sam. 22:3). “The Rock!  His work is perfect, for all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He.”  (Dt. 32:4).  Do you praise Jesus for delivering you and protecting you?</p></li>

<p>Jesus, the Deliverer, forms the central verse of seven psalms (Ps. 107-113)<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="justice-jesus-will-reign-as-a-just-ruler-and-bring-eternal-peace.-ps.-1106."><strong>6. <u>Justice: Jesus Will Reign as a Just Ruler and Bring Eternal Peace</u>. Ps. 110:6.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign as a just King of Kings</u>. David also foretold of the Messiah’s future perfect and just reign: “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>He will judge among the nations, He will fill them with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country</em>.” (Ps. 110:6). “Your throne, God, is forever and ever; <em>the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice</em>.” (Ps. 45:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reign with justice and righteousness</u>.  Psalm 110:6 speaks to God’s judgment of the unrighteous. “This seems to anticipate the slaughter at the Battle of Armageddon (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Revelation+16.16&amp;t=NKJV">Revelation 16:16</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Revelation+19.11-21&amp;t=NKJV">19:11-21</a>).” (David Guzik on Ps. 110:6).<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> A just God must judge evil. But justice is more than punishment. After defeating evil, Jesus will then rule with righteousness and peace:  “For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.  There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore.” (Is. 9:6-7; 16:5).  ‘“Behold, the days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in the land.”’  (Jer. 23:5; Is. 24:15; 42:4; Zech. 9:9-10).  The end to all injustice and evil is another reason to praise and worship Him.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bring peace with His perfect reign</u>. Jesus will be called the “Prince of Peace” (Is. 9:6-7) because He will end all conflicts: “He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.” (Ps. 46:9). “And He will judge between the nations, and will mediate for many peoples; and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning knives. Nation will not lift up a sword against nation, and never again will they learn war.” (Is. 2:4). Thus, you have many reasons to praise Jesus and thank Him for what He has prepared.</p></li>

<h2 id="glory-after-suffering-jesus-will-be-glorified-in-heaven.-ps.-1107."><strong>7. <u>Glory: After Suffering, Jesus Will Be Glorified in Heaven</u>. Ps. 110:7.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will one day be honored</u>. After Jesus suffered for us, He will be honored and glorified in heaven: “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>He will drink from the brook by the wayside; therefore He will lift up His head</em>.” (Ps. 110:7). “Jesus was exalted because of his sufferings; therefore did <em>he lift up his head, </em><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>.” (Benson Commentary on Ps. 110:7).<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> In heaven, He will also raise the heads of His believers: “His own head shall be lifted high in victory, and his people, in him, shall be upraised also.” (Charles Spurgeon on Ps. 110:7).<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/psalm-110/media/image3.jpg" style="width:5.88542in;height:3.56479in" alt="king of kings | walkworthy.org" /></p>
<p>Jesus has traded His crown of thorns for His crown of glory<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus revealed His glory on Earth, but many failed to understand it</u>.  God’s glory was revealed through Jesus Christ: “And the Word became flesh  . . .  and <em>we saw His glory</em>, glory as the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”  (Jo. 1:14).  But only those with faith could see that Jesus was the light of the world (Jo. 8:12).  Most could not comprehend His light because they loved evil (Jo. 3:19).  “in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that <em>they will not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ</em>, who is the image of God.”  (2 Cor. 4:4).  Thus, they crucified Him:  “the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified <em>the Lord of glory</em>;”  (1 Cor. 2:8). Jesus suffered as He drank our judgment “<em>from the brook by the wayside;</em>” (Ps. 110:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reveal His full glory to all in heaven</u>.  After Jesus returns, His Shekinah glory will again be present in the Temple (Micah 4:1-8; Zech. 14:3-9).  In heaven, you will also see His Shekinah glory without the need for a veil  (1 Jo. 3:2).  You “<em>will see His face. . . [and] the Light of God (“Shekinah glory”) will illumine them forever and ever</em>.”  (Rev. 22:5).  “And <em>He is the radiance of His glory</em> and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.  When He had made purification of sins, <em>He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</em>,”  (Heb. 1:3).  “LORD, I love the dwelling of Your house, and the place <em>where Your glory remains</em>.”  (Ps. 26:8).  “Be exalted above the heavens, God; may <em>Your glory be above all the earth</em>.”  (Ps. 57:11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will also lift the heads of His believers</u>.  Jesus will also share His glory with believers in heaven: “But You, LORD, are a shield around me, <em>my glory, and the One who lifts my head</em>.” (Ps. 3:3). Believers will then shout for joy to praise their High Priest and King of Kings: “But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, sing for joy forever!  And may You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.”  (Ps. 5:11).  “For the music director.  A Psalm of David.  In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee as a bird to your mountain?”’  (Ps. 11:1). “Taste and see that the LORD is good; how blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!” (Ps. 34:8).  Solomon also promised blessings for those who put their trust in God:  “One who pays attention to the word will find good, and blessed is one who trusts in the LORD.” (Prov. 16:20).  “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose trust is the LORD.”  (Jer. 17:7). Thus, you have many reasons to praise Jesus and give thanks.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Worship the King of Glory</u>.  One of the best worship songs for the King of Glory is the song “Hosanna” from New Zealand singer and songwriter Brooke Gabrielle Fraser Ligertwood: “Come on, we sing, I see the King of glory coming on the clouds with fire, the whole Earth shakes, the whole Earth shakes, Yeah, I see His love and mercy, washing over all our sin, the people sing , the people sing, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, I see a generation, rising up to take their place, with selfless faith, with selfless faith, I see a near revival, stirring as we pray and seek, we’re on our knees, we’re on our knees, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest , Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Heal my heart and make it clean, open up my eyes to the things unseen, show me how to love like You have loved me , break my heart for what breaks Yours , everything I am for Your kingdom’s cause as I walk from Earth into eternity, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the Highest . . .”</p></li>
