<p><u>Introduction</u>: Here, Solomon revealed the importance of living out Yahweh’s wisdom. The New Testament reveals that our God-given wisdom comes through faith in Jesus (1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 2:3; Eph. 1:17). Through the whole counsel of God, Solomon’s proverbs provide lessons for living out Jesus’ revealed wisdom. These include: (1) laboring for Jesus, (2) truth, (3) trusting Him, (4) discernment, (5) faithfulness, (6) fearing Him, and (7) pursuing His righteousness.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, in verses 1 through 4, Solomon extolled the wisdom of building a house and hard labor. This applies to both your relationships with others and with Jesus. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He wants you to diligently labor for His Church. <u>Second</u>, in verses 5 through 9, Solomon proclaimed how Yahweh’s wisdom is based upon truth. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He also wants you to only speak His truth with love. <u>Third</u>, in verses 10 through 14, Solomon revealed the importance of living out Yahweh’s wisdom by trusting Him. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you also need to place your trust in Him. <u>Fourth</u>, in verses 15 through 17, Solomon stated the importance of testing all things to cling to what is good and to avoid what is evil. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He also wants you to test all things to discern what is good and to avoid what is evil. <u>Fifth</u>, in verses 18 through 25, Solomon gave multiple examples of faithful witnesses to Yahweh. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He also wants you to be a faithful witness in your conduct and by helping others. <u>Sixth</u>, in verses 26 through 29, Solomon returned to the central theme of Proverbs by extolling the importance of fearing Yahweh. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He also wants you to fear Him with reverence and by hating evil. <u>Finally</u>, in verses 30 through 35, Solomon urged believers to pursue Yahweh’s righteousness in your heart and actions. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He also wants you to pursue His righteousness in your heart and actions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Labor in loving devotion as a co-builder of Jesus’ Church</u>. In both family relationships and with Jesus, wise people seek to build up the house that Jesus has given them. “<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> <em>The wise woman builds her house, but the foolish tears it down with her own hands</em>.” (Prov. 14:1). “Christ, who in this book goes by the name of ‘Wisdom’, or the wise woman, builds his house upon himself, the Rock; and all his people on their most holy faith, by means of the ministry of the word, and administration of ordinances: he guides and governs his house, where he is, as a Son in it and over it; and of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, taken care of, and wisely and plentifully provided for: and so Gospel ministers, who are wise to win souls, being well instructed in the kingdom of God; these ‘wise women’ (y), so it is in the original text, or wise virgins; these wise master builders lay the foundation Christ ministerially, and build souls on it; and speak things to the edification of the church and people of God, and the building of them up in faith and holiness;” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 14:1).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus builds His Church and urges believers to be His co-builders</u>. Jesus -- wisdom incarnate -- builds His Church. “Wisdom has built her house, she has carved out her seven pillars;” (Prov. 9:1). “By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; and by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.” (Prov. 24:3-4). But Jesus invites believers to be co-builders. “For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.” (1 Cor. 3:9). “you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 2:5). “According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it. For no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Cor. 3:10-11).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To walk as a laborer for Jesus, walk in His example of integrity</u>. To be an effective laborer for Jesus’ Church, He wants you to be a light to others through your integrity. “<strong><sup>2 </sup></strong><em>One who walks in his uprightness fears the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but one who is devious in his ways despises Him</em>.” (Prov. 14:2). “The antithetical parallel of the proverb contrasts the lifestyles of the pious and the impious by the metaphor of two ways: the straight and the crooked. <em>Those who fear I AM</em> describes people who intrinsically <em>walk</em> (see 1:15; 10:9; cf. as <em>perverse</em>, which is to say, they deviate from <em>I Am</em>’s fixed and prescribed moral order (see 2:15) and are therefore abominable to him (3:32). The plural <em>in their ways</em> suggests the perverse have no fixed path but zigzag according to their lusts. Their ethics betray their religious afflictions … Joseph’s refusal to sin against Potiphar revealed his godly heart (Gen. 39:8-9).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 14:2).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus meant for His people to walk in His righteousness to be a light to the lost</u>. Throughout the Bible, believers are urged to walk with integrity by following Jesus’ Word. “The integrity of the upright will guide them, but the perversity of the treacherous will destroy them.” (Prov. 11:3). “A righteous person who walks in his integrity— How blessed are his sons after him.” (Prov. 20:7). “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity, than a person who is crooked, though he is rich.” (Prov. 28:6). “Praise the LORD! Blessed is a person who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.” (Ps. 112:1). “Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of the LORD. Blessed are those who comply with His testimonies, and seek Him with all their heart.” (Ps. 119:1-2; 128:1; Lk. 11:28).</p></li>
<li><p><u>A laborer of Jesus’ Church speaks words that will bring His protection</u>. For those with the faith to labor for Jesus, He will give them protection by helping them to control their words. “<strong><sup>3 </sup></strong><em>In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his back, but the lips of the wise will protect them</em>.” (Prov. 14:3). “Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 14:3).<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A co-builder of Jesus’ Church speaks His life to the lost</u>. Jesus wants you to control your words to speak His life to others who are lost, hurt, oppressed, in pain, in bondage, or in other forms of need. “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but if there is any good word for edification according to the need of the moment, say that, so that it will give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29). “Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.” (Col. 4:6). “but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, but with gentleness and respect;” (1 Pet. 3:15; Jam. 1:26; Matt. 12:36-37).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Believers should be encouraged to use their gifts to labor for Jesus’ Church</u>. Church leaders should also help members of the flock to develop and use their gifts to serve Jesus. “<strong><sup>4 </sup></strong><em>Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean; but much revenue comes by the strength of the ox</em>.” (Prov. 14:4). “The ox was used to plow the fields, and because of his labors there would be an abundant harvest. Where there is no ox the work is not being accomplished. This could apply to the church in the fact that where there are laborers that will work in the harvest, there will be increase.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 14:4).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Every believers should be encouraged to labor for Jesus<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>There is a great need for laborers to co-build Jesus’ Church by harvesting souls for Him</u>. Everyone is needed to serve as a laborer for Jesus. “And He was saying to them, ‘The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.”’ (Lk. 10:2; Matt. 9:37-38). “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together. For in this case the saying is true: ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have come into their labor.” (John 4:35-38). Thus, all should be encouraged to serve. “For the Scripture says, ‘You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing,’ and ‘The laborer is worthy of his wages.”’ (1 Tim. 5:18; 1 Cor. 9:9; Dt. 25:4).</p></li>

<h2 id="truth-to-live-out-jesus-wisdom-speak-his-truth-in-love.-prov.-145-9."><strong>2. <u>Truth: To Live Out Jesus’ Wisdom, Speak His Truth in Love</u>. Prov. 14:5-9.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A disciple of Jesus only speaks His truth in love</u>. A person seeking to live out Jesus’ wisdom should only speak truthfully and avoid lies and deceit. “<strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>A trustworthy witness will not lie, but a false witness declares lies</em>.” (Prov. 14:5). “<strong>A faithful witness does not lie</strong>: This simple and straightforward statement has much spiritual instruction in it. Jesus called His followers to be His witnesses (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Acts+1.8&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Acts 1:8</u></a>). One of the primary responsibilities of a witness is to simply <em>tell the truth</em> and to <strong>not lie</strong>. When we have a genuine faith and experience in the person and work of Jesus Christ, we can give simple, true witness to Him. <strong>A false witness will utter lies</strong>: Again, this simple statement points to a great spiritual truth. We should <em>never</em> be a <strong>false witness</strong> for Jesus Christ and utter <strong>lies</strong> about who He is and what He has done in our life.” (David Guzik on Prov. 14).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-14/media/image2.jpg" style="width:6.05223in;height:1.98758in" alt="Jesus Is The Truth Christian Cross - Jesus Christ - Sticker | TeePublic" /></p>
<p>To live according to Jesus’ wisdom, you must speak His truth<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Those who speak lies and deceit have no place in Jesus’ house</u>. God “hates” lies: “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>There are six things that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hates, seven that are an abomination to Him: … <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>a false witness who declares lies,...” (Prov. 6:16-19; 8:13). Liars who have not accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior can have no inheritance with His Church (Ps. 101:7; Rev. 21:8). Jesus is the truth (Jo. 14:6), and His truth sets you free (Jo. 8:32). Thus, you should only speak His truth out of love (Eph. 4:15).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek truth and knowledge through Jesus</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you must search it out from Him in faith. “<strong><sup>6 </sup></strong><em>A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge is easy for one who has understanding</em>.” (Prov. 14:6). “A scorner may affect to be seeking wisdom, but he can never attain to it, because it is given only to him who is meek and fears the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-9.htm"><u>Psalm 25:9</u></a>) … True wisdom is not to be won by those who are too conceited to receive instruction, and presume to depend upon their own judgment, and to weigh everything by their own standard. This is especially true of the knowledge of Divine things, which ‘scorners’ never really acquire. … This acquisition, as it is difficult, nay, impossible for the scorner, is comparatively easy for the humble believer who seeks it with the right temper and in the right way.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:6).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Rely upon Jesus for wisdom and truth and not your own understanding</u>. The Bible is clear that our wisdom and truth come from Yahweh, another name for Jesus. “For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” (Prov. 2:6). “But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1 Cor. 1:30). He gives wisdom to those who diligently seek Him. “I love those who love me; and those who diligently seek me will find me.” (Prov. 8:17; Jer. 29:13; Jam. 1:5; Matt. 7:7-8; Lk. 11:9-10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Seek Jesus’ truth and wisdom with other believers</u>. Solomon warns that you should avoid the fellowship of nonbelievers because they can pull you away from the wisdom that Yahweh reveals to you. “<strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Leave the presence of a fool, or you will not discern words of knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 14:7). “How can we practically apply Proverbs 14:7 to our lives? The most glaring application is to refrain from engaging with foolish people, as there is little to no benefit to us. How do we recognize a fool, however? The Bible describes a fool in the book of Proverbs in numerous places, giving us some telltale signs to look for. One of the biggest things to look out for is someone who thinks they know everything – a “know it all” type of person: Proverbs 12:15 – The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice. Another sign we see in The Bible about a fool is that they are always talking – and have a hard time listening to others, but seem intent on just expressing their opinion: Proverbs 18:2 – A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion. Yet another sign of a fool is someone who always wants to express their opinion, defend themselves, or jump to state their case immediately: Proverbs 12:16 – <u>The vexation of a fool is known at once</u>, but the prudent ignores an insult. We need to take the time to know and understand God’s Word so that when we are in the presence of a fool, we know how to act.” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 14:7).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Surround yourself with believers to discern Jesus’ truth</u>.  A faithful believer helps to guide others.  “One who walks with wise people will be wise, but a companion of fools will suffer harm.” (Prov. 13:20). “The righteous person is a guide to his neighbor, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.”  (Prov. 12:26).  Faithful believers will also help you to grow in your walk.  “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.” (Prov. 27:17).  In contrast, when you surround yourself with people trapped in sin, you can be pulled off your walk.  “Blessed is the person who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers!”  (Ps. 1:1). “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.”’  (1 Cor. 15:33; 2 Cor. 6:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>To walk in Jesus’ wisdom, take steps to ensure that you have not deviated from His path</u>. Because the heart is deceitful, the wise should constantly turn to Jesus to ensure that they remain on His narrow path. “<strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way, but the foolishness of fools is deceit</em>.” (Prov. 14:8). “The wise man will measure his steps to make sure that he is walking right. He checks for errors or failures, he learns from his mistakes, and tries to guide others in an upright way. The fool does not listen to words of wisdom, but turns a deaf ear to instructions.” (Ronald Young on Prov. 14:8).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Cling to Jesus’ wisdom to stay on His narrow path<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Cling to Jesus and don’t trust your heart to live out His wisdom</u>. Solomon warns that fools trust their hearts for guidance. “One who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but one who walks wisely will flee to safety.” (Prov. 28:26). Those who fear Jesus will instead cling to Him to receive His wisdom. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). The wise will also examine their own conduct to ensure that they have not deviated from Jesus’ narrow path. “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.” (Jam. 3:13; Eph. 5:15-17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Living in Jesus’ truth requires that you avoid sin</u>. You cannot claim that you are living out Jesus’ wisdom and truth if you embrace what He calls sinful. “<strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Fools mock at sin, but among the upright there is goodwill</em>.” (Prov. 14:9). “Jezebel is a prime example in the Word of God of one who made ‘a mock at sin.’ We are told to turn away from people who do that and have nothing to do with them.” (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 14:9).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A fool fails to take the consequences of sin seriously</u>. Living out Jesus’ wisdom and truth requires that you fear Him. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). The fear of Jesus is defined as hating evil (Prov. 8:13). Fools embrace evil and refuse to recognize Jesus as the sovereign Ruler over them. “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ They are corrupt, they have committed detestable acts; there is no one who does good.” (Ps. 14:1; Is. 32:6). “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: ‘He is the One who catches the wise by their craftiness’;” (1 Cor. 3:19; Ro. 1:21- 22).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trust-to-live-out-jesus-wisdom-trust-in-jesus.-prov.-1410-14."><strong>3. <u>Trust: To Live Out Jesus’ Wisdom, Trust in Jesus</u>. Prov. 14:10-14.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Trust Jesus to know your every need and struggle</u>. You can trust in Jesus’ wisdom because He knows your struggles, and He also suffered in human form. “<strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>The heart knows its own bitterness, and a stranger does not share its joy</em>.” (Prov. 14:10). “Neither our joys nor our sorrows can be wholly shared with another; no person stands in such intimate relation to us, or can put himself so entirely in our place, as to feel that which we feel. There is many a dark spot, many a grief, of which our best friend knows nothing; the skeleton is locked in the cupboard, and no one has the key but ourselves. But <strong>we</strong> can turn with confidence to the God-Man, Jesus, who knows our frame, who wept human tears, and bore our sorrows, and was in all points tempted like as we are, and who has taken his human experience with him into heaven.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:10).<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus knows your every struggle and battle</u>. Jesus treasures your every prayer and responds to them by giving you both comfort and the wisdom. “You have taken account of my miseries; put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?” (Ps. 56:8). “A Psalm of David. LORD, You have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I get up; You understand my thought from far away. You scrutinize my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, LORD, You know it all.” (Ps. 139:1-4; 1 Sam. 16:7).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust Jesus to walk by faith and not by sight</u>. Those who trust in Jesus’ wisdom to guide them will flourish with everlasting life. “<strong><sup>11 </sup></strong><em>The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish</em>.” (Prov. 14:11). “This proverb implicitly teaches the disciple to walk in faith, not by sight. Paradoxically, the wicked person’s house is less secure than the upright person’s tent. <em>The house</em> connotes a more secure and grand dwelling than a tent (see David’s desire to replace <em>I AM’s tent</em> with a <em>house</em> in 2 Sam. 7:4-6). That <em>of wicked people will be annihilated</em>. By contrast, <em>the tent of the upright people will bud</em> (or ‘sprout’). ‘Tent’ refers to a nomadic tent used as a dwelling. The metaphor ‘bud’ signifies that their households burgeon with life and prosperity. The seemingly unstable nomadic tent of the upright has stood from the time of the forefathers, and its inhabitants not only remain but forever flourish with new life (cf. Pss. 1:3; 92:12-14; John 15:1-17).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 14:11).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>While the wicked will pass away, those who trust in Jesus have an eternal inheritance</u>. It can sometimes be difficult to see how the wicked can frequently live with great comfort, wealth, and power. But what they have will not last. If you have the faith to trust Jesus, He promises you everlasting life. “For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; but the wicked will be eliminated from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it.” (Prov. 2:21-22). “When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, but the righteous has an everlasting foundation.” (Prov. 10:25). “For evildoers will be eliminated, but those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land. Yet a little while and the wicked person will be no more; and you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there. But the humble will inherit the land and will delight themselves in abundant prosperity…I have seen a wicked, violent person spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native soil. Then he passed away, and behold, he was no more; I searched for him, but he could not be found.” (Ps. 37:9-11; 35-36; Matt. 5:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in Jesus’ path for you</u>. Fools trust in their own instincts, intellect, and wealth. Those who are wise look to Jesus’ wisdom to stay on the right path. “<strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death</em>.” (Prov. 14:12). “The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 14:12).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/proverbs-14/media/image7.jpg" style="width:6.03207in;height:1.98181in" alt="Proverbs 14:12 - Bible verse - DailyVerses.net" /></p>
<p>Place your trust in Jesus’ Word, not in your instincts<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Don’t trust in your own instincts to find the right path</u>. For emphasis, Solomon later repeated this truth. “There is a way which seems right to a person, but its end is the way of death.” (Prov. 16:25). You cannot trust your instincts because the heart is deceitful. “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jer. 17:9). Our thoughts are also not God’s thoughts (Is. 55:8-9). Instead of trusting in your own instincts or public opinion, you must stay on Jesus’ narrow path. “Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted that leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matt. 7:13-14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in Jesus through the ups and downs of life</u>. The fool searches for contentment in fleeting emotions. True joy, contentment, and wisdom comes from Jesus. “<strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>Even in laughter the heart may be in pain, and the end of joy may be grief</em>.” (Prov. 14:13). “Many of our earthly joys die in the very act of being enjoyed. Those which depend on the gratification of some appetite expire in fruition, and at each recurrence are less and less complete …The saddest lives are those of pleasure-seekers, and the saddest deaths are those of the men who sought for joy where it was not to be found, and sought for their gratification in a world which leaves them, and which they have to leave. [But] [t]here is a realm where abide ‘fullness of joy and pleasures for ever more.’ … ‘Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.’” (Alexander MacLaren’s Expositions of Holy Scripture, Prov. 14:13).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in Jesus to find everlasting fulfillment</u>. While your motions of joy and grief on Earth can quickly come and go, Jesus offers to satisfy you with His living water in your innermost being. “Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, ‘If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.”’ (Jo. 7:37-38). In heaven, He will take away your sadness and suffering (Rev. 7:16-17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Trust in the things of the Spirit, not in the flesh</u>. A wise person finds contentment in the things of the Spirit, not in their worldly desires. “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong><em>One with a wayward heart will have his fill of his own ways, but a good person will be satisfied with his</em>.” (Prov. 14:14). “<a href="https://godsbless.ing/commentary/proverbs/proverbs_14_14/">Proverbs 14:14</a> delves into the profound connection between the condition of one’s heart and the outcomes of their actions. It draws a clear distinction between the consequences faced by those who stray from righteousness and those who remain steadfast in their faith. The phrase ‘The backslider in heart’ vividly portrays the image of someone who has veered off the path of righteousness, indicating a regression from their once-held moral principles. This regression often leads to a life filled with the repercussions of their choices, symbolized by being ‘filled with his own ways,’ which typically results in dissatisfaction and a sense of emptiness. Conversely, the verse highlights the contrasting experience of a “good man,” emphasizing that satisfaction and contentment stem from a life lived in alignment with God’s will. The phrase ‘A good man will be satisfied from above’ underscores the idea that true fulfillment is found in a relationship with God and adherence to His divine principles.” (Godsbless.ing on Prov. 14:14).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Trusting in the Spirit will reap heavenly fruits while trusting in the flesh will reap sorrow</u>. A wise person seeks to reap the fruit of the Spirit and not the deeds of the flesh. “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.” (Gal. 6:7-8; Ro. 8:5-7).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Test all things and be careful in your planning</u>. Because the heart is wicked and easily deceived, the wise tests and plans their paths. “<strong><sup>15 </sup></strong><em>The naive believes everything, but the sensible person considers his steps</em>.” (Prov. 14:15). “<strong>Believeth every word.—</strong>And so, having no fixed principles by which to go, often takes a wrong step; while the prudent man considers well (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-8.htm"><u>Proverbs 14:8</u></a>) whither each step will lead, and therefore does not go astray.” (Charles Ellicott’s Commentary for English Readers on Prov. 14:15).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<p>To discern good from evil, test everything against God’s Word<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Test everything so that you are not led astray</u>. Fools are lead astray when they fail to test what they are told against Jesus’ Word. “but examine everything; hold firmly to that which is good,” (1 Thess. 5:21). Believers must be weary of false prophets and spirits. “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.” (1 Jo. 4:1). “Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be as wary as serpents, and as innocent as doves.” (Matt. 10:16; Lk. 10:3). “Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.” (1 Cor. 14:20).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Be cautious to avoid evil</u>. Because the heart is easily deceived, the wise have the humility to be cautious to avoid evil influences. “<strong><sup>16 </sup></strong><em>A wise person is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is arrogant and careless</em>.” (Prov. 14:16). “In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-7.htm"><u>Proverbs 3:7</u></a> we had, ‘Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;’ but here the idea is different. A wise man fears the evil that lurks in everything, and examines and ponders actions by the standard of religion, and is thus saved from many evils which arise from hastiness and inadvertence … The fool easily falls into a rage, and has no control over himself, and is confident in his own wisdom, in contrast to the wise man, who has trust in God, and is calm and thoughtful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm"><u>Isaiah 30:15</u></a>).” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:16).<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Cling to Jesus and not your instincts to stay on His narrow path</u>. Fools trust in themselves to know the correct path. Those who are wise know evil by studying Jesus’ Word and seek to avoid it. “Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.” (Prov. 3:7). “A prudent person sees evil and hides himself, but the naive proceed, and pay the penalty.” (Prov. 22:3; 27:12). “No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” (2 Cor. 11:14). “Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” (1 Pet. 5:8). “Put on the full armor of God,….” (Eph. 6:11-12).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Use caution and care to restrain your tongue</u>. The wise also recognize that their hearts will often lead them to say evil things when left unrestrained. “<strong><sup>17 </sup></strong><em>A quick-tempered person acts foolishly, and a person of evil devices is hated</em>.” (Prov. 14:17). “This verse from Proverbs 14:17 offers us a striking glimpse into the character traits of those who are quick to anger and those who enact wicked plans. The initial part of the verse focuses on the consequences of being easily outraged. When we act out of anger, we may make unwise choices that we later regret. Anger can cloud our judgment and drive us to behaviors that stem from impulsive emotions rather than thoughtful consideration. With that in mind, it becomes clear that the characteristics of a person who is hot-tempered are often linked with foolishness. We can also reflect on how being easily angered can affect our relationships. It leads to misunderstanding, conflict, and ultimately, a distance between us and others.” (Christianitypath.com on Prov. 14:17).<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> </p></li>
<li><p><u>Control your anger when you are attacked</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you must also control your anger. “One who is slow to anger has great understanding; but one who is quick-tempered exalts foolishness.” (Prov. 14:29). “One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and one who rules his spirit, than one who captures a city.” (Prov. 16:32). “Do not be eager in your spirit to be angry, for anger resides in the heart of fools.” (Ecc. 7:9). “The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, patient when wronged,” (2 Tim. 2:24). “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless the faithful with a crown of knowledge</u>. Those with the faith to live out Jesus’ wisdom will be blessed with a crown of knowledge. “<strong><sup>18 </sup></strong><em>The naive inherit foolishness, but the sensible are crowned with knowledge</em>.” (Prov. 14:18). “In this passage, the term ‘simple’ refers to those who lack understanding or wisdom. They may be easily swayed by temptations or distractions, leading them to make unwise choices. The word ‘inherit’ implies that foolishness becomes a part of their identity; it is what they receive because they do not seek knowledge or understanding. On the other hand, the ‘prudent’ are those who are wise and thoughtful. They carefully consider their actions, and as a result, they gain knowledge that serves as a protective crown, guiding them away from folly and towards a fruitful life.” (Explainingthebible.com, Prov. 14:18).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The wise are faithful to follow Jesus</u>. Fools depend upon their own intellect and instincts to guide them through life. “Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.” (Prov. 3:7; Ro. 1:22). “This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic.” (Jam. 3:15). True wisdom begins by fearing Jesus. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:10). “Take care that no one deceives himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the sight of God. For it is written: “He is the One who catches the wise by their craftiness’;” (1 Cor. 3:18-19).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless the faithful with honor</u>. Those with the faith to live out Jesus’ wisdom will one day be blessed with honor. “<strong><sup>19 </sup></strong><em>The evil will bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous</em>.” (Prov. 14:19). “The final victory of good over evil is here set forth. However triumphant for a time and apparently prosperous the wicked may be, their success is not lasting; they shall in the end succumb to the righteous, even as the Canaanite kings crouched before Joshua's captains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm"><u>Joshua 10:24</u></a>), and, hurled from their high estate, they shall stand humbly at the good man's door, begging for bread to support their life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm"><u>1 Samuel 2:36</u></a>). The contrast here indicated is seen in our Lord's parable of Dives and Lazarus, when the beggar is comforted and the rich man is tormented, and when the latter urgently sues for the help of the once despised outcast to mitigate the agony which he is suffering.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:19).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Those with the faith to live in Jesus’ wisdom have an eternal inheritance</u>. While the wicked will one day be judged, Jesus will bless the faithful with eternal life. “For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; but the wicked will be eliminated from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it.” (Prov. 2:21-22). “For evildoers will be eliminated, but those who wait for the LORD, they will inherit the land … Wait for the LORD and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are eliminated, you will see it.” (Ps. 37:9, 34; Matt. 5:5).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful do not show favoritism based upon wealth</u>. While the world despises the poor and loves the rich, those who live out Jesus’ wisdom do not favor people based upon their wealth. “<strong><sup>20 </sup></strong><em>The poor is hated even by his neighbor, but those who love the rich are many</em>.” (Prov. 14:20). “Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 14:20).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful follow Jesus’ example in treating people equally</u>. God does not show favoritism. “Opening his mouth, Peter said: ‘I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality, but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.”’ (Acts 10:34-35). “For there is no partiality with God.” (Ro. 2:11). “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Gal. 3:28). Thus, believers should also not show favoritism to others based upon worldly traits (Jam. 2:1-6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful are blessed when helping the poor</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, He calls on you to be gracious to the poor. “<strong><sup>21 </sup></strong><em>One who despises his neighbor sins, but one who is gracious to the poor is blessed</em>.” (Prov. 14:21). “<strong>He who despises his neighbor sins</strong>: Men and women are made in the image of God, and therefore we are commanded to love our neighbor (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Leviticus+19.18&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Leviticus 19:18</u></a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+22.39&amp;t=NKJV"><u>Matthew 22:39</u></a>). To despise is to hate, so to despise your neighbor is to sin. <strong>He who has mercy on the poor, happy is he</strong>: The generous heart is the happy heart. The link between the first and second lines of this proverb shows that whoever <strong>has mercy on the poor</strong> should never do it in a superior manner that would show they despise the <strong>poor</strong> they say they help.” (David Guzik on Prov. 14:21).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Your treatment of those in need should reflect your faith in Jesus</u>. Jesus warns that people will be held accountable based upon whether they showed His love to the poor. “Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.’ Then the righteous will answer Him, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You as a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine, you did it for Me.’ Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;” (Matt. 25:34-41; 1 Jo. 3:17).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful control their thoughts and actions</u>. If your evil thoughts are left unchecked, they will most likely turn into evil actions. Thus, the wise will seek to renew their minds in Jesus and avoid evil. “<strong><sup>22 </sup></strong><em>Will they who devise evil not go astray? But kindness and truth will be to those who devise good</em>.” (Prov. 14:22). “The verse compares two different groups of people—those who plot evil and those who devise good. It suggests that there are consequences to our choices. We can either be guided by evil intentions, which ultimately lead us astray, or we can choose to plan good, which brings loyalty and faithfulness into our lives. This is a powerful encouragement for us to reflect on the paths we choose and the thoughts we entertain … The verse warns that those who engage in these negative thoughts and actions are likely to find themselves lost, not only in their own life trajectory but also in their relationships with others. Evil intentions may provide temporary gratification, but they often lead to significant consequences that can be damaging both to ourselves and those around us.” (Christianitypath.com).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>A person’s unchecked thoughts will ultimately become visible as the fruit of their actions</u>. Faithful believers will guard their hearts. “Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.” (Prov. 4:23). You can see if a person’s heart is guarded by their actions. “So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So then, you will know them by their fruits.” (Matt. 7:17-20). “For there is no good tree that bears bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree that bears good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush. The good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil person out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart.” (Lk. 6:43-45). Believers should turn to Jesus to renew their minds every day and avoid embracing what is evil (Ro. 12:2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful are blessed when they diligently labor for Jesus</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you should work hard for His Church and in what He calls you to do. “<strong><sup>23 </sup></strong><em>In all labor there is profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty</em>.” (Prov. 14:23). “Diligent labour is the ready way to riches, but idle talking, wherein too many spend most of their precious thee, will bring a man to poverty.” (Matthew Poole’s Commentary on Prov. 14:23).<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Labor for Jesus, and He will provide for your needs<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>The righteous who labor hard for Jesus will lack no good thing</u>. In other proverbs, Solomon observes: “One who works his land will have plenty of food, but one who follows empty pursuits will have plenty of poverty.” (Prov. 28:19; 21:5). But these promises must be read in the full context of Scripture. Jesus provides for those who diligently labor for Him. “But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” (Matt. 6:33). Those who sow greatly for Jesus will also reap greatly from His blessings, even though they may be spiritual (2 Cor. 9:6).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful recognize Jesus’ wisdom as a blessing greater than gold</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you must see it as one of your greatest treasures. “<strong><sup>24 </sup></strong><em>The crown of the wise is their riches, but the foolishness of fools is simply foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 14:24). “Proverbs 14:24 is a verse that speaks to the value of wisdom and the consequences of foolishness. It contrasts the outcomes of living wisely versus living foolishly. The ‘crown’ symbolizes achievement and recognition, indicating that wise living brings tangible and intangible rewards. On the other hand, ‘But the folly of fools is folly’ emphasizes the self-perpetuating nature of foolishness. Foolish actions lead to more foolishness, creating a cycle of poor decisions and negative outcomes.” (Godsblessing.ing on Prov. 14:24).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus’ wisdom is a treasure more valuable than gold</u>. The wise understand that Jesus’ wisdom is greater than any treasure. “Blessed is a person who finds wisdom, and one who obtains understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her produce better than gold.” (Prov. 3:13-14; 8:11; Ecc. 7:12). “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold everything that he had and bought it.” (Matt. 13:44-46).</p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful understand that Jesus alone offers the path to salvation</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, share the truth of salvation through Him. “<strong><sup>25 </sup></strong><em>A truthful witness saves lives, but one who declares lies is deceitful</em>.” (Prov. 14:25). “The Lord Jesus said it this way: ‘… if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch.”’ (J. Vernon McGee on Prov. 14:25).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The faithful are a witness to the truth and wisdom of faith in Jesus</u>. Those who are wise will tell others that there is only one name that offers eternal life. “And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.” (1 Jo. 5:20). “and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (Jo. 8:32). “Therefore, ridding yourselves of falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, because we are parts of one another.” (Eph. 4:25; Ro. 6:18). “but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not walking in trickery nor distorting the word of God, but by the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person’s conscience in the sight of God.” (2 Cor. 4:2; 1 Pet. 2:1; Ps. 15:2).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus brings confidence and refuge</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, fear Him by hating evil. You can then live with confidence. “<strong><sup>26 </sup></strong><em>In the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> there is strong confidence, and his children will have refuge</em>.” (Prov. 14:26). “The fear of the Lord causes us to turn away from sin, turn to God, and live our lives in a way that is pleasing to Him. This then has a ripple or knock-on effect on our children, and we leave them a godly inheritance. This is why the second part of Proverbs 14:26<strong> </strong>says that ‘his children will have a refuge.’ Righteous and godly living not only impacts our lives, but our children are benefactors of it as well!” (Biblicallywise.com on Prov. 14:26).<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus protects those who fear Him and take refuge in Him</u>. If you fear Jesus and avoid evil, His angels will protect you. “The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them.” (Ps. 34:7). “My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, since I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.” (Dan. 6:22). If you take refuge in Jesus, He will also become your shield against evil. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5; 18:10; Ps. 91:1-2).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus brings the blessing of the fountain of life</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, have faith in the abundant life that He offers you and avoid false worldly substitutes. “<strong><sup>27</sup></strong> <em>The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a fountain of life, by which one may avoid the snares of death</em>.” (Prov. 14:27). “The fear of the Lord can be called a fountain of life, because, showing itself in obedience, it nourishes the flowers and fruits of faith, produces graces and virtues, and prepares the soul for immortality.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:27).<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus offers living waters to all who trust in Him</u>. While fools turn to the world for contentment, the wise will find living water through Jesus. “but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.” (Jo. 4:14). He also offers stability for those who fear Him and consider His wisdom to be a great treasure. “And He will be the stability of your times, a wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is his treasure.” (Is. 33:6; Ps. 111:10; Prov. 3:13-14; 16:16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fear Jesus with reverence amongst the body of Christ</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you should also show your loving reverence by worshiping Him in a church community of fellow believers. “<strong><sup>28 </sup></strong><em>In a multitude of people is a king’s glory, but in the scarcity of people is a prince’s ruin</em>.” (Prov. 14:28). “In the multitude of people is the king's honour,.... This is true of the King of kings, of Jesus Christ, who is King of saints; his honour and glory, as Mediator, lies in a large number of voluntary subjects, made ‘willing’ to serve him …” (John Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible, Prov. 14:28).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus is the King of Kings and worthy of your worship</u>. Solomon gave thanks because God made him king over multitudes of people. “Now, LORD God, Your promise to my father David is fulfilled, for You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.” (2 Chr. 1:9). While all the people of Israel bowed before Solomon, all will one day bow to Jesus. “so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:10-11; Is. 45:23; 60:3).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus leads to restraint</u>. Those seeking to live out Jesus’ wisdom will also restrain their tongues. “<strong><sup>29 </sup></strong><em>One who is slow to anger has great understanding; but one who is quick-tempered exalts foolishness</em>.” (Prov. 14:29). “<em>He that is slow to wrath, </em>— He who is not soon provoked to anger by reproaches or ill usage, shows himself to be a wise and great man; <em>but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly — </em>Exposes his folly, and makes it apparent to everybody.” (Joseph Benson’s Commentary on Prov. 14:29).<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Fearing Jesus includes avoiding evil speech</u>. You can also show your fear of Jesus by abstaining from hatred, unforgiveness, slander, and other forms of evil speech. “You know this, my beloved brothers and sisters. Now everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; for a man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.” (Jam. 1:19-20; Prov. 15:18; Ecc. 7:9; Matt. 5:22).</p></li>

<li><p><u>Jesus offers the blessing of tranquility</u>. Those with the faith to live out Jesus’ righteousness will be blessed with His peace. “<strong><sup>30 </sup></strong><em>A tranquil heart is life to the body, but jealousy is rottenness to the bones</em>.” (Prov. 14:30). “Sound heart - literally, ‘heart of health,’ that in which all emotions and appetites are in a healthy equilibrium. The contrast with this is the envy which eats, like a consuming disease, into the very bones and marrow of a man's moral life.” (Albert Barnes Notes on the Bible, Prov. 14:30).<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The fruit of Jesus’ righteousness includes abstaining from evil emotions</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you must also abstain from anger, wrath, hatred, and other forms of evil. “Cease from anger and abandon wrath; do not get upset; it leads only to evildoing.” (Ps. 37:8). “All bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander must be removed from you, along with all malice.” (Eph. 4:31; Col. 3:8; 1 Pet. 2:1; Phil. 4:7).</p></li>

<p>Pursue Jesus’ righteousness and find peace and contentment in Him<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus also wants you to help the poor</u>. To live out Jesus’ wisdom, you must also help those in need. Those who oppress the poor will be disciplined or judged. “<strong><sup>31 </sup></strong><em>One who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker, but one who is gracious to the needy honors Him</em>.” (Prov. 14:31). God “hath placed men in their several conditions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-5.htm"><u>Proverbs 17:5</u></a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-2.htm"><u>Proverbs 22:2</u></a>). ‘The poor shall never cease out of the land’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm"><u>Deuteronomy 15:11</u></a>); "The poor ye have always with you,’ said Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm"><u>Matthew 26:11</u></a>); therefore to harass and oppress the poor because he is in this lowly condition, is virtually to arraign the providence of God, who is the Father of all, and has made all men brothers, however differing in worldly position. Christ puts the duty of aiding the poor on the high ground of his solidarity with his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm"><u>Matthew 25:40, 45</u></a>), how that in ministering unto the least of these his brethren men are ministering unto him.” (Pulpit Commentary on Prov. 14:31).<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reward those who help the poor</u>. Jesus will bless those with the faith to help others. “One who is gracious to a poor person lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” (Prov. 19:17). “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine, you did it for Me.’” (Matt. 25:40). “But whoever has worldly goods and sees his brother or sister in need, and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God remain in him?” (1 Jo. 3:17; Jam. 2:15-16).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Jesus will reward those made righteous through faith with eternal life</u>. Those who find righteousness through faith will also find eternal life while those who reject Him will suffer an eternity separated from Him. “<strong><sup>32 </sup></strong><em>The wicked is thrust down by his own wrongdoing, but the righteous has a refuge when he dies</em>.” (Prov. 14:32). “The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them.” (Matthew Henry on Prov. 14:32).<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>Faith in Jesus offers eternal life</u>. The wages of sin are death. But Jesus offers eternal life. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:23). “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.” (Jo. 3:16; 5:24). “Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.” (Jo. 6:47; Ro. 10:9-10).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Continually guard your heart to stay on Jesus’ path</u>. The pursuit of Jesus’ righteousness includes continually guarding your heart. “<strong><sup>33 </sup></strong><em>Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding, but among fools it is made known</em>.” (Prov. 14:33). “<strong>Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding</strong>: The idea is that <strong>wisdom</strong> finds a suitable home <strong>in the heart</strong> of those who have wisdom (<strong>understanding</strong>). It isn’t like a temporary visitor; it comes and <strong>rests in the heart</strong> … <strong>What is in the heart of fools is made known</strong>: The wisdom of a wise man’s heart will be revealed; so will the folly of the fool’s <strong>heart</strong>. What we <em>are</em> is eventually evident in what we <em>do</em>.” (David Guzik on Prov. 14:33).<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><u>The fruit of a person following Jesus’ righteousness will be evident by their actions</u>. Those who are wise will guard their hearts. “Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.” (Prov. 4:23). You will know a person who is pursuing Jesus’ righteousness by the fruit of their actions. “Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.” (Jam. 3:13). “A wise person’s heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish person’s heart directs him toward the left.” (Ecc. 10:2; Matt. 12:34-35).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Following Jesus’ righteousness brings Jesus’ favor to the nation</u>. If a nation pursues Jesus’ righteousness, it will also be blessed. “<strong><sup>34 </sup></strong><em>Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people</em>.” (Prov. 14:34). “Proverbs 14:34 is a powerful verse that speaks to the moral and ethical foundation of a nation. It emphasizes the importance of righteousness and the consequences of sin…righteousness refers to living according to God’s laws and moral principles, exalts means to lift up, honor, or elevate. This phrase suggests that when a nation collectively adheres to righteous living, it elevates in status, prosperity, and respect. On the other hand, ‘sin is a reproach to any people.’ – sin refers to actions that go against God’s will and moral laws, reproach means disgrace or disapproval. This phrase indicates that sin brings shame, dishonor, and negative consequences to a community or nation.” (Godsblissing.ing on Prov. 14:34).<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>

<p><img src="/proverbs-14/media/image1.jpg" style="width:6.04167in;height:3.4707in" alt="Daily Encouragement (Archive Edition)" /></p>
<p>God will bless any nation that repents and turns back to Him<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>A nation that repents and turns to Jesus will be blessed</u>. God promises to bless any nation that obeys Him. “Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I am commanding you today, that the LORD your God will put you high above all the nations of the earth. And all these blessings will come to you and reach you if you obey the LORD your God:” (Dt. 28:1-2; Prov. 33:12). God will also punish those nations which reject Him (Is. 60:12). But He will forgive any nation that repents of its sins. “and My people who are called by My name humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” (2 Chron. 7:14).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Following Jesus’ righteousness also brings Jesus’ favor to the individual</u>. Even if your nation will not turn back, Jesus will bless you when you repent and serve Him. “<strong><sup>35 </sup></strong><em>The king’s favor is toward a servant who acts wisely, but his anger is toward him who acts shamefully</em>.” (Prov. 14:35). “The moral posture of a nation depends largely on its officials. The righteous <em>king’s favor</em> (see 11:1; 14:28) <em>comes to a prudent</em> … <em>servant</em> (<em>‘ebed</em>; to the king (see 30:9). <em>But his fury</em> (or ‘wrath’; see 11:4; cf. Amos 1:11) <em>ruins a shameful [servant]</em>. The proverb admonishes the king to promote competence, loyalty, and efficiency in governing and not to tolerate mismanagement and corruption (cf. 16:13; 15; 19:12). It also admonishes officials to be competent and conscious in their actions and to prepare for promotion by eschewing scandal and criticism. Christ taught this lesson in his parable of the ten virgins, the talents, and the sheep and goats in Matt. 25 (cf. John 12:26).” (Bruce Waltke and Ivan De Silva on Proverbs Prov. 14:35).<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Live according to Jesus’ righteous example, and He will honor you<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Jesus will bless all with the faith to pursue His righteousness</u>. Jesus will honor those with the faith to repent of their sins and serve Him. “His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter the joy of your master.’” (Matt. 25:21; Lk. 19:17; Mal. 1:6).</p></li>
